440,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,233,SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,233.1,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES England & Wales,233.1.1,,"The Parent Guarantor is incorporated as a private limited company under the laws of England and Wales. The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. This is in contrast to arbitral awards, which are often easier to enforce under the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral awards, to which the UK is a signatory. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action may be conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English private international law); - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive in the court which pronounced it (which includes a judgment that may be open to review by the same court, or open to appeal); - the U.S. judgment being for a debt for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law. A U.S. injunction, for example, cannot be enforced by an English court; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud, duress, undue influence or any bribe or corrupt conduct, or in breach of English principles of natural justice (meaning, for example, that the defendant had due notice and an opportunity to be heard); - the U.S. judgment remaining valid and enforceable in the court in which it was obtained; - the U.S. judgment not being inconsistent with a prior judgment on the same subject matter between the same parties; ----- - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.; - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court; and - the application to enforce the U.S. judgment being made in the English courts by the person in whom the rights are vested under the judgment within the relevant period applicable under English law (including English rules on conflict of laws). Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further, it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",,as_expected,2024,190,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The Parent Guarantor is incorporated as a private limited company under the laws of England and Wales.

440,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Company Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a global manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original equipment manufacturers (“first-fit”) as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, including: automotive replacement and first-fit; diversified industrial; industrial off-highway, industrial on-highway, and personal mobility. Our net sales have historically been, and remain, highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. We sell our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built over more than 110 years since Gates’ founding in 1911. Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are often critical components in applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in natural, and often preventative, replacement cycles that drive high-margin, recurring revenue.

440,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Solutions,9.2.1,"Power Transmission. Our power transmission solutions transfer power, convey materials and provide","motion control. They are used in applications in which belts, chains, cables, geared transmissions or direct drives transfer power from an engine motor or other source of mechanical power to another part or system. Our belts are made of highly engineered polymer formulations, fabrics or textiles (made from a variety of polymer or natural fibers) and embedded cords for reinforcement (which may be made from polymers such as polyesters or aramids, fiberglass or high performance carbon fibers). Many of these materials are proprietary to Gates. Within our power transmission segment, we offer solutions across the following key application platforms: - _Stationary drives: fixed drive systems such as those used in a factory driving a machine or pump, on a grain elevator driving the lift auger or in a distribution center driving automated equipment such as conveyor lines or robotic picking machines; - _Mobile drives: drives on a piece of mobile machinery such as the threshing and separation drives on a combine harvester; - _Engine systems: synchronous drives and related components for cam shaft drives, auxiliary drives and asynchronous accessory drives for air conditioning (“A/C”) compressors, power steering, alternators and starter/generator systems; and - _Personal mobility: drives on motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, both traditional and electric, as well as on snowmobiles and other power sports vehicles that are used to transfer power between the power source and the drive wheel(s) or track. Customers choose power transmission solutions based on a number of factors, including application requirements such as load, speed, gear ratio, temperature, operating environment, ease of maintenance, noise, efficiency and reliability, as well as the support they receive from their suppliers, including application-specific engineering services. Belt-based drive systems have many advantages over other alternatives, as they are typically clean, low-maintenance, lubrication-free, quiet with low-vibration, lightweight, compact, energy-efficient, durable and reliable. Belt-based power transmission drives typically consist of either a synchronous belt (such as a timing belt) or an asynchronous belt (such as a V-belt, continuously-variable transmission (“CVT”) belt or Micro-V® belt) and related components (sprockets, pulleys, mechanical water pumps, tensioners or other accessories). In addition, we also manufacture metal drive components and assemble certain product kits for the automotive replacement channel. _Asynchronous Belts. Asynchronous belts are our highest-volume products and are used in a broad range of_ applications. We were a pioneer in the design and manufacturing of V-belts, which draw their name from the shape of their profile. We also manufacture “ribbed” V-belts, which are belts with lengthwise V-shaped grooves, which we market under the Micro-V[®] name. This design results in a thinner belt for the same drive surface, making it more flexible and offering improved efficiency. In industrial end markets, asynchronous belts have a wide variety of applications, including use in pump drives, manufacturing lines, HVAC systems, industrial, truck, bus and marine engines, forestry and mining equipment and many other applications. CVT systems often found in scooters, power sports vehicles and other applications use a specialized V-belt known as a CVT belt. In automotive applications, our asynchronous belts perform functions that include transferring power from the crankshaft to accessory drive components such as the alternator, A/C compressor, power steering system, water pump and, in some vehicles, a belt/starter generator system used in start/stop accessory drive systems to improve fuel economy. ----- Recently, Gates introduced a new Micro-V[®] platform for engine accessory drive systems. The combination of newly developed material compounds and product design utilizes less material, reduces belt weight and results in lower bending stiffness. These improvements enable tighter pulley configurations and reduced drive bending losses as compared to previous belt technologies; lower losses result in benefits such as reduced energy consumption, CO2 emissions and heat generation. _Synchronous Belts. Synchronous belts, also known as timing belts, are non-slipping mechanical drive belts._ They have molded teeth and run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. Synchronous belts experience no slippage and are often used to transfer high levels of power or to control motion for indexing or timing purposes, as well as for linear positioning and positive drive conveying. They are typically used instead of chains or gears and we believe they have a number of advantages over these alternatives, including less noise, no need for lubrication, improved durability and performance and a more compact design. Examples of industrial applications include use in HVAC systems, food processing and bottling plants, mining and agricultural equipment, automated doors, warehouse systems and robotics. Our synchronous belts are also utilized in personal mobility vehicles, including both traditional and electric motorcycles, bicycles and scooters, applications in which clean, quiet performance is often valued. In automotive applications, our synchronous belts are used to synchronize the rotation of the engine crankshaft with the camshaft in a valve train system, as well as in electric power steering, parking brake and accessory drive systems which are present in internal-combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. In recent years, Gates also launched the PowerGrip[®] GT[®]4 a high-torque synchronous belt for industrial applications. This new belt leverages Gates’ materials science and process engineering capabilities, to provide a belt construction that replaces chloroprene-based elastomers with an advanced ethylene elastomer formulation that is more environmentally friendly. It has the highest power-carrying capacity in its segment, a wider operating temperature range and increased chemical resistance, allowing for narrower drives and a broad range of applications to be served with both first-fit and replacement channel customers. In recent years, Gates launched the Carbon Drive CDC[®] synchronous belt designed for commuter bicycle applications and in Fiscal 2022 Gates launched the Carbon Drive Moto X5 synchronous belt designed specifically for mid-motor, sit-down electric scooters and motorcycles typically found in commuting applications in the rapidly evolving Asian market. In Fiscal 2022, Gates launched an updated version of Gates Design Power, an award-wining new digital toolkit consisting of six modules, including four all-new applications and substantially upgraded versions of well-known Gates digital tools, Design IQ™ and Design Flex Pro™. Among the all-new programs is the industry-first Mobility Drive Analysis tool aimed at making it easier for engineers from bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, and power sports Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) to design Gates’ clean, quiet, durable and low-maintenance Carbon Drive belt systems into their next-generation vehicles to further accelerating conversion from chain and other technologies. In Fiscal 2023, Gates announced the launch of the mobile version of Gates Design Power, putting advanced digital design tools to support the engineering of belt drive systems on customers’ mobile devices. Additionally, Gates expanded its G-Force product portfolio by introducing the G-Force Workhorse CVT belt for specialty and recreation vehicles. The G-Force Workhorse belt offers more longevity and increased compatibility for end users relative to its predecessor. _Metal Drive Components. We source, manufacture and sell tensioners, idlers, pulleys, sprockets and other_ components used in belt drive systems. These products are designed and engineered to work efficiently with our belts. Tensioners are devices that maintain a constant tension in the belt drive system, thereby ensuring proper function and preventing loss of power or system failure. Tensioners typically employ a spring-loaded arm and a damping mechanism to help control tension in a belt drive system. Idlers, which sometimes also perform as tensioners, are used to take up extra belt length. Gates’ pulleys and sprockets are precisely engineered for positive press fit, designed to optimize the performance and durable working service life of the belt drive system. _Kits. Our kits for the automotive replacement channel include all of the parts needed by an automotive_ service shop to perform a replacement of one of our products. Kits are created for specific vehicle makes and models and typically include belts, tensioners and idlers, and will sometimes also include water pumps, which are often replaced simultaneously with a timing belt due to the relatively high labor component in the total cost of a typical replacement. Our kits are convenient for service technicians as they eliminate the need for more complicated product ----- sourcing. On a comparable quantity basis, kits typically sell at a premium to a loose belt and the individual related components. Our power transmission products are used in a broad range of applications in end markets including: automotive replacement and first-fit, diversified industrial, industrial off-highway, industrial on-highway, energy and resources, and personal mobility. The majority of our Fiscal 2023 net sales came from replacement channels, which provide high-margin, recurring revenue streams and are driven by attractive market trends. The bulk of our power transmission replacement business resides in developed regions, in which a large, aging installed base of equipment follows a natural maintenance cycle and is served by well-established distribution channels. For example, a combine harvester can have over 25 high-performance belts that are typically replaced at regular intervals, depending on wear and tear, with end users having access to replacement parts through a large network of distributors. Similarly, in the mature automotive aftermarkets such as North America and Europe, maintenance intervals are well defined, and miles (or kilometers) driven per vehicle and the average vehicle age have generally been increasing, leading to more wear and tear on vehicles. A smaller portion of our power transmission replacement business is generated in emerging markets, which generally have a smaller base of installed equipment and relatively nascent distribution channels. As they continue to develop, these replacement channels in emerging markets represent a significant long-term opportunity for growth. In addition to our power transmission replacement business, we also serve a wide variety of well-known first-fit customers across all of our end markets.",,as_expected,2024,190,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""We also serve a wide variety of well-known first-fit customers across all of our end markets.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""We also serve a wide variety of well-known first-fit customers across all of our end markets.""}, ""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""We also serve a wide variety of well-known first-fit customers across all of our end markets."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Power Transmission.

We also provide Gates-engineered and third-party crimping systems to ensure a proper interface is obtained between our hoses and these metal components to create high-quality, robust hydraulic assemblies. In recent years, Gates introduced a new premium product family consisting of hydraulic hoses that are lighter weight and more flexible. Made with a high-performance reinforcement and robust, abrasion-resistant cover, the MXT line of hydraulic hose is comprised of universally applicable, high-performance products that meet the needs of a wide range of applications. Subsequently, we launched the MXG line of hydraulic hose, a flexible, lightweight solution with increased durability and temperature performance, designed to replace conventional spiral hoses typically used in the most demanding applications. We also launched a smart e-crimper, which is a machine used to attach fittings to hydraulic hoses. In addition to convenient, web-enabled access to training content and product crimp specs, this new crimper can be used with Gates\u2019 intuitive mobile eCrimp app. In Fiscal 2022, we launched the ProV hose family in Europe, which is an addition to our Pro Series product portfolio that leverages technologies developed and first launched in our MXT and MXG product lines. _Thermal and Emissions Management. Our thermal and emissions management and related products_ perform a variety of fluid conveyance, emissions reduction and efficiency improvement functions in electric, hybrid and internal combustion passenger and commercial vehicles. In electric applications, Gates offers hose and electric water pump solutions for the thermal management system regulating the battery, inverter, motor(s) and passenger compartment. In internal combustion applications, Gates primarily provides thermal management hose and water pumps for engine cooling, selective catalytic reduction hoses that are part of systems that reduce harmful emissions from diesel engines and hoses for functions that improve air intake and engine efficiency. In Fiscal 2021, we launched a new line of ThermalPro electric water pumps for OEM and aftermarket applications, broadening Gates presence in hybrid and battery electric vehicle as well as other thermal management applications like data center cooling. _Industrial Hose. Our industrial hoses are used to transfer a wide range of substances - chemicals, food,_ beverages, petroleum, fuels, bulk materials, water, steam and air - to meet the requirements of a diverse range of applications, including manufacturing, mining, oil and gas drilling, marine, agriculture, industrial cleaning and construction. Our application engineering teams work with customers to assist them in selecting the appropriate hose solution to safely meet their operational needs. We leverage our materials science expertise to design hoses that perform at varying pressures and levels of resistance to chemicals, oil, abrasion, ozone, flame and both hot and cold temperatures. For performance in extreme environments, many of our industrial hoses feature both crush-resistant and flexible designs. Gates industrial hoses are highly engineered to meet or exceed a multitude of industry standards and certifications, and are offered in a range of diameters, lengths and colors to allow customers to differentiate the hoses in applications. We also offer a wide range of couplings to provide complete assembly solutions. Our fluid power products are used in numerous applications in end markets including automotive replacement and first-fit; diversified industrial; industrial off-highway; industrial on-highway; energy and resources; and personal mobility. The largest portion of our Fiscal 2023 fluid power revenue came from replacement markets. Within these replacement markets, the majority of our revenue came from industrial applications.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

EBITDA is widely used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). Management uses “Adjusted EBITDA” as its key profitability measure. This is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA before certain items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our measure of segment profitability to assess the performance of our businesses, and it is used for total Gates as well because we believe it is important to consider our profitability on a basis that is consistent with that of our operating segments, as well as that of certain of our peer companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA should, therefore, be made available to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the performance of our businesses. During the periods presented, the items excluded from EBITDA in computing Adjusted EBITDA primarily included: - non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation; - transaction-related expenses incurred in relation to major corporate transactions, including the acquisition of businesses, and equity and debt transactions; - asset impairments; - restructuring expenses, including severance related expenses; - credit loss related to a customer bankruptcy; - cybersecurity incident expenses and - inventory adjustments related to certain inventories accounted for on the LIFO basis. Differences exist among our businesses and from period to period in the extent to which their respective employees receive share-based compensation or a charge for such compensation is recognized. We therefore exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation in order to assess the relative performance of our businesses. We exclude from Adjusted EBITDA acquisition-related costs that are required to be expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also exclude costs associated with major corporate transactions because we do not believe that they relate to our performance. Other items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because they are individually or collectively significant items that are not considered to be representative of the underlying performance of our businesses. During the periods presented, we excluded restructuring expenses and severance-related expenses that reflect specific, strategic actions taken by management to shutdown, downsize, or otherwise fundamentally reorganize areas of Gates’ business, and changes in the LIFO inventory reserve recognized in cost of sales for certain inventories that are valued on a LIFO basis. During inflationary or deflationary pricing environments, LIFO adjustments can result in variability of the cost of sales recognized each period as the most recent costs are matched against current sales, while historical, typically lower, costs are retained in inventory. LIFO adjustments are determined based on published pricing indices, which often are not representative of the actual cost changes or timing of those changes as experienced by our business. Excluding the impact from the application of LIFO therefore improves the comparability ----- of our financial performance from period to period and with the Company’s peers, and more closely represents the physical flow of our inventory and how we manage the business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore, be used in conjunction with, not as substitutes for, profit or loss for the period. Management compensates for these limitations by separately monitoring net income from continuing operations for the period. Under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments and paying certain dividends is governed, in part, by our ability to satisfy tests based on Covenant EBITDA.

Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including the following: - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; - limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; - placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and - increasing our cost of borrowing. If we incur substantial additional debt, from time to time, the risks related to our high level of debt could increase.

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) the issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - the issuer or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or the guarantees; - the issuance of the notes or guarantees left the issuer or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business in which such issuer or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or - the issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that it would, incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of such issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in the acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a ----- court would use to determine whether or not the issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that an issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee and/or lien if such issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes.

If a court were to hold a guarantee unenforceable, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee of the notes. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the issuer or the applicable guarantor. Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by an issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time such issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to such issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such issuer’s or guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any noninsider party and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against the issuer or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. -----",,as_expected,2024,190,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The issuance of the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review under federal and state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes (including federal bankruptcy laws), if an action (either in connection with a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization case or under a lawsuit in which a bankruptcy is not involved), were commenced at some future date by an issuer, by the guarantors or on behalf of unpaid creditors of the issuer or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor.

As of March 30, 2024, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions: - the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had $2,366.4 million in total indebtedness outstanding (excluding approximately $28.6 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit), none of which would have been subordinated and of which $1,866.4 million would have been senior secured indebtedness, consisting entirely of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; and - the Issuer would have had $500.0 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the revolving portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (after giving effect to approximately $28.6 million of outstanding letters of credit). All of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” unless designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Indenture. Under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our existing and future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. For the twelve months ended March 30, 2024, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 75% of our revenues and approximately 74% of our Adjusted EBITDA. As of March 30, 2024, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 68% of our total assets and approximately 65% of our total liabilities. As of March 30, 2024, after adjusting for certain structural intercompany loan assets and liabilities that largely offset each other, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 68% of our total assets and approximately 25% of our total liabilities. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, such non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may be incurred by the Parent Guarantor or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Subsidiaries. As of ----- the Issue Date, the Parent Guarantor and each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees our Senior Secured Credit Facilities will guarantee the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, or consummate a Division as the Dividing Person, or sell all or substantially all its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor without limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants— Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.” Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with or is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments thereof); (2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated, but with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantors, to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”); (3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (4) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or Division of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation or winding up of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with or in a manner not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (5) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; ----- (6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”; (7) the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or (8) in the case of the Parent Guarantor, if the Parent Guarantor ceases to be the parent of the Issuer as a result of a transaction or designation permitted pursuant to the definition of the “Parent Guarantor”. Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur, then the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions reasonably necessary to provide that the Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantors, to the extent such guarantee is required by the covenant described under “— Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer and at the Issuer’s expense, will execute such documents reasonably requested by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination.

The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions may have different Redemption Dates or may specify the order in which redemptions taking place on the same Redemption Date are deemed to occur. In addition, if such redemption or offer to purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer\u2019s (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) in its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed, or that such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer\u2019s (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) sole discretion. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice or offer to purchase that payment ----- of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer\u2019s obligations with respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person. The Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, its direct and indirect equityholders, including the Investors, any of its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and members of our management may acquire the Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes or withdraw such election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. ----- On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by them or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with a paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (which may include a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “— Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Required Holders. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. ----- A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Change of Control Offer and the Alternate Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

Within 18 months after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and (B) the receipt of any Net Proceeds of such Asset Sale, the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may apply an amount not to exceed the Applicable Asset Sale Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (the “Applicable Proceeds”), (1) to reduce or offer to reduce Indebtedness (through a redemption, prepayment, repayment or purchase, as applicable) as follows: (a) Obligations under a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Applicable Proceeds are applied, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of the Applicable Proceeds of any Asset Sale or Casualty Event by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor (a “Non-Guarantor Disposition”) (A) is (x) prohibited or delayed by or would violate or conflict with applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States (including for the avoidance of doubt restrictions, prohibitions or impediments relating to financial assistance, corporate benefit, thin capitalization, capital maintenance and similar legal principles, restrictions on upstreaming and/or cross-streaming of Cash Equivalents intra-group and relating to the fiduciary and/or statutory duties of the directors (or equivalent Persons) of the Parent Guarantor and/or any of its Subsidiaries) or would conflict with the fiduciary and/or statutory duties of such Subsidiary’s directors (or equivalent Persons), or (B) would result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management or consultant of such Subsidiary, an amount equal to the portion of such Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor; provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Applicable Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, the applicable organizational document or agreement or the applicable other impediment, an amount equal to such amount of Applicable Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant or (ii) to the extent that the Parent Guarantor has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Applicable Proceeds of any Non-Guarantor Disposition could have a material adverse tax or cost consequence with respect to such Applicable Proceeds (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Parent Guarantor, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and/or their equityholders would incur a tax liability, including as a result of a tax dividend, a deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax), the Applicable Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor and an amount equal to such Applicable Proceeds will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a ----- Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. Any Applicable Proceeds (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph in excess of the Excess Proceeds Threshold (as defined herein) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders and any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second preceding paragraph that are not accepted shall be deemed to be Declined Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of such Applicable Proceeds exceeds the greater of (i) $230.0 million and (ii) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to $1,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Applicable Proceeds by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Applicable Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion). Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Sale Offer using Applicable Proceeds at any time after the consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. ----- The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries becomes a party may contain, restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",,as_expected,2024,190,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The Indenture will provide that the Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including, but not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, with respect to any Asset Sale in excess of the greater of (x) $115.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75.0% of the consideration for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the Parent Guarantor\u2019s or such Restricted Subsidiary\u2019s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Parent Guarantor\u2019s or such Restricted Subsidiary\u2019s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the Parent Guarantor) of the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes (other than intercompany liabilities owing to a Restricted Subsidiary being disposed of), that are (i) assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities or (ii) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction; (b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Parent Guarantor acting in good faith to be converted by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received or expected to be received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and ----- (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $200.0 million and (ii) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of any non-cash consideration converted into Cash Equivalents) at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (or, at the Issuer\u2019s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. ----- The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer\u2019s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries becomes a party may contain, restrictions on the Issuer\u2019s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer\u2019s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30.0% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided that no such declaration may be made with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such declaration. Any notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written ----- representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC’s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. ----- Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (or any agent) shall not be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall not have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a non-consenting Holder). In the event of any Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will not be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided, to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least 30.0% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered, and if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; ----- (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Required Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to a responsible officer of the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.” Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default giving rise to such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may (x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.",,as_expected,2024,190,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d: (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under \u201c\u2014Reports and Other Information\u201d) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary);

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30.0% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided that no such declaration may be made with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such declaration. Any notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section (a \u201cNoteholder Direction\u201d) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each, a \u201cDirecting Holder\u201d) must be accompanied by a written ----- representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or DTC\u2019s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a \u201cPosition Representation\u201d), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder\u2019s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a \u201cVerification Covenant\u201d). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or DTC\u2019s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC\u2019s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor provides to the Trustee an Officer\u2019s Certificate certifying that the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer\u2019s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer\u2019s Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder\u2019s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder\u2019s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer\u2019s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer\u2019s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. ----- Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (or any agent) shall not be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer\u2019s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall not have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a non-consenting Holder). In the event of any Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will not be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided, to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; (2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least 30.0% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered, and if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; ----- (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Required Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to a responsible officer of the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a \u201cNotice of Default.\u201d Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default giving rise to such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may (x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The issuer and the Trustee take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the ----- Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the issuer has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or ----- (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the issuer. Neither the issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants.

If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated. The offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The issuer and the guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The respective initial purchasers propose to resell the respective notes at the offering prices set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum within the United States to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. See “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.” The price at which the notes are offered may be changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates. The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, with respect to the notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until 40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. We have agreed that, for a period of 45 days from the date of this offering memorandum, we will not, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by us. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC in its sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice. The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. The issuer does not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue any market making activities with respect to the notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the notes. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market. Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases. Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market ----- after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They may also cause the price of the notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time. The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, corporate advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory services for us and our affiliates from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Furthermore, certain of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may, from time to time, enter into armslength transactions with us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of their business. Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are agents, arrangers and/or lenders under senior revolving credit facilities and the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and, in each case, they have received, or they will be entitled to receive, customary fees and reimbursement of certain expenses in connection therewith, as applicable, and will receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering in connection with the Refinancing Transactions. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be holders of the 2026 Notes, which are being redeemed with the proceeds of this offering, and as a result, such initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may therefore receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge, and certain other of the initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical such hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby.

Following the UK’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the UK, including the Insolvency Regulation 2000 and EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (as amended) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (as amended) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”). Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligor would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. ----- However, to the extent that the English Obligor has its center of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the EU, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor that has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. Should the English Obligor have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court). Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings” below).

440,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2650,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,2650.1,England and Wales,2650.1.4,Administration,"English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of any company within their general jurisdiction (see “Insolvency law” above), any company incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or an EEA State (being any state that is a Contracting Party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area signed at Oporto on May 2, 1992 as adjusted by the Protocol signed at Brussels on March 17, 1993), any company (irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark) and upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries and territories. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is ----- satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration, which must be one of the statutory objectives (described below). An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the person making the appointment. To constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provisions apply to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator in respect of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The holder of the qualifying floating charge may appoint an administrator if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. It is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the primary objective); (2) the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) (the secondary objective); or (3) the realization of some or all of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (the tertiary objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless he thinks either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. Therefore, the administrator cannot pursue the tertiary objective unless he thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the primary objective or the secondary objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the tertiary objective. An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring- fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “Priority on Insolvency” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, ----- a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (“FCARs”). If the English Obligor were to enter administration, a demand for payment could be made under the guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against it in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is ----- satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become \u201cunable to pay its debts\u201d and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration, which must be one of the statutory objectives (described below). An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the person making the appointment. To constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provisions apply to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator in respect of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The holder of the qualifying floating charge may appoint an administrator if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. It is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to \u2018the whole or substantially the whole\u2019 of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company\u2019s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the primary objective); (2) the achievement of a better result for the company\u2019s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) (the secondary objective); or (3) the realization of some or all of the company\u2019s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (the tertiary objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless he thinks either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company\u2019s creditors as a whole. Therefore, the administrator cannot pursue the tertiary objective unless he thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the primary objective or the secondary objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the tertiary objective. An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring- fencing of the Prescribed Part (see \u201cPriority on Insolvency\u201d below).

At the end of the liquidation process the company will normally be dissolved. Liquidation proceedings may be opened where: (i) the company is registered in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) the debtor’s COMI is in the UK; or (iii) the debtor’s COMI is in an EU member state and there is an establishment in the UK. The English courts can also open compulsory liquidation (see below) in respect of foreign companies as unregistered companies if such foreign company has a sufficient connection to England and Wales and (A) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up order and (B) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the courts can exercise jurisdiction. There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). The difference between the two voluntary liquidation proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company must swear a statutory declaration that the company will be able to pay its debts in full, together with any applicable interest, within a period not exceeding 12 months from the commencement of the winding up. In comparison, the primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts. Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see “Insolvency Law” above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property, any transfer of the company’s shares, and any altering of the status of company members, made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the FCARs and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). ----- A liquidator has the power, among other things, to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “Avoidance of Transactions” below). Under English insolvency law, a liquidator also has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving a prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company which is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it imposes continuing financial obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous, or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in the winding-up.",,as_expected,2024,190,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Liquidation/winding-up\nText: Liquidation is an asset realization and distribution procedure under which the assets of the company (to the extent that they are not subject to any fixed security interest) are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act, with any surplus paid to the shareholders.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part, distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual setoff, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies). An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020) (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court grants an order on the application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors. ----- The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended)), as set out below. The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is_ less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest only; _Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the_ subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority premoratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday, save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid; _Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of_ priority in which expenses are paid); _Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._ Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and include: (a) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that such claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; _Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part only, unless the_ cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors; _Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security.

440,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2650,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,2650.4,"thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and",2650.4.2,Avoidance of transactions,"There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it. The issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a guarantee in respect of the notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question. ----- In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the initial administration. _Connected persons_ If a given transaction at an undervalue or preference has been entered into by the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below). A connected person, for these purposes, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such director or shadow director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company and for these purposes any director or other officer of a company is to be treated as employed by that company. A person is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of any individual with whom he is in partnership. In certain circumstances a person in his capacity as trustee may be an associate of a person that is a beneficiary, or an associate of the beneficiary. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees: _Transactions at an undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a guarantee (or grant other relief) if they believe that the creation of such guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the company was insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings. ----- In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any guarantees, although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order by the court may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) except where that person was a party to the transaction or the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Preferences_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside payments or the creation of a guarantee (or grant other relief) where such payment or guarantee constituted a preference. A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company’s insolvency is within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company grants the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which entered into the transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position in relation to that person when taking their decision. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. ----- _Transactions defrauding creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant company voluntary arrangement or, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside such transaction. There is no time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the transaction, or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transaction_ An administrator or a liquidator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g., assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).",,as_expected,2024,190,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Avoidance of transactions\nText: There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged.

Unlike a scheme of arrangement, a “cross-class cram-down” power is available in a restructuring plan that can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company). Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its debts within the meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes) will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention.

As with a scheme, it is for the proponent to determine whether the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class composition test applies.

Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Obligor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable”. Guarantees granted by the English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Amendments_ An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety. _Enforcement_ Enforcement of guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including guarantees). ----- _Moratoria_ The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Parent Guarantor is likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). ----- Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). _Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_ Further recent changes to the Insolvency Act have introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act). -----",,as_expected,2024,190,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Limitations on enforcement\nText: _Constitutional documents, corporate benefit and financial assistance_ The grant of a guarantee by any of the English Obligor in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company\u2019s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee can be found to be void and the respective creditor\u2019s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Obligor by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors\u2019 duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with \u201clikely\u201d in this context meaning \u201cprobable\u201d. Guarantees granted by the English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Amendments_ An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety. _Enforcement_ Enforcement of guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the legality, validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including guarantees). ----- _Moratoria_ The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue options. Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least \u00a310 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders otherwise). The Parent Guarantor is likely to fall outside the scope of being \u201celigible companies\u201d for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an \u201celigible company\u201d may also change from time to time. Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium. Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern. A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements) entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he or she will be compelled to end the moratorium. During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company, including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The Act includes a carve-out for enforcement of security financial collateral or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed. Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver). ----- Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company\u2019s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of \u00a35,000 or 1% of the company\u2019s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course. A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available: - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than 50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right to vote; - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit; - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented, accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and - at the court\u2019s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan). _Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_ Further recent changes to the Insolvency Act have introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty\u2019s entry into a \u2018relevant insolvency procedure\u2019 (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act). -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain). The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and restructuring plans will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the UK’s pending accession to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties (the one English case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter position). _Recognition in the EU_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs, a small number of EU member states have adopted the Model Law which will likely assist recognition of an English process in such jurisdictions. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in Member States. ----- As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU.
