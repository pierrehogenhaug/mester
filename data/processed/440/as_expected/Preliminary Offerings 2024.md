**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **CONFIDENTIAL**

# GATES CORPORATION


## $500,000,000  % Senior Notes due 2029

Gates Corporation (the “issuer”) is offering $500,000,000 of its   % senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”).
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on hand, in connection with the Refinancing Transactions (as defined
herein).


The notes will bear interest at a rate of   % per annum. We will pay interest on the notes semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on May   and
November   of each year, beginning on November  , 2024. Interest on the notes offered hereby will accrue from       , 2024. The notes will
mature on May  , 2029.

At any time prior to May  , 2026, the issuer may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the notes to be redeemed, plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At
any time on or after May  , 2026, the issuer may redeem some or all of the notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to May  , 2026, the issuer
may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings
at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See
“Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” If we sell certain of our assets or experience specific kinds of changes of control, subject to certain
exceptions, the issuer must offer to purchase all of the notes at the prices set forth in this offering memorandum plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase.

Obligations under the notes will be guaranteed by Gates Industrial Holdco Limited (the “Parent Guarantor”), an indirect parent company of the
issuer and the direct subsidiary of Gates Industrial Corporation plc, and each of the Parent Guarantor’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic
restricted subsidiaries (other than the issuer) that guarantee our senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness of the issuer or the
guarantors. The notes and the guarantees will be the issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and rank equally and ratably with all
existing and future senior indebtedness, senior to any future subordinated indebtedness, effectively subordinated in right of payment to any future
secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to the obligations of any
subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor that is not the issuer or subsidiary guarantor of the notes.


**Investing in the notes involves risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18.**


**Price for the notes:   % plus accrued interest from        , 2024.**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the securities
laws of any other jurisdiction. Unless they are registered, the notes may be offered only in transactions that are exempt from registration under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, we are offering the notes only (a) to persons reasonably believed to be
“qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and (b) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance
with Regulation S of the Securities Act. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see “Notice to Investors; Transfer
Restrictions.”

Currently, there is no public market for the notes. We do not intend to apply for listing of the notes on any security exchange or for inclusion of
the notes in any automated quotation system.


The initial purchasers expect to deliver the notes to investors only in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company
on or about        , 2024.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

**England & Wales**

The Parent Guarantor is incorporated as a private limited company under the laws of England and Wales.
The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. This is in contrast to arbitral awards,
which are often easier to enforce under the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of
Foreign Arbitral awards, to which the UK is a signatory. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by
any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In order to
enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before a court of
competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate
the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be
possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Summary
judgment is a procedure by which the English court can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full
trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action may be conditional
upon (among other things) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of
laws principles and rules of English private international law (in other words, it does not matter that the
U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according
to the rules of English private international law);

    - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive in the court which pronounced it (which includes a
judgment that may be open to review by the same court, or open to appeal);

    - the U.S. judgment being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

    - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or
the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable);

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or
in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or
revenue law. A U.S. injunction, for example, cannot be enforced by an English court;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud, duress, undue influence or any bribe or corrupt
conduct, or in breach of English principles of natural justice (meaning, for example, that the defendant
had due notice and an opportunity to be heard);

    - the U.S. judgment remaining valid and enforceable in the court in which it was obtained;

    - the U.S. judgment not being inconsistent with a prior judgment on the same subject matter between the
same parties;


-----

    - the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in the U.S.;

    - the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English court;
and

    - the application to enforce the U.S. judgment being made in the English courts by the person in whom
the rights are vested under the judgment within the relevant period applicable under English law
(including English rules on conflict of laws).

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition, it is questionable whether an
English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in England and
Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Further,
it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor
is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or counterclaim against
the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any
counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales unless the
subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.

**Submission to jurisdiction**

With respect to actions arising out of or in connection with the indenture governing the notes, the issuer and
the guarantors, including the Parent Guarantor, have submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New
York sitting in the County of New York in New York City, or courts of the United States for the Southern District of
New York.

**MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

This offering memorandum includes and incorporates by reference market and industry data and forecasts
that we have derived from independent consultant reports, publicly available information, various industry
publications, other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates. Independent consultant reports,
industry publications and other published industry sources generally indicate that the information contained therein
was obtained from sources believed to be reliable.

Although we believe that these third-party sources are reliable, we do not guarantee the accuracy or
completeness of this information, and neither we nor the initial purchasers have independently verified this
information. Some market data and statistical information are also based on our good faith estimates, which are
derived from management’s knowledge of our industry and such independent sources referred to above. Certain
market, ranking and industry data included elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum,
including the size of certain markets and our size or position and the positions of our competitors within these
markets, including our services relative to our competitors, are based on estimates of our management. These
estimates have been derived from our management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate,
as well as information obtained from surveys, reports by market research firms, our customers, distributors,
suppliers, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which we operate and have not been
verified by independent sources. Unless otherwise noted, all of our market share and market position information
presented in this offering memorandum or incorporated by reference is an approximation. Our market share and
market position in each of our businesses, unless otherwise noted, is based on our sales relative to the estimated
sales in the markets we serve. References herein to our being a leader in a market or product category refer to our
belief that we have a leading market share position in each specified market, unless the context otherwise requires.
As there are no publicly available sources supporting this belief, it is based solely on our internal analysis of our
sales as compared to our estimates of sales of our competitors. In addition, the discussion herein regarding our
various end markets is based on how we define the end markets for our products, which products may be either part
of larger overall end markets or end markets that include other types of products and services.

Solely for convenience, the trademarks, service marks and trade names referred to in this offering
memorandum are without the [®] and [™] symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we
will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights to these trademarks, service marks and trade

their respective owners.

Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to (i) “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” refer to Gates
Industrial Corporation plc and its subsidiaries, (ii) “Gates” refer to Gates Industrial Corporation plc only, (iii) the
“issuer” refers to Gates Corporation, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor (iv) the “Parent

offered hereby, the amended revolving credit facility, or the new term loans.

This offering memorandum includes or incorporates by reference the historical consolidated financial
statements and other financial data of the Company in lieu of consolidated financial statements and other financial
data of the Parent Guarantor. Gates has no operations of its own, and the only significant difference between the
results of operations and net assets that would be shown in the consolidated financial statements of the Parent
Guarantor and those for the Company are (i) additional net intercompany loan payables due to Gates Industrial
Holdco and its subsidiaries from Gates, which were $412.0 million and $333.6 million as of March 30, 2024 and
December 30, 2023, respectively, (ii) additional intercompany payables due to Gates Industrial Holdco and its
subsidiaries from Gates attributable to UK tax group relief of $19.5 million and $26.6 million as of March 30, 2024
and December 30, 2023, respectively and (iii) additional cash and cash equivalents held by Gates, which cash and
cash equivalents were $15.7 million and $3.5 million as of March 30, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.

certain tables or charts may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed
as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic
aggregation of the percentages that precede them.

All amounts in this offering memorandum and the documents incorporated by reference herein are
expressed in United States of America (the “U.S.”) dollars, unless indicated otherwise.

**NO REVIEW BY THE SEC; NO REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

This offering memorandum will not be reviewed by the SEC. There are no registration rights associated
with the notes or the guarantees and we have no present intention to offer to exchange the notes and the guarantees


-----

for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act or to file a registration statement with respect to the
notes. The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”).

**NON-GAAP METRICS**

We assess the performance of our businesses using a variety of measures. Certain of these measures are not
explicitly defined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and are
therefore termed Non-GAAP measures. Under “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial
Information” we identify and explain the relevance of these Non-GAAP measures referenced herein, show how they
are calculated and present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable measure defined under GAAP. We do not
regard these Non-GAAP measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures defined under GAAP.
The Non-GAAP measures that we use may not be directly comparable with similarly-titled measures used by other
companies.

**ALTERNATIVE SETTLEMENT CYCLE**

It is expected that delivery of the securities will be made against payment therefor on or about
the      business day following the date of confirmation of orders with respect to the securities (this settlement
cycle being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days (or, for trades in the secondary market occurring on or after May
28, 2024, one business day), unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers
who wish to trade the securities prior to one business day before the securities are delivered will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the securities initially will settle in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the
time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisors.

**Company Overview**

We are a global manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power
solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original
equipment manufacturers (“first-fit”) as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from
replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, including: automotive
replacement and first-fit; diversified industrial; industrial off-highway, industrial on-highway, and personal mobility.
Our net sales have historically been, and remain, highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not
with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. We
sell our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers,
installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built
over more than 110 years since Gates’ founding in 1911.

Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are often critical components in
applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness
of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to
normal wear and tear, resulting in natural, and often preventative, replacement cycles that drive high-margin,
recurring revenue. Our product portfolio represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid
power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified group of
well-known customers throughout the world. As a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of highly
engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of our end markets and the
regions in which we operate.

During the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023”), we generated $3,570.2 million in net
sales, our net income was $257.0 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $747.0 million, representing an Adjusted
EBITDA margin of 20.9%. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”), we generated $3,554.2
million in net sales, our net income was $242.9 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $680.6 million, representing
an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.1%. During the three months ended March 30, 2024, our net sales were $862.6
million compared to $897.7 million for the three months ended April 1, 2023, our net income from continuing
operations was $46.2 million for the three months ended March 30, 2024 compared to $30.9 million in the prior year
period, and our Adjusted EBITDA was $195.6 million, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.7%,
compared to $174.5 million in the prior year period, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.4%. For a
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in
accordance with GAAP, see “—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information.” Gates’ business is wellbalanced and diversified across products, channels and geographies, as highlighted in the following charts showing
breakdowns of our Fiscal 2023 net sales of $3,570.2 million.

**Our Solutions**

We operate our business on a product-line basis through our two reporting segments - Power Transmission
and Fluid Power. See Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, incorporated by reference in this report, for additional
information.

We sell our products under the Gates brand in all of the geographies and end markets we serve, as well as
under select customer brands in certain markets. Our power transmission segment includes elastomer drive belts and
related components used to efficiently transfer power in a broad range of applications. Power transmission products
represented approximately 61% of our total net sales for Fiscal 2023. Our fluid power segment includes hoses,
tubing and fittings designed to convey hydraulic fluid at high pressures in both mobile and stationary applications,
and other high-pressure and fluid transfer hoses. Our fluid power products represented approximately 39% of our net
sales for Fiscal 2023.

Our power transmission and fluid power products are often critical to the functioning of the equipment,
process or system in which they are components, such that the cost of downtime or potential equipment damage is
high relative to the cost of our products. Our products are therefore replaced not only as a result of normal wear and
tear, but also preemptively as part of ongoing, normal maintenance to the broader system.

We have a broad portfolio of both power transmission and fluid power products in the end markets we
serve and are a global leader in power transmission and a top three player in fluid power. We have a long history of
focusing on customer engagement and training, driving product innovation and providing best-in-class order
fulfillment services.


-----

We participate in many sectors of the industrial and consumer markets. We believe the large, diverse and
global nature of the markets we serve provides attractive opportunities for profitable growth. Based on market
research data, as well as our own analysis, we believe that we have a total core addressable market opportunity of
approximately $70 billion. Of this approximately $70 billion, we believe power transmission accounts for
approximately $40 billion and fluid power accounts for approximately $30 billion.

**_Power Transmission. Our power transmission solutions transfer power, convey materials and provide_**
motion control. They are used in applications in which belts, chains, cables, geared transmissions or direct drives
transfer power from an engine motor or other source of mechanical power to another part or system. Our belts are
made of highly engineered polymer formulations, fabrics or textiles (made from a variety of polymer or natural
fibers) and embedded cords for reinforcement (which may be made from polymers such as polyesters or aramids,
fiberglass or high performance carbon fibers). Many of these materials are proprietary to Gates. Within our power
transmission segment, we offer solutions across the following key application platforms:

    - _Stationary drives: fixed drive systems such as those used in a factory driving a machine or pump, on a_
grain elevator driving the lift auger or in a distribution center driving automated equipment such as
conveyor lines or robotic picking machines;

    - _Mobile drives: drives on a piece of mobile machinery such as the threshing and separation drives on a_
combine harvester;

    - _Engine systems: synchronous drives and related components for cam shaft drives, auxiliary drives and_
asynchronous accessory drives for air conditioning (“A/C”) compressors, power steering, alternators
and starter/generator systems; and

    - _Personal mobility: drives on motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, both traditional and electric, as well as on_
snowmobiles and other power sports vehicles that are used to transfer power between the power source
and the drive wheel(s) or track.

Customers choose power transmission solutions based on a number of factors, including application
requirements such as load, speed, gear ratio, temperature, operating environment, ease of maintenance, noise,
efficiency and reliability, as well as the support they receive from their suppliers, including application-specific
engineering services. Belt-based drive systems have many advantages over other alternatives, as they are typically
clean, low-maintenance, lubrication-free, quiet with low-vibration, lightweight, compact, energy-efficient, durable
and reliable.

Belt-based power transmission drives typically consist of either a synchronous belt (such as a timing belt)
or an asynchronous belt (such as a V-belt, continuously-variable transmission (“CVT”) belt or Micro-V® belt) and
related components (sprockets, pulleys, mechanical water pumps, tensioners or other accessories). In addition, we
also manufacture metal drive components and assemble certain product kits for the automotive replacement channel.

_Asynchronous Belts. Asynchronous belts are our highest-volume products and are used in a broad range of_
applications. We were a pioneer in the design and manufacturing of V-belts, which draw their name from the shape
of their profile. We also manufacture “ribbed” V-belts, which are belts with lengthwise V-shaped grooves, which we
market under the Micro-V[®] name. This design results in a thinner belt for the same drive surface, making it more
flexible and offering improved efficiency.

In industrial end markets, asynchronous belts have a wide variety of applications, including use in pump
drives, manufacturing lines, HVAC systems, industrial, truck, bus and marine engines, forestry and mining
equipment and many other applications. CVT systems often found in scooters, power sports vehicles and other
applications use a specialized V-belt known as a CVT belt. In automotive applications, our asynchronous belts
perform functions that include transferring power from the crankshaft to accessory drive components such as the
alternator, A/C compressor, power steering system, water pump and, in some vehicles, a belt/starter generator
system used in start/stop accessory drive systems to improve fuel economy.


-----

Recently, Gates introduced a new Micro-V[®] platform for engine accessory drive systems. The combination
of newly developed material compounds and product design utilizes less material, reduces belt weight and results in
lower bending stiffness. These improvements enable tighter pulley configurations and reduced drive bending losses
as compared to previous belt technologies; lower losses result in benefits such as reduced energy consumption,
CO2 emissions and heat generation.

_Synchronous Belts. Synchronous belts, also known as timing belts, are non-slipping mechanical drive belts._
They have molded teeth and run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. Synchronous belts experience no
slippage and are often used to transfer high levels of power or to control motion for indexing or timing purposes, as
well as for linear positioning and positive drive conveying. They are typically used instead of chains or gears and we
believe they have a number of advantages over these alternatives, including less noise, no need for lubrication,
improved durability and performance and a more compact design.

Examples of industrial applications include use in HVAC systems, food processing and bottling plants,
mining and agricultural equipment, automated doors, warehouse systems and robotics. Our synchronous belts are
also utilized in personal mobility vehicles, including both traditional and electric motorcycles, bicycles and scooters,
applications in which clean, quiet performance is often valued. In automotive applications, our synchronous belts are
used to synchronize the rotation of the engine crankshaft with the camshaft in a valve train system, as well as in
electric power steering, parking brake and accessory drive systems which are present in internal-combustion, hybrid
and electric vehicles.

In recent years, Gates also launched the PowerGrip[®] GT[®]4 a high-torque synchronous belt for industrial
applications. This new belt leverages Gates’ materials science and process engineering capabilities, to provide a belt
construction that replaces chloroprene-based elastomers with an advanced ethylene elastomer formulation that is
more environmentally friendly. It has the highest power-carrying capacity in its segment, a wider operating
temperature range and increased chemical resistance, allowing for narrower drives and a broad range of applications
to be served with both first-fit and replacement channel customers.

In recent years, Gates launched the Carbon Drive CDC[®] synchronous belt designed for commuter bicycle
applications and in Fiscal 2022 Gates launched the Carbon Drive Moto X5 synchronous belt designed specifically
for mid-motor, sit-down electric scooters and motorcycles typically found in commuting applications in the rapidly
evolving Asian market. In Fiscal 2022, Gates launched an updated version of Gates Design Power, an award-wining
new digital toolkit consisting of six modules, including four all-new applications and substantially upgraded
versions of well-known Gates digital tools, Design IQ™ and Design Flex Pro™. Among the all-new programs is the
industry-first Mobility Drive Analysis tool aimed at making it easier for engineers from bicycle, scooter,
motorcycle, and power sports Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) to design Gates’ clean, quiet, durable
and low-maintenance Carbon Drive belt systems into their next-generation vehicles to further accelerating
conversion from chain and other technologies. In Fiscal 2023, Gates announced the launch of the mobile version of
Gates Design Power, putting advanced digital design tools to support the engineering of belt drive systems on
customers’ mobile devices. Additionally, Gates expanded its G-Force product portfolio by introducing the G-Force
Workhorse CVT belt for specialty and recreation vehicles. The G-Force Workhorse belt offers more longevity and
increased compatibility for end users relative to its predecessor.

_Metal Drive Components. We source, manufacture and sell tensioners, idlers, pulleys, sprockets and other_
components used in belt drive systems. These products are designed and engineered to work efficiently with our
belts. Tensioners are devices that maintain a constant tension in the belt drive system, thereby ensuring proper
function and preventing loss of power or system failure. Tensioners typically employ a spring-loaded arm and a
damping mechanism to help control tension in a belt drive system. Idlers, which sometimes also perform as
tensioners, are used to take up extra belt length. Gates’ pulleys and sprockets are precisely engineered for positive
press fit, designed to optimize the performance and durable working service life of the belt drive system.

_Kits. Our kits for the automotive replacement channel include all of the parts needed by an automotive_
service shop to perform a replacement of one of our products. Kits are created for specific vehicle makes and models
and typically include belts, tensioners and idlers, and will sometimes also include water pumps, which are often
replaced simultaneously with a timing belt due to the relatively high labor component in the total cost of a typical
replacement. Our kits are convenient for service technicians as they eliminate the need for more complicated product


-----

sourcing. On a comparable quantity basis, kits typically sell at a premium to a loose belt and the individual related
components.

Our power transmission products are used in a broad range of applications in end markets including:
automotive replacement and first-fit, diversified industrial, industrial off-highway, industrial on-highway, energy
and resources, and personal mobility. The majority of our Fiscal 2023 net sales came from replacement channels,
which provide high-margin, recurring revenue streams and are driven by attractive market trends. The bulk of our
power transmission replacement business resides in developed regions, in which a large, aging installed base of
equipment follows a natural maintenance cycle and is served by well-established distribution channels. For example,
a combine harvester can have over 25 high-performance belts that are typically replaced at regular intervals,
depending on wear and tear, with end users having access to replacement parts through a large network of
distributors. Similarly, in the mature automotive aftermarkets such as North America and Europe, maintenance
intervals are well defined, and miles (or kilometers) driven per vehicle and the average vehicle age have generally
been increasing, leading to more wear and tear on vehicles. A smaller portion of our power transmission
replacement business is generated in emerging markets, which generally have a smaller base of installed equipment
and relatively nascent distribution channels. As they continue to develop, these replacement channels in emerging
markets represent a significant long-term opportunity for growth.

In addition to our power transmission replacement business, we also serve a wide variety of well-known
first-fit customers across all of our end markets.

**_Fluid Power. Our fluid power solutions are used in applications in which hoses and rigid tubing assemblies_**
either transfer power hydraulically or convey fluids, gases or granular materials from one location to another. Within
our fluid power segment, we offer solutions across the following key application platforms:

    - _Stationary hydraulics: applications within stationary machinery, such as an injection molding machine_
or a manufacturing press;

    - _Mobile hydraulics: applications used to power various implements in mobile equipment used in_
construction, agriculture, mining and other heavy industries;

    - _Vehicle systems: applications in thermal management, emissions reduction, turbocharger, air intake_
and other systems for electric, hybrid and internal combustion passenger and commercial vehicles; and

    - _Other industrial: applications in which hoses are used to convey fluids, gases or granular material_
across several industries such as food and beverage, other process industries, and oil and gas drilling
and refining.

Customers choose fluid power solutions based on a number of factors, including application-specific
product performance parameters such as pressure and temperature ratings, corrosion and leak resistance, weight,
flexibility, abrasion resistance and cleanliness, as well as compliance with standards and product availability.
Attributes associated with the supplier, including brand, global footprint and reputation for reliability, quality and
service, are also considered.

_Hydraulics. Our hydraulics product line is comprised of hoses, couplings, tubing and fittings, offered either_
as standalone products or completed assemblies. Our hydraulic products are key components of hydraulic systems in
both stationary and mobile equipment applications across end-markets such as construction, agricultural and forestry
equipment, as well as in a wide range of manufacturing applications. We provide a full selection of hose sizes and
construction types for use in a wide variety of operating requirements and conditions. Hydraulic hoses are made of
elastomers reinforced with steel wire or a textile-based yarn, and typically operate at very high pressures, often in
extreme environmental conditions. These products are designed for applications that require high levels of quality
and durability.

Our hydraulic couplings, fittings and tubing are engineered to match the product performance of our
hydraulic hoses. The high-pressure nature of hydraulic systems requires that these products have high levels of


-----

performance similar to those found in our hydraulic hoses. The ultimate performance of a hydraulic assembly, in
which our products function as part of a hydraulic circuit, depends not only on how well the components are made,
but also on how well they complement each other. Our hydraulic fittings are manufactured in a wide assortment of
sizes and configurations to ensure we meet the wide range of installation requirements in these systems. We also
provide Gates-engineered and third-party crimping systems to ensure a proper interface is obtained between our
hoses and these metal components to create high-quality, robust hydraulic assemblies.

In recent years, Gates introduced a new premium product family consisting of hydraulic hoses that are
lighter weight and more flexible. Made with a high-performance reinforcement and robust, abrasion-resistant cover,
the MXT line of hydraulic hose is comprised of universally applicable, high-performance products that meet the
needs of a wide range of applications. Subsequently, we launched the MXG line of hydraulic hose, a flexible, lightweight solution with increased durability and temperature performance, designed to replace conventional spiral
hoses typically used in the most demanding applications. We also launched a smart e-crimper, which is a machine
used to attach fittings to hydraulic hoses. In addition to convenient, web-enabled access to training content and
product crimp specs, this new crimper can be used with Gates’ intuitive mobile eCrimp app. In Fiscal 2022, we
launched the ProV hose family in Europe, which is an addition to our Pro Series product portfolio that leverages
technologies developed and first launched in our MXT and MXG product lines.

_Thermal and Emissions Management. Our thermal and emissions management and related products_
perform a variety of fluid conveyance, emissions reduction and efficiency improvement functions in electric, hybrid
and internal combustion passenger and commercial vehicles. In electric applications, Gates offers hose and electric
water pump solutions for the thermal management system regulating the battery, inverter, motor(s) and passenger
compartment. In internal combustion applications, Gates primarily provides thermal management hose and water
pumps for engine cooling, selective catalytic reduction hoses that are part of systems that reduce harmful emissions
from diesel engines and hoses for functions that improve air intake and engine efficiency. In Fiscal 2021, we
launched a new line of ThermalPro electric water pumps for OEM and aftermarket applications, broadening Gates
presence in hybrid and battery electric vehicle as well as other thermal management applications like data center
cooling.

_Industrial Hose. Our industrial hoses are used to transfer a wide range of substances - chemicals, food,_
beverages, petroleum, fuels, bulk materials, water, steam and air - to meet the requirements of a diverse range of
applications, including manufacturing, mining, oil and gas drilling, marine, agriculture, industrial cleaning and
construction. Our application engineering teams work with customers to assist them in selecting the appropriate hose
solution to safely meet their operational needs. We leverage our materials science expertise to design hoses that
perform at varying pressures and levels of resistance to chemicals, oil, abrasion, ozone, flame and both hot and cold
temperatures. For performance in extreme environments, many of our industrial hoses feature both crush-resistant
and flexible designs. Gates industrial hoses are highly engineered to meet or exceed a multitude of industry
standards and certifications, and are offered in a range of diameters, lengths and colors to allow customers to
differentiate the hoses in applications. We also offer a wide range of couplings to provide complete assembly
solutions.

Our fluid power products are used in numerous applications in end markets including automotive
replacement and first-fit; diversified industrial; industrial off-highway; industrial on-highway; energy and resources;
and personal mobility. The largest portion of our Fiscal 2023 fluid power revenue came from replacement markets.
Within these replacement markets, the majority of our revenue came from industrial applications.

(1) “EBITDA” is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income or loss from continuing operations for the period before the impact of
income taxes, net interest and other expenses, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is widely used by securities analysts, investors and
other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by
variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to
relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets
are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense).

Management uses “Adjusted EBITDA” as its key profitability measure. This is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA before
certain items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses on a period-over-period basis or with other
businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our measure of segment profitability to assess the performance of our businesses, and it is used for
total Gates as well because we believe it is important to consider our profitability on a basis that is consistent with that of our operating
segments, as well as that of certain of our peer companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA should, therefore, be made available to
securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the performance of our businesses.

During the periods presented, the items excluded from EBITDA in computing Adjusted EBITDA primarily included:

     - non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation;

     - transaction-related expenses incurred in relation to major corporate transactions, including the acquisition of businesses, and
equity and debt transactions;

     - asset impairments;

     - restructuring expenses, including severance related expenses;

     - credit loss related to a customer bankruptcy;

     - cybersecurity incident expenses and

     - inventory adjustments related to certain inventories accounted for on the LIFO basis.

Differences exist among our businesses and from period to period in the extent to which their respective employees receive share-based
compensation or a charge for such compensation is recognized. We therefore exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the non-cash charges in
relation to share-based compensation in order to assess the relative performance of our businesses.

We exclude from Adjusted EBITDA acquisition-related costs that are required to be expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We also
exclude costs associated with major corporate transactions because we do not believe that they relate to our performance. Other items are
excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because they are individually or collectively significant items that are not considered to be representative
of the underlying performance of our businesses. During the periods presented, we excluded restructuring expenses and severance-related
expenses that reflect specific, strategic actions taken by management to shutdown, downsize, or otherwise fundamentally reorganize areas
of Gates’ business, and changes in the LIFO inventory reserve recognized in cost of sales for certain inventories that are valued on a LIFO
basis. During inflationary or deflationary pricing environments, LIFO adjustments can result in variability of the cost of sales recognized
each period as the most recent costs are matched against current sales, while historical, typically lower, costs are retained in inventory.
LIFO adjustments are determined based on published pricing indices, which often are not representative of the actual cost changes or timing
of those changes as experienced by our business. Excluding the impact from the application of LIFO therefore improves the comparability


-----

of our financial performance from period to period and with the Company’s peers, and more closely represents the physical flow of our
inventory and how we manage the business.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore, be used in
conjunction with, not as substitutes for, profit or loss for the period. Management compensates for these limitations by separately
monitoring net income from continuing operations for the period.

Under the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, our
ability to engage in activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments and paying certain dividends is
governed, in part, by our ability to satisfy tests based on Covenant EBITDA.

EBITDA and Covenant EBITDA:

(c) On January 31, 2023, one of our customers filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. In connection with the bankruptcy proceedings, we evaluated our potential risk and exposure relating to our outstanding
pre-petition accounts receivable balance from the customer and recorded pre-tax charges to reflect our estimated recovery. We
continue to monitor the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy in determining whether adjustments to this recovery estimate
are necessary.

(d) On February 11, 2023, Gates determined that it was the target of a malware attack. Cybersecurity incident expenses include
legal, consulting, and other costs incurred as a direct result of this incident, some of which may be partially offset by insurance
recoveries.

(e) Under the terms of our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, we are
permitted to include adjustments for run-rate cost savings to reflect the run-rate savings associated with various cost reduction
and restructuring projects that either have been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. In the periods
presented, these projects related primarily to headcount reductions resulting from the right-sizing of our operations and the
streamlining of our corporate functions. These run-rate savings are limited to discrete, quantifiable savings and do not include
savings expected from a number of other cost-reduction and pricing initiatives that have been implemented or which are in the
process of being implemented, as those savings cannot be as definitively quantified on a routine basis. The inclusion of run-rate
cost savings are not projections and should not be viewed as a representation that we will in fact achieve the cost-savings in the
time frame set forth above or at all, but is rather presented to help investors evaluate the covenants contained in the credit

agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes because we will be permitted
to include these cost savings in calculating Adjusted EBITDA for the purposes of certain ratios in such documents.

(f) Other one-time adjustments represent unusual or non-trading items that we are permitted to adjust for under the terms of our
senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. We use
Adjusted EBITDA margin to measure the success of our businesses in managing our cost base and improving profitability.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described_
_below and all of the information contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, including_
_those described under “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our annual report incorporated by reference herein_
_before deciding whether to purchase the notes. Any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our_
_business, results of operations and financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only_
_risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we_
_currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_
_condition. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your original investment. The risks discussed below also_
_include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these_
_forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this offering_
_memorandum._

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**Our substantial leverage and subsidiary structure could adversely affect our financial condition, our**
**ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to**
**react to changes in the economy or our industry or our ability to pay our debts, and could divert our cash**
**flow from operations to debt payments.**

As of March 30, 2024, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, the total principal amount of our
debt would have been $2,366.4 million. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences,
including the following:

    - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;

    - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;

    - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of
other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

    - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of
interest;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;

    - placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and

    - increasing our cost of borrowing.

If we incur substantial additional debt, from time to time, the risks related to our high level of debt could
increase.

The Parent Guarantor and the Company are holding companies, and their consolidated assets are owned by,
and their business is conducted through, their subsidiaries, including the issuer. Earnings from subsidiaries are our
primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses. If our subsidiaries are restricted from making
distributions, our ability to meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations may be impaired.
Moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws,
including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to
shareholders only from profits. As a result, although a subsidiary of ours may have cash, we may not be able to


-----

obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our operations. See “Description of
Notes.”

**Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter**
**into other transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.**

We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future to finance working capital, capital
expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or for other purposes. Although certain of the agreements governing our
existing indebtedness (including the indenture that will govern the notes, and the credit agreements that govern our
senior secured credit facilities) contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into
certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions.
Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also
do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined
under our debt instruments. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks
described in the immediately preceding risk factor would increase.

**Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness**
**service obligations to increase significantly.**

While interest rates had remained at historically low levels in past years, the Federal Reserve Board
increased the federal funds rate in 2022 and 2023 and could increase rates in the future. As a result, interest rates on
our senior secured credit facilities or other variable rate debt could be higher or lower than current levels. As of
March 30, 2024, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions and after taking into account our interest rate
derivatives, $611.4 million (equivalent), or 25.8%, of our outstanding debt had variable interest rates. If interest
rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount
borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.

**We may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes.**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends
on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional
economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control, including the
availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. Lower revenues generally will reduce our
cash flow. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to
refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to
restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, which could cause us to default on our debt
obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of
the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business
operations.

Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to
declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The lenders
under our senior secured credit facilities could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making
further loans, and institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy
or liquidation. If we breach our covenants under our senior secured credit facilities, we would be in default
thereunder. The lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation.


-----

**The senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will**
**impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Parent Guarantor and its restricted**
**subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.**

The senior secured credit facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit the ability of the Parent Guarantor
and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

    - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

    - make certain investments;

    - incur certain liens;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - merge or consolidate;

    - enter into agreements that prohibit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other
payments to the issuer or the guarantors;

    - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the notes;
and

    - transfer or sell assets.

In addition, our senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain a maximum first lien net leverage
ratio if borrowings under our revolving credit facility exceed a certain threshold.

As a result of the restrictions described above, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and
we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new
business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail
to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our
indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in connection with the Refinancing Transactions, could result in an
event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before
their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these
borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**A decline in our operating results or available cash could cause us to experience difficulties in**
**complying with covenants contained in more than one agreement, which could result in our bankruptcy or**
**liquidation.**

If we were to sustain a decline in our operating results or available cash, we could experience difficulties in
complying with the financial covenants contained in the credit agreements that govern our senior secured credit
facilities. The failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the senior secured
credit facilities and by reason of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, other indebtedness may then become
immediately due and payable. In addition, should an event of default occur, the lenders under our senior secured
credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making loans and institute foreclosure


-----

proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance
declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our senior secured credit
facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our senior secured credit facilities and seek a
waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under
our senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be
forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the notes, is**
**dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our**
**control.**

Our subsidiaries own all of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our
indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and (if they are
not an issuer or guarantor of the notes) their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment
or otherwise.

Unless they are the issuer or guarantor of the notes, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay
amounts due on the notes or to make funds available to the issuer or the guarantor for that purpose. Our nonguarantor subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions or repay intercompany
loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the notes. Each non-guarantor
subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our
ability to obtain cash from our non-guarantor subsidiaries. While our senior secured credit facilities limit, and the
indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will limit, the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur
consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to the issuer or
guarantors, these limitations will be subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. The indenture that will govern
the notes offered hereby will not limit the ability of our non-guarantor unrestricted subsidiaries to incur any
additional consensual restrictions on their ability to make any such payments to the issuer or guarantors. Our nonguarantor unrestricted subsidiaries (if any) will be able to engage in many of the activities that the Parent Guarantor
and its restricted subsidiaries subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will be
prohibited or limited from doing under the terms of the indenture. These actions could be detrimental to our ability
to make payments of principal and interest under the notes when due and to comply with our other obligations under
the notes and could reduce the amount of our assets that would be available to satisfy your claims should we default
on the notes.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

**Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply to us if the notes are**
**rated investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P.**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will cease to apply to the notes during
such time, if any, as the notes are rated investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P, so long as at such time no event
of default has occurred and is continuing. Although there can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated
investment grade, or if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain these ratings, any suspension of
the covenants under the indenture that will govern the notes would allow us to engage in certain transactions that
would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent any suspended covenants are
subsequently reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of
default under the indenture that will govern the notes on the basis that such actions would have been prohibited by
the covenants. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a**
**result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely**
**affect our results of operations and our financial condition.**

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the
holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable


-----

immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under
our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance
or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, including our senior secured credit facilities, the holders of
such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or
declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of
our other debt instruments.

**Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of**
**our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes.**

The notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Only the Parent
Guarantor’s existing wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than the issuer) that guarantee
indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities and certain other indebtedness will initially guarantee the
notes. In the future, each of the Parent Guarantor’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantees
the senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness of the issuer or any guarantor will guarantee the
notes, subject to certain exceptions. Our existing and future foreign subsidiaries, non-wholly-owned domestic
restricted subsidiaries and unrestricted subsidiaries (if any) will not and are not expected to guarantee the notes, and
these subsidiaries do not and are not expected to guarantee our indebtedness under the senior secured credit
facilities. Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of these nonguarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and will not be satisfied from the assets of these non-guarantor
subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in full. For the twelve months ended March 30, 2024, before intercompany
eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 75% of our revenues and approximately
74% of our Adjusted EBITDA. As of March 30, 2024, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 68% of our total assets and approximately 65% of our total liabilities. As of
March 30, 2024, after adjusting for certain structural intercompany loan assets and liabilities that largely offset each
other, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 68% of our total assets and approximately 25% of
our total liabilities.

In addition, the guarantee of certain guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of such
guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes or upon certain other events
described in “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to
incur certain additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered
indebtedness thereunder.

**The notes are unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness to the**
**extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness.**

Our obligations under the notes will be unsecured and will be effectively subordinated to our secured
indebtedness, including the indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities, to the extent of the value of the
collateral securing such secured indebtedness. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities are secured by
substantially all of the assets of the issuer and any existing and future guarantors, including all of the capital stock of
the issuer and each wholly-owned restricted subsidiary directly owned by the issuer or any guarantor.

If an event of default occurs under the credit agreement that governs our senior secured credit facilities, the
holders of such senior secured indebtedness will have a prior right to our secured assets, to the exclusion of the
holders of the notes, even if we are in default with respect to the notes. In that event, our secured assets would first
be used to repay in full all indebtedness and other obligations secured by them (including all amounts outstanding
under the senior secured credit facilities), resulting in all or a portion of our assets being unavailable to satisfy the
claims of the holders of the notes and other unsecured indebtedness. Therefore, in the event of any distribution or
payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, or other bankruptcy
proceeding, holders of the notes will participate in our remaining assets ratably with each other and with all of the
holders of our other unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to be of the same class as the notes, and potentially with
all of our other general unsecured creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor. In
any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the


-----

notes. As a result, holders of the notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness. In addition,
the indenture that will govern the notes will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness, which could be
substantial.

**Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the indenture governing the notes by beneficial**
**owners, including those with short positions in excess of their interests in the notes, will be disregarded.**

By acceptance of the notes, each holder of notes (other than screened affiliates and regulated banks) agrees,
in connection with any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the trustee to provide a notice of
default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i) deliver a written
representation to the issuer and the trustee that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in
connection with its investment in the notes (other than screened affiliates and regulated banks) are not (or, in the
case such holder is a depositary or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that
(together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under “Description of Notes”) with respect to the notes
and (ii) provide the issuer with such other information as the issuer may reasonably request from time to time in
order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of request therefor. These
restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable to make such a
representation.

**Federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain**
**circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the**
**guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the**
**guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees may be subject to review under federal and state fraudulent
conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes (including federal bankruptcy laws), if an action (either in connection
with a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization case or under a lawsuit in which a bankruptcy is not involved), were
commenced at some future date by an issuer, by the guarantors or on behalf of unpaid creditors of the issuer or the
unpaid creditors of a guarantor. While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of
the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent
transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees were undertaken with the intent of
hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) the issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received
less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee and, in
the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true:

    - the issuer or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or
the guarantees;

    - the issuance of the notes or guarantees left the issuer or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably
small amount of capital to carry on the business in which such issuer or such guarantor was engaged or
about to engage; or

    - the issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that it would, incur debts beyond its ability
to pay as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee or further
subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of such issuer or such
guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such
guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not
receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with
respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in the acceleration of such debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary
depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a


-----

court would use to determine whether or not the issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or,
regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the issuer or a guarantor was indeed
insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not
constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the
notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that an issuer or a
guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee and/or
lien if such issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes
or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be
subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit
of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the
applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes.

To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers or
holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of notes would cease to have any direct
claim against the applicable guarantor. If a court were to hold a guarantee unenforceable, the applicable guarantor’s
assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to
the payment of the guarantee of the notes. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other
sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that
you already received from the issuer or the applicable guarantor.

Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit
that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations
under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a
legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law
or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, as noted above, any payment by an issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a
guarantee made at a time such issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be
returned to such issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of such issuer’s or guarantor’s creditors if such
payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any noninsider party and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party (as the case may be) more than such
creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the
notes or the guarantees to other claims against the issuer or the guarantors under the principle of equitable
subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct;
(ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the
holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code.


-----

**Any future guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.**

Guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were
delivered to guarantee previously existing indebtedness. Any future issuance of a guarantee, including pursuant to
guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued, may be avoidable by the guarantor
(as a debtor in possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or
circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the guarantor is insolvent at the time of the issuance of
the guarantee, (2) the issuance of the guarantee permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a
hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the guarantee had not been given and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of
the guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the issuance of the guarantee, or, in certain circumstances, a
longer period. Accordingly, if the issuer or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date
of the notes and any guarantees not issued on the issue date of the notes had been issued less than 90 days before
commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a
preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the issue date of the notes (even if the other guarantees
issued on the issue date of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such
guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the guarantee.

**Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released**
**under certain circumstances, the holders of the notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the**
**guarantors.**

Holders of the notes have the benefit of the guarantees of the guarantors. However, the guarantees by the
guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law.
As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon (among other
things) the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully
above, a court under federal or state fraudulent conveyance and fraudulent transfer statutes could void the
obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “—Federal and
state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes
and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the notes
to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any
payments on the notes.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain
circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**We may not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indenture**
**that will govern the notes.**

Upon a change of control triggering event, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you
will have the right to require the issuer to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101%
of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In order to
obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to refinance
the notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the notes on reasonable terms, if at all. The
issuer’s failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event
of default under the indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our
other debt, including debt under the senior secured credit facilities. Our future debt also may contain restrictions on
repayment requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the
indenture that will govern the notes.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain specified asset sales, the issuer may be required to offer to
purchase outstanding notes and indebtedness under the senior secured credit facilities, at 100% of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. The source of funds
for any such purchase of the notes will be the issuer’s available cash or cash generated from the issuer’s operations
or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The issuer may not be able to purchase the
notes upon such an asset sale offer because the issuer may not have sufficient financial resources at the time of such
asset sale to make the required purchase of notes and such other indebtedness, or because restrictions in the issuer’s
other indebtedness will not allow such purchase of the notes. Any of the issuer’s future debt agreements may contain
similar provisions. Accordingly, if such an asset sale were to occur, the issuer may not have sufficient financial


-----

resources to purchase the notes and such other indebtedness that the issuer would be required to offer to purchase or
that become immediately due and payable as a result. The issuer may require additional financing from third parties
to fund any such purchases, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory
terms or at all. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.” The issuer’s failure
to pay holders tendering notes and such other indebtedness upon such an asset sale would result in an event of
default under the indenture that will govern the notes.

**We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations, acquisitions by broadly held**
**companies and other highly leveraged transactions that do not constitute a change of control but that could**
**adversely affect the holders of the notes.**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations or the direct or indirect acquisition
of the issuer by a company that does not have a majority shareholder, may not, under the indenture that will govern
the notes, constitute a “change of control triggering event” that would require the issuer to purchase the notes,
notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise
adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter
into certain transactions, including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which
would not constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes, but that could increase the
amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. In
addition, in the event a transaction constitutes a “Permitted Change of Control” under the indenture that will govern
the notes, the issuer will be permitted to make distributions, pay dividends and make other restricted payments in
connection with that transaction that may otherwise be prohibited by the indenture.

**Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to**
**have the notes purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.**

The definition of change of control in the indenture that will govern the notes includes a phrase relating to
the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the issuer to
purchase its notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description
of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control Triggering Event.”

**An active trading market may not develop for the notes.**

The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We cannot assure you
that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. The issuer does not intend to
apply for listing of the notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. Although we have been
informed by the initial purchasers that they currently intend to make a market for the notes, they are not obliged to
do so and any market making may be discontinued at any time without notice.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be adversely affected by, among other things:

    - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the notes;

    - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

    - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

    - the number of holders of the notes;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

    - the conditions of the financial markets; and

    - prevailing interest rates.


-----

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely
to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities that are similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if
any, for the notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect the
prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our
performance, and other factors.

**Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights and the issuer does not intend to**
**register the notes under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on your ability to transfer or**
**resell the notes.**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. The
issuer is not obligated, and does not intend, to register the notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the
notes in an exchange offer registered under the Securities Act. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require
the issuer to register the notes for resale or otherwise. As a result, for so long as the notes remain outstanding, they
may be transferred or resold only in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of federal and applicable
state securities laws.

**The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we**
**will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act.**

The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not
be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are
similar provisions in the indenture that will govern the notes.

**A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may**
**adversely affect the market price or liquidity of the notes.**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.
Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their
overall view of our industry. The notes offered hereby will have a non-investment grade rating on the issue date of
the notes. There can be no assurances that such rating will remain for any given period of time or that such rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future
circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Credit ratings are not
recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the notes, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Additionally,
credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the notes. If the
credit rating of the notes is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your
notes without a substantial discount.

**The lenders under the senior secured credit facilities have the discretion to release any guarantor**
**under the senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause such guarantor to be**
**released from its guarantee of the notes.**

While any obligations under the senior secured credit facilities remain outstanding, a guarantor’s guarantee
of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the trustee under the
indenture that will govern the notes, at the discretion of lenders under the senior secured credit facilities, if the
guarantor no longer guarantees obligations under the senior secured credit facilities or any other indebtedness. See
“Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to


-----

release the guarantees under the senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a
claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and other
liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those non-guarantor subsidiaries will be
structurally senior to claims of noteholders.

**There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees**
**will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee.**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a
subsidiary guarantor of the notes will be automatically released to the extent such subsidiary guarantor is released in
connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not
prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes. The indenture also will permit us to designate one or more of
our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the
guarantee of such subsidiary guarantor being automatically released. If a subsidiary guarantor is released from its
guarantee of the senior secured credit facilities and certain other indebtedness of the issuer or any other guarantor,
other than in connection with a refinancing of the senior secured credit facilities and such other indebtedness or a
payment under such guarantee, or a guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge
or security interest securing the secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the notes will be automatically
released as well, in which case any liens on the assets of such subsidiary in favor of the senior secured credit
facilities will also be released. If the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor is released, no holder of the notes will
have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables
and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally senior to the claim
of any holders of the notes. For a description of all circumstances in which a guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will
be automatically released, see “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**We cannot assure you that the procedures for book-entry interests to be implemented through The**
**Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of your rights under the**
**notes.**

Unless and until notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for global notes, owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the notes except in the limited circumstances
provided in the indenture governing the notes. DTC (or its nominee) will be the sole registered holder of the global
notes representing the notes. After payment to DTC or the common depositary, we will have no responsibility or
liability for the payment of interest, principal, or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly,
if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of DTC, and if you are not a participant in DTC,
on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a
holder under the indenture governing the notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

Unlike the holders of the notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers, or other actions from holders of the notes. Instead, if
you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies
to do so from DTC. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be
sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through DTC. We cannot assure you that the procedures to
be implemented through DTC will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the notes. See “Book
Entry, Delivery and Form.”

**Holders of the notes may not be able to effect service of process or enforce judgments obtained**
**against us outside of the United States.**

The issuer and the subsidiary guarantors are organized under the laws of the United States. A substantial
portion of our assets are located in the United States and, as a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect
service of process or enforce judgments obtained against us outside the United States.


-----

**Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the**
**guarantee of the Parent Guarantor may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the guarantee of**
**the Parent Guarantor.**

The Parent Guarantor is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Enforcement of the obligations
under the guarantee against the Parent Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to the Parent
Guarantor. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance,
corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amount recoverable under the guarantee of the
Parent Guarantor and the amount recoverable thereunder is limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed
by the Parent Guarantor under the applicable laws of England and Wales, to the extent that the granting of such
guarantee is not in the Parent Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such guarantee exceeds the benefit to
the Parent Guarantor, or such guarantee would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or thin
capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of the Parent Guarantor to
contravene its fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.”

**Enforcing your rights as a holder of the notes or under the guarantees across multiple jurisdictions**
**may be difficult.**

The notes will be issued by the issuer, a company which is incorporated under the laws of the United
States, and guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor, which is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and the
subsidiary guarantors, which are all organized under the laws of the United States. Your rights under the notes and
the guarantees will therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in the jurisdictions mentioned above, in the jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization of a future guarantor, or in other jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings
are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding
the enforcement of your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Your rights under
the notes and the guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and
there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, foreign exchange, exchange control regulations, administration,
examinership and other laws of England and Wales may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the
United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to
obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict amongst
them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to
enforce your rights and collect payment in full under the notes and the guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees” with respect to some of the jurisdictions mentioned above.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Refinancing
Transactions, assuming they occurred on March 30, 2024 and based on estimated amounts outstanding on that date.
Actual amounts will vary from the estimated amounts shown below depending on several factors, including, among
others, the amount of cash and cash equivalents balances, indebtedness (including accrued interest on such
indebtedness), in each case, of Gates, changes made to the sources of the contemplated financings and differences
from our estimated fees and expenses.

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates are agents and/or lenders under the senior secured
credit facilities or holders of the 2026 Notes, and, accordingly, may receive a portion of the proceeds of this
offering. See “Plan of Distribution.”

You should read the following together with the information included under the headings “Summary—The
Refinancing Transactions” and “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness” included elsewhere in this

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “Certain Definitions.” In this
description, (1) the term “Issuer” refers initially to Gates Corporation, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Gates
Industrial Corporation plc; (2) the term “Parent Guarantor” refers initially to Gates Industrial Holdco Limited, a
direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Gates Industrial Corporation plc and an indirect parent company of the Issuer;
and (3) the terms “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to the Parent Guarantor and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of   % senior notes due 2029 (the
**_“Notes”) under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date among the Issuer, the Guarantors_**
and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Notes will be issued in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors;
Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer does not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. The Issuer will not be
required to, nor does it currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act
or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of
the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture. It does not purport
to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Indenture, including the
definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, and not this
description, will define your rights as Holders of the Notes. You may request a copy of the Indenture at our address
set forth under “Information Incorporated by Reference.”

**Brief Description of the Notes**

The Notes will be:

    - general, unsecured, senior obligations of the Issuer;

    - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent of
the value of the collateral securing such Secured Indebtedness;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes; and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock
and other liabilities of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

**Guarantees**

The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Parent Guarantor (such guarantee, the
“Parent Guarantee”) and its existing and future wholly-owned Domestic Subsidiaries that are Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) that are required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the Indenture (together with
the Parent Guarantor, the “Guarantors,” and such guarantees, the “Guarantees”). The Parent Guarantor’s existing
or future Foreign Subsidiaries, existing or future FSHCO Subsidiaries, any future Securitization Subsidiaries or any
future Captive Insurance Subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the Notes. Following the consummation of this
offering, Omaha Holdings LLC, Gates Holding 1 LLC and Gates Global LLC, which are obligors under the Existing
Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, are expected to be liquidated and as a result released as Guarantors
under the Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.


-----

The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally guarantee, fully
and unconditionally, on a senior unsecured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether
at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether
for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on
the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture or a supplement thereto.

As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor that guarantee certain
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor will guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to
release and discharge as described in this “Description of Notes.”

Each of the Guarantees will be:

    - a general, unsecured, senior obligation of such Guarantor;

    - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
secured to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such Secured Indebtedness;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated
in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor; and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock
and other liabilities of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the
Issuer).

As of March 30, 2024, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions:

    - the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had $2,366.4 million in total indebtedness outstanding
(excluding approximately $28.6 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit), none of which would
have been subordinated and of which $1,866.4 million would have been senior secured indebtedness,
consisting entirely of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; and

    - the Issuer would have had $500.0 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under
the revolving portion of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (after giving effect to approximately
$28.6 million of outstanding letters of credit).

All of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” unless designated as
Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Indenture. Under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to
designate certain of our existing and future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

For the twelve months ended March 30, 2024, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 75% of our revenues and approximately 74% of our Adjusted EBITDA. As
of March 30, 2024, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately
68% of our total assets and approximately 65% of our total liabilities. As of March 30, 2024, after adjusting for
certain structural intercompany loan assets and liabilities that largely offset each other, our non-guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 68% of our total assets and approximately 25% of our total liabilities. In the
event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries,
such non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to
distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our
non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes and the
Guarantees. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may
be incurred by the Parent Guarantor or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Subsidiaries. As of


-----

the Issue Date, the Parent Guarantor and each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities will guarantee the Notes.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be
effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable
Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered
voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent
liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its
Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal
and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the
notes and the guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes and the guarantees and/or require holders of the
notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any
payments on the notes.”

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such
other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the
time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, or consummate a
Division as the Dividing Person, or sell all or substantially all its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor without
limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—
Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.”

Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon:

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock
of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each
case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with or is not
prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments thereof);

(2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of
Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or the release or discharge of such other
guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or
release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood
that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this
provision, and that if any such guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated,
but with respect to the Subsidiary Guarantors, to the extent that such Guarantor would then be
required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”);

(3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions
of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or Division of any Guarantor with and into the
Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation or winding up of such Guarantor, in each case,
in compliance with or in a manner not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(5) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event;


-----

(6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”;

(7) the exercise by the Issuer of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described
under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations
under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(8) in the case of the Parent Guarantor, if the Parent Guarantor ceases to be the parent of the Issuer as
a result of a transaction or designation permitted pursuant to the definition of the “Parent
Guarantor”.

Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur,
then the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions
reasonably necessary to provide that the Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (with
respect to the Subsidiary Guarantors, to the extent such guarantee is required by the covenant described under “—
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90
days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to
receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer and at the Issuer’s expense, will execute such documents
reasonably requested by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of
such Guarantee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to
reflect any such release, discharge or termination. The Trustee shall not be liable for any such release undertaken in
reliance upon any such Officer’s Certificate.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million of Notes on the Issue Date. The
Notes will mature on May  , 2029.

Subject to compliance with the covenants described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the Issuer may
issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”) from time to time after this offering under the Indenture. The Notes
offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single class for
all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase; provided,
_however, that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for the Additional Notes, unless the Notes and the Additional_
Notes are treated as fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context requires otherwise, references
to “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of notes” include any Additional Notes that are
actually issued.

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on each May         and November   commencing November , 2024 to the Holders of
Notes of record on the immediately preceding         and         (whether or not a Business Day),
respectively. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from and including the Issue Date. If the Issuer delivers global notes to the Trustee for
cancellation on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the
accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the
Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the
applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.


-----

**Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest**

Cash payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be payable at the office or
agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose (the “paying agent”) or, at the option of the Issuer, cash payment
of interest on the Notes may be made through the paying agent by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their
respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided that (a) all cash payments of principal, premium, if
any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held
by DTC or its nominee will be made through the paying agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof and (b) all cash payments of principal, premium, if
any, and interest with respect to certificated Notes may, at the option of the Issuer, be made by wire transfer to a
U.S. dollar account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if the applicable Holder elects payment
by wire transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the paying agent to such effect designating such account
no later than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee
may accept in its discretion). Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuer’s office or agency will be the office
of the Trustee maintained for such purpose.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Parent Guarantor in respect of its Guarantee will be made free
and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes or other governmental charges
unless the withholding or deduction of such taxes or other governmental charges is then required by law or the
administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for any present or future taxes or other governmental charges
of the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) in which the Parent Guarantor
is resident shall at any time be required by such jurisdiction (or any such political subdivision or taxing authority) in
respect of any amounts to be paid by the Parent Guarantor under its Guarantee, the Parent Guarantor will pay to the
Holders of the Notes such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received by the Holders of the Notes who, with respect to any such tax or other governmental charge, are
not resident in such jurisdiction, after such deduction or withholding, shall be not less than the amounts that would
have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such deduction or withholding; provided, however,
that no Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to:

(1) any tax or other governmental charge imposed by the United States or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein;

(2) any tax or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the existence of
any present or former connection between the Holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such Holder
or beneficial owner, if such Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, nominee, partnership, limited
liability company or corporation) and the applicable taxing jurisdiction or any political subdivision or
territory or possession thereof or area subject to its jurisdiction, including, without limitation, such Holder
or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member, shareholder or possessor)
being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or being or having been present or engaged in trade or
business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein, other than any such present or
former connection arising solely from the holding of the Notes or enforcement of rights and the receipt of
payments with respect to the Notes;

(3) a deduction or withholding with respect to any payment of (or in respect of) the principal of, or
any interest on, the Notes to any Holder who is a fiduciary, partnership or other entity that is not the sole
beneficial owner of such payment to the extent such payment would be required by the laws of the
applicable taxing jurisdiction (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) to be
included in the income for tax purposes of a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member
of such partnership or other entity, or a beneficial owner who would not have been entitled to such
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the Holder of the
Notes;


-----

(4) any tax or other governmental charge that would not have been imposed but for the presentation of
the Notes (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which
such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for,
whichever occurs later;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar tax or other governmental
charge;

(6) any tax or other governmental charge that is payable otherwise than by withholding from
payments of (or in respect of) principal of, or any interest on, the Notes;

(7) any tax or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of (i) the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes to comply with a request of the Parent Guarantor addressed to
the Holder to provide information concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the
applicable taxing jurisdiction of the Holder or such beneficial owner or (ii) the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Notes to make any declaration of non-residence or other similar claim for
exemption or satisfy any information or reporting requirement that is required or imposed by a statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the applicable taxing jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from all or part of such tax or other governmental charge;

(8) any tax or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes to comply with the requirements of Sections 1471 through
1474 of the Code (or any amended or successor version), the U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder
or any official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant thereto, and any
intergovernmental agreements implementing the foregoing (including any legislation or other official
guidance relating to such intergovernmental agreements); or

(9) any combination of items above.

The Parent Guarantor will provide the Trustee and the paying agent with reasonable documentation
evidencing the payment of any taxes or other governmental charges in respect of which the Parent Guarantor has
paid any Additional Amounts. Copies of such documentation will be provided to a Holder upon written request. At
least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable (unless
such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to such date, in which
case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Parent Guarantor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with
respect to such payment, the Parent Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee and the paying agent an Officer’s
Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set
forth such other information necessary to enable the paying agent to remit such Additional Amounts to Holders on
the payment date.

Whenever in this offering memorandum, the Indenture or the Notes there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of (or in respect of) the principal of, or interest on, the Notes, such mention shall be deemed to include
mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or
would be payable in respect thereof.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes
will be the Trustee.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars and transfer agents for the Notes. The initial registrar
and transfer agent will be the Trustee. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time. The paying agent will make payments on, and the transfer agent will facilitate
transfer of, the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.


-----

The Issuer may change the paying agent, the registrar or the transfer agent without prior notice to the
Holders. The Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee
may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of
Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer and the transfer agent will not be required
to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in
connection with a Change of Control Offer, an Alternate Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. Also, the Issuer and the
transfer agent will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a
notice of redemption of Notes to be redeemed or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder of a
Note will be treated as the owner of the Note for all purposes under the Indenture.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payment with respect to
the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described
under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” As market conditions warrant, we and our direct and
indirect equity holders, including the Investors, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may
from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately
negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained
in the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by
the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under
our credit facilities, or through other sources. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually
or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular
class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any
such purchases made at prices below the “adjusted issue price” of the Notes (as defined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in
related adverse tax consequences to us.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at its option prior to May  ,
2026. At any time prior to May  , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, at any time and from time to time, redeem the
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption (the “Redemption Date”), subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on
the Redemption Date.

At any time on and after May , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, at any time and from time to time,
redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at the redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on
the Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on May   of each of the years
indicated below:

**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2026 ..................................................................................... %

2027 ..................................................................................... %

2028 and thereafter .............................................................. 100.000%


-----

In addition, prior to May  2026, the Issuer may, at its option, at any time and from time to time, redeem an
aggregate principal amount of Notes not to exceed the amount of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Parent
Guarantor from one or more Equity Offerings or a capital contribution to the Parent Guarantor made with the Net
Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a
redemption price equal to (i)  % of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus (ii) accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
Redemption Date; provided that (1) the amount redeemed shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes issued under the Indenture (including any Additional Notes); (2) at least the lesser of (x) 50% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date and (y) $250.0
million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such
redemption (unless, in either case, all Notes are redeemed or repurchased or to be redeemed or repurchased
substantially concurrently); and (3) each such redemption occurs within 270 days of the date of closing of the
applicable Equity Offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate
Offer, Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer for the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such offer and the
Issuer, or any third party making such offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 60 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that
remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such offer
(which may be less than par and excluding any early tender or incentive fee in such offer) plus, to the extent not
included in the offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date,
subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in
a tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as applicable, Notes
owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any
successor thereof, or any Debt Fund Affiliate shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender
offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer, as applicable.

Notice of any redemption or offer to purchase, whether in connection with an Equity Offering, Change of
Control, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer, Advance Offer or other transaction or event or otherwise, may, at the
Issuer’s (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) discretion,
be given prior to the completion or occurrence thereof, and any such redemption, offer to purchase or notice may, at
the Issuer’s (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer)
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent (including conditions precedent applicable to different
amounts of Notes redeemed), including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering,
Change of Control, Asset Sale or other transaction or event, as the case may be. The Issuer may redeem Notes
pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be
delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that
redemptions made pursuant to different provisions may have different Redemption Dates or may specify the order in
which redemptions taking place on the same Redemption Date are deemed to occur. In addition, if such redemption
or offer to purchase is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the
Issuer’s (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer)
discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the
date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or
waived by the Issuer (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control
Offer) in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer (or, in the case of a
Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) in its sole discretion) by the
redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed, or that such notice or offer may be
rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change
of Control Offer) sole discretion. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice or offer to purchase that payment


-----

of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption or
offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.

The Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, its direct and indirect equityholders, including the Investors, any of its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates and members of our management may acquire the Notes by means other
than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer is redeeming or purchasing less than all of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time,
selection of the Notes to be redeemed or purchased will be made in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC;
_provided that no Notes in denominations of $2,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part._

Notices of redemption or purchase shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days (except as set forth in the fifth paragraph under “—Optional Redemption”) but not more
than 60 days (except as set forth in the fifth paragraph under “—Optional Redemption”) before the redemption date
to each Holder of Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC,
except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued
in connection with a defeasance or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. The Issuer may provide in any
redemption or purchase notice that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Issuer’s obligations
with respect to such redemption or purchase may be performed by another Person. If any Note is to be redeemed in
part only, any notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof
that has been or is to be redeemed.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the
original Note; provided that new Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notes called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for
redemption or purchase, unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On
and after the Redemption Date or purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption or
purchase price, interest ceases to accrue on the Notes called for redemption or purchase.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**Change of Control Triggering Event**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs after the Issue Date, unless
the Issuer has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the
offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control **_Payment”) equal_**
to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 60 days following any
Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will send (or cause to be sent) notice of such Change of Control
Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such
Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC with the following
information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control
Triggering Event,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer
will be accepted for payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the


-----

case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event as described below;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes
accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the
Change of Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on
the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to
the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of
business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new
Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The
unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof;

(7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control
Triggering Event and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the
Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time
(including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the
event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Change of
Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice or
offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any
or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived;

(8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control
Triggering Event covenant, that a Holder must follow; and

(9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the
Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of
business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a
letter (which may be a .pdf delivered electronically) setting forth the name of the holder of the
Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is
withdrawing its tendered Notes, or a specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Notes
purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes or withdraw
such election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating
that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain
conditions.


-----

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by them or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with a paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together
with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to
Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of
control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (which may include a Change of
Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event
that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a
waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness. In the
event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future
Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such
future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing
arrangements to be wound down.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available
when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make
more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no
present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could
decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of
Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at
such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional
Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—
Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Required
Holders. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any
covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the
Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or
(ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of
the Issuer) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price
equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance
with the terms of the Alternate Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering
Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control
Offer or Alternate Offer.


-----

A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Change of
Control Offer and the Alternate Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event
has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described
above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be
waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders.

**Asset Sales**

The Indenture will provide that the Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including, but not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sale) at
the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by
the Parent Guarantor at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, with respect to any Asset Sale in excess of the
greater of (x) $115.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75.0% of the consideration
for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative
basis), received by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in
the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected
on the Parent Guarantor’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated
balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date
of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Parent
Guarantor’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes
thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such
balance sheet, as determined by the Parent Guarantor) of the Parent Guarantor or such
Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the
Notes (other than intercompany liabilities owing to a Restricted Subsidiary being
disposed of), that are (i) assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in
connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or
indemnifies the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities or
(ii) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Parent Guarantor or
such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably
expected by the Parent Guarantor acting in good faith to be converted by the Parent
Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash
Equivalents received or expected to be received) or by their terms are required to be
satisfied for Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale;
and


-----

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Parent Guarantor or such
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this
clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $200.0 million
and (ii) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of any non-cash consideration converted into Cash
Equivalents) at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (or, at
the Issuer’s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the
time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value,

shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

Within 18 months after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and
(B) the receipt of any Net Proceeds of such Asset Sale, the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its
option, may apply an amount not to exceed the Applicable Asset Sale Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such
Asset Sale (the “Applicable Proceeds”),

(1) to reduce or offer to reduce Indebtedness (through a redemption, prepayment, repayment or
purchase, as applicable) as follows:

(a) Obligations under a Credit Facility to the extent such Obligations were incurred under
clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(b) Obligations under Secured Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary);

(c) Obligations under the Notes or any other Senior Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or
any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that if the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted
Subsidiary shall so reduce any Senior Indebtedness other than the Notes, the Parent
Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce Obligations under the
Notes on a pro rata basis with such other Senior Indebtedness by, at its option,
(x) redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or (y) purchasing
Notes through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market
prices (which may be below par), or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the
procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes
on a ratable basis with such other Senior Indebtedness for no less than 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon
up to the principal amount of Notes to be repurchased;

(d) Obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor,
other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(e) to the extent such Applicable Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of property or assets of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor, Obligations of the
Issuer or a Guarantor other than Subordinated Indebtedness and other than Indebtedness
owed to the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

_provided that to the extent the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary makes an offer to redeem, prepay,_
repay or purchase any Obligations pursuant to any of the foregoing clauses (a)-(e) at a price of no less than 100% of
the principal amount thereof, to the extent the relevant creditors do not accept such offering, the Parent Guarantor
and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have applied an amount of the Applicable Proceeds equal to such
amount not so accepted in such offer, and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (and such
amount shall instead constitute Declined Proceeds); or


-----

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any
business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Parent Guarantor or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of
such business such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital
expenditures or (c) acquisitions of other properties or assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), are
used or useful in a Similar Business or replace the businesses, properties and/ or assets that are the
subject of such Asset Sale; provided that the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer may elect to deem
Investments, capital expenditures or acquisitions within the scope of the foregoing clauses (a), (b)
or (c), as applicable, that occur prior to the receipt of the Applicable Proceeds to have been made
in accordance with this clause (2) so long as such deemed Investments, capital expenditures or
acquisitions shall have been made no earlier than the earliest of (x) the notice of such Asset Sale to
the Trustee, (y) the execution of a definitive agreement relating to such Asset Sale or (z) 180 days
prior to the consummation of such Asset Sale; or

(3) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than the end of such 18-month period_
shall be treated as a permitted application of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment or letter of
intent so long as the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent
with the good faith expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of
intent within six months of the end of such 18-month period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any
Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Applicable Proceeds are applied
in connection therewith, the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable
Commitment (a “Second Commitment”) within six months of such cancellation or termination; provided further
that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Applicable Proceeds are
applied, then such Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of
the Applicable Proceeds of any Asset Sale or Casualty Event by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary
Guarantor (a “Non-Guarantor Disposition”) (A) is (x) prohibited or delayed by or would violate or conflict with
applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other
organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States (including for the
avoidance of doubt restrictions, prohibitions or impediments relating to financial assistance, corporate benefit, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance and similar legal principles, restrictions on upstreaming and/or cross-streaming
of Cash Equivalents intra-group and relating to the fiduciary and/or statutory duties of the directors (or equivalent
Persons) of the Parent Guarantor and/or any of its Subsidiaries) or would conflict with the fiduciary and/or statutory
duties of such Subsidiary’s directors (or equivalent Persons), or (B) would result in, or could reasonably be expected
to result in, a risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of
management or consultant of such Subsidiary, an amount equal to the portion of such Applicable Proceeds so
affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by
the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor; provided that if at any time within one year
following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of
such affected Applicable Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, the applicable organizational
document or agreement or the applicable other impediment, an amount equal to such amount of Applicable Proceeds
so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or
reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with
this covenant or (ii) to the extent that the Parent Guarantor has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all
of the Applicable Proceeds of any Non-Guarantor Disposition could have a material adverse tax or cost consequence
with respect to such Applicable Proceeds (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any
prepayment whereby doing so the Parent Guarantor, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates
and/or their equityholders would incur a tax liability, including as a result of a tax dividend, a deemed dividend
pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax), the Applicable Proceeds so affected may be retained by the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor and an amount equal to such Applicable
Proceeds will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The non-application of any
prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a


-----

Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the
Parent Guarantor or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

Any Applicable Proceeds (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the
immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in
the second preceding paragraph in excess of the Excess Proceeds Threshold (as defined herein) will be deemed to
constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes
pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without
regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders and any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders
of the Notes pursuant to clause (1)(c) of the second preceding paragraph that are not accepted shall be deemed to be
Declined Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of such Applicable Proceeds exceeds the greater of (i)
$230.0 million and (ii) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer
shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of
any Indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the
holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as
applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal
to $1,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at
an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or
accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the
closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to
such Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds
Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the
Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Applicable Proceeds by making an
Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Applicable Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the
Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of
being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the
Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining
Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes
not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of
Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount
offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase
the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case
may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or
such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari
Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an
Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to
zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion).
Additionally, the Issuer may, at its option, make an Asset Sale Offer using Applicable Proceeds at any time after the
consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer),
any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Applicable
Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture.

An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect
to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or
Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the
Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such
Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.


-----

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of
any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in
the Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by
the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer
satisfies certain conditions.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to
which the Parent Guarantor or its Subsidiaries becomes a party may contain, restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to
repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes,
the Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay
such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to
repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a
default under such other agreements.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture that will apply to the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

If on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from either of the
Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event” and
the date thereof being referred to as the “Suspension Date”), then, the covenants specifically listed under the
following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum will no longer be applicable
to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”) until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as defined
below):

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”;

(4) the entire fourth paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All
Assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Parent Guarantor may not
designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

If and while the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended
Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Parent Guarantor


-----

and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of
time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) both of the Rating Agencies
withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade
Rating (or for the avoidance of doubt, only one Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or
downgrades that rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating in the event that such Rating
Agency was the only Rating Agency to give an Investment Grade Rating to the Notes), then the Parent Guarantor
and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with
respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in
this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the Guarantors will be suspended during the
Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess
Proceeds from any Asset Sales shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur
Liens to the extent provided for under “—Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) to the extent
provided for in such covenant and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall
be interpreted as though such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension
Period (but solely for purposes of the “—Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other
covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be
taken by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a
Default or Event of Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, and no Default or Event of Default will be
deemed to exist or have occurred as a result of any failure by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary to
comply with any of the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period; provided that (1) with respect to
Restricted Payments made after such reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be
calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in
effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited Condition Transaction
entered into during the Suspension Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred or committed, or Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited
Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued
pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; (3) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after such reinstatement pursuant
to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates”; (4) any encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses
(1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be
permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other
Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor shall be required
to comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary
during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in
connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension Period) will be classified to
have been made under clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees with
respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any
liability for any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to
comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period
or after that time based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and
(2) following a Reversion Date, the Parent Guarantor and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without
causing a Default or Event of Default, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or
obligations arising during any Suspension Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.


-----

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The
Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension
Event or Reversion Date have occurred, or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**Limited Condition Transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket, test or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any
provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or assumption of Liens,
repayments, Restricted Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and
Asset Sales or any disposition, issuance or other transaction excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale”), in each
case, at the option of the Parent Guarantor, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, any direct or indirect parent of the
Parent Guarantor or any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the “Testing Party,” and
the election to exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such
basket, test or ratio or whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor
is complied with or satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the
Indenture shall be deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreements or letter of
intent (or, if applicable, a binding offer, or launch of a “certain funds” tender offer) for such Limited Condition
Transaction are entered into (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a notice, declaration or making of a Restricted
Payment or similar event), or (b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code
on Takeovers and Mergers or similar law or practices in other jurisdictions apply, the date on which a “Rule 2.7
announcement” of a firm intention to make an offer or similar announcement or determination in another
jurisdiction subject to similar laws in respect of a target of a Limited Condition Transaction or (c) any date occurring
after the occurrence of events described in either clause (a) or clause (b) and prior to the closing of such Limited
Condition Transaction, and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Transaction and
any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or
assumption of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or
assumption of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and Asset Sales or any disposition, issuance or other transaction excluded from the
definition of “Asset Sale”) and any related pro forma adjustments, disregarding for the purposes of such pro forma
calculation any borrowing under a revolving credit, working capital or letter of credit facility), as if they had
occurred at the beginning of the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters ending prior to the LCT Test Date for
which internal consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor are available, the Parent Guarantor or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on
the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and
conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been
complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes (in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is
committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial
statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Testing Party may elect, in its
sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which
case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of
such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios,
tests or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the
applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto
(including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or assumption of Liens, repayments, Restricted
Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and Asset Sales or any
disposition, issuance or other transaction excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale”) and (c) Consolidated Interest
Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on
the indicative interest margin contained in any financing commitment documentation with respect to such
Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin exists, as reasonably determined by the Testing Party in good
faith.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or
baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT


-----

Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with, including as a result of fluctuations in
any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in exchange rates or EBITDA or total assets of the Parent
Guarantor or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant transaction or action, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to
have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; provided that if such ratios, tests or baskets improve as a
result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, tests and/or baskets may be utilized; (2) if any related requirements
and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or
satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have
been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of
Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied
(and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating
the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited
Condition Transaction (including without limitation a separate Limited Condition Transaction) following the
relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is
consummated or the date that the definitive agreement, the date of notice or offer or date for redemption, purchase or
repayment specified in a notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as
applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be
determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto.

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for
purposes of determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires that no Default, Event of
Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such
action, as applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Testing Party, be deemed satisfied, so long as no
Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date of the definitive agreement,
the date of notice or offer or date for redemption, purchase or repayment for such Limited Condition Transaction, as
applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has exercised an LCT Election, and any Default, Event
of Default or specified Event of Default occurs following the date the definitive agreements (or, if applicable, the
date of delivery of a notice, declaration or making of a Restricted Payment or similar event) for the applicable
Limited Condition Transaction were entered into and prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction, any such Default, Event of Default or specified Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred
or be continuing for purposes of determining whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited
Condition Transaction is permitted under the Indenture.

**Certain Compliance Calculations**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred, assumed or issued, any Lien is incurred or assumed, any
Restricted Payment is made or other transaction is undertaken (including a Limited Condition Transaction) in
reliance on a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio or other ratio-based test, such ratio(s) shall be
calculated with respect to such incurrence, issuance or other transaction without giving effect to amounts being
utilized under any other non-ratio-based basket substantially concurrently. Each item of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock that is incurred, assumed or issued, each Lien incurred and each other transaction
undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, assumed, issued or taken first, to the extent available, pursuant to
the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio test. For the avoidance of doubt, when testing the availability under a ratio basket for
purposes of making a Restricted Payment, Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) incurred, assumed or issued the
proceeds of which are being utilized to make a Restricted Payment utilizing a non-ratio basket shall not be given
effect.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred, assumed or issued, any Lien is committed,
incurred, assumed or issued, any Restricted Payment is made or any other transaction is undertaken (including a
Limited Condition Transaction) in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio or other


-----

ratio-based test, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the commitment or incurrence of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility or letter of credit facility (1) immediately prior to or in connection
therewith or (2) used to finance working capital needs of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as
reasonably determined by the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer).

If a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one
applicable basket, permission or threshold under the Indenture, the Issuer shall be entitled to divide or classify or
later divide or reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such action, matter,
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) between such baskets, permission or thresholds as it shall elect from
time to time.

The Indenture shall provide that any calculation, test or measure that is determined with reference to the
Parent Guarantor’s financial statements (including, without limitation, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense,
Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total
Debt Ratio, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, and clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph under “—
Limitation on Restricted Payments”) may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a direct or
indirect parent entity of the Parent Guarantor instead, so long as such calculation, test or measure would not differ
by more than an immaterial amount when using the financial statements of such direct or indirect parent entity of the
Parent Guarantor as compared to if such calculation, test or measure were made using the Parent Guarantor’s
financial statements (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer).

Any ratios, tests or baskets required to be satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under the
Indenture shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to
one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or
down to the nearest number (with a rounding up if there is no nearest number).

If the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary takes an action which at the time of the taking of such
action would in the good faith determination of the Parent Guarantor be permitted under the applicable provisions of
the Indenture based on the financial statements available at such time, such action shall be deemed to have been
made in compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments, modifications or restatements
made in good faith to such financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income, EBITDA or other applicable
financial metric.

**Limitation on Restricted Payments**

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly:

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Parent
Guarantor’s, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’, Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder
of Equity Interests in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any
dividend, payment or distribution payable in connection with any merger, amalgamation or
consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments and distributions by the Parent Guarantor payable solely in Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent Guarantor or in options, warrants
or other rights to purchase such Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock); or

(b) dividends, payments and distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of
any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of
securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Subsidiary, the
Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such
dividend, payment or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or
series of securities;


-----

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the
Parent Guarantor or any direct or indirect parent company of the Parent Guarantor, including any
purchase, redemption, defeasance, acquisition or retirement in connection with any merger,
amalgamation or consolidation, in each case held by a Person other than the Parent Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for
value, in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any
Subordinated Indebtedness, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or

(b) the payment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or
retirement for value of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying
a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within
one year of the date of payment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance or
acquisition or retirement; or

(IV) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (IV) above (other than any exceptions
thereto) being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such Restricted
Payment:

(1) in the case of a Restricted Payment described under clauses (I) and (II) above and made
pursuant to clause (2)(a) of this paragraph, no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof and, in the case of a Restricted
Payment described under clauses (III) and (IV) above and made pursuant to clause (2)(a)
of this paragraph, no Event of Default described under clause (1), (2) or (6) of the first
paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” shall have occurred and be continuing
or would occur as a consequence thereof; and

(2) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue
Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1) (without duplication) and
6(c) of the next succeeding paragraph), but excluding all other Restricted Payments
permitted by the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without
duplication):

(a) 50.0% of the Consolidated Net Income of the Parent Guarantor for the period
(taken as one accounting period and including any predecessor of the Parent
Guarantor) beginning on July 1, 2014 to the end of the Parent Guarantor’s most
recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available
at the time of such Restricted Payment; plus

(b) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and the fair market value of
marketable securities or other property received by the Parent Guarantor or its
Restricted Subsidiaries after the Original Issue Date (other than Net Cash
Proceeds to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds have been used to incur
Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause
(12)(a) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”) from the issue or sale
of:


-----

(i) (A) Equity Interests of the Parent Guarantor, including Treasury
Capital Stock (as defined below), but excluding Net Cash Proceeds and
the fair market value of marketable securities or other property received
from the sale of:

(x) Equity Interests of the Parent Guarantor to any future,
present or former employees, directors, officers,
managers, independent contractors or consultants (or
their respective Controlled Investment Affiliates or
Immediate Family Members) of the Parent
Guarantor, any direct or indirect parent company of
the Parent Guarantor or any of the Parent Guarantor’s
Subsidiaries after the Original Issue Date to the
extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted
Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the
next succeeding paragraph; and

(y) Designated Preferred Stock; and

(B) to the extent such Net Cash Proceeds, marketable securities or
other property are actually contributed to the Parent Guarantor
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, Equity Interests of the
Parent Guarantor or any of the Parent Guarantor’s direct or
indirect parent companies (excluding contributions of the
proceeds from the sale of Designated Preferred Stock of any
such companies or contributions to the extent such amounts
have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance
with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph); or

(ii) Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary that
has been converted into or exchanged for such Equity Interests of the
Parent Guarantor or a parent company of the Parent Guarantor;

_provided that this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (W) Refunding_
Capital Stock (as defined below) applied in accordance with clause (2) of the
next succeeding paragraph, (X) Equity Interests or convertible debt securities of
the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary sold to a Restricted Subsidiary
or to the Parent Guarantor, (Y) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have

contributed to the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary for cancellation)
or that becomes part of the capital of the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary through consolidation, amalgamation or merger following the
Original Issue Date (other than (i) Net Cash Proceeds to the extent such Net
Cash Proceeds have been used to incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock pursuant to clause (12)(a) of the second paragraph of “—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock,” (ii) contributions by a Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent
Guarantor and (iii) any Excluded Contributions); plus


-----

(d) 100% of the aggregate amount received in Cash Equivalents and the fair market
value of marketable securities or other property received by the Parent
Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary by means of:

(i) the sale or other disposition (other than to the Parent Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary) of, or other returns on Investments from,
Restricted Investments made by the Parent Guarantor or its Restricted
Subsidiaries and repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted
Investments from the Parent Guarantor or its Restricted Subsidiaries
and repayments of loans or advances, and releases of guarantees, which
constitute Restricted Investments made by the Parent Guarantor or its
Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after the Original Issue Date; or

(ii) the issuance, sale or other disposition (other than to the Parent
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the Equity Interests of, or a
dividend or distribution (other than an Excluded Contribution) from an
Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than, in each case, to the extent the
Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by the Parent
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next
succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a
Permitted Investment, but including such Cash Equivalents and fair
market value to the extent exceeding the amount of such Investment),
in each case, after the Original Issue Date; or

(iii) any returns, profits, distributions, principal payments and similar
amounts received on account of any Permitted Investment or an
Investment otherwise permitted to be incurred under this “Limitation
on Restricted Payments” covenant and without duplication of any
returns, profits, distributions, principal payments or similar amounts
included in the calculation of such basket; plus

(e) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary or the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary into the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer of
all or substantially all of the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to the Parent
Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date, the fair market value
(as determined by the Parent Guarantor in good faith) of the Investment in such
Unrestricted Subsidiary (or the assets transferred) at the time of the
redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or at
the time of such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or transfer of assets, other
than to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by
the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clause (7) of the next
succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted
Investment made after the Original Issue Date, but, to the extent exceeding the
amount of such Permitted Investment, including such excess amounts of fair
market value; plus

(f) the aggregate amount of Cumulative Retained Asset Sale Proceeds and Declined
Proceeds since the Issue Date; plus

(g) the greater of (a) $300.0 million and (b) 40.0% of LTM EBITDA.

As of March 30, 2024, the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to this clause (2) (excluding
subclause (g)) was approximately $3,238.0 million.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit:


-----

(1) the payment of any dividend or other distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable
redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or other distribution or the
giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the
dividend or other distribution or redemption payment would have complied with the provisions of

such payment had been made directly by the Parent Guarantor and increase (or, without
duplication of any reduction of Consolidated Net Income, decrease) EBITDA to the
extent, if any, that Consolidated Net Income is reduced under this clause (15)(h) and such

federal, state and/or local income or similar Taxes (as applicable) of such tax group that are
attributable to the Parent Guarantor and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries and, to the extent of any cash
amounts actually received from its Unrestricted Subsidiaries; provided that in each case the
amount of such payments in respect of any taxable year does not exceed the amount that the
Parent Guarantor and/or its applicable Restricted Subsidiaries (and, to the extent permitted above,
its applicable Unrestricted Subsidiaries), as applicable, would have been required to pay in respect
of the relevant non-U.S. or U.S. federal, state or local income or similar Taxes for such taxable

(B) shall not exceed $100.0 million in any calendar year if, after giving pro forma effect to the

acquired in an Acquisition or other Investment or a current or former employee, officer, director,
manager, or consultant or independent contractor of a business acquired in an Acquisition or other
Investment (or their Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members), which
Capital Stock was issued as part of an earn-out or similar arrangement in the acquisition of such
business, and which redemption, acquisition, retirement or repurchase relates the failure of such
earn-out to fully vest.

_provided that at the time of, and after giving effect to, (a) any Restricted Payment under clause (11)(ii) above other_
than a Restricted Investment, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence thereof or (b) any Restricted Investment permitted under clause (11)(ii) above, no Event of Default
under clauses (1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” shall have occurred and be
continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted
Payment (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (25) above and/or one or more of the clauses
contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant, the Parent Guarantor will be entitled to divide or classify or later divide or reclassify (based on
circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) between
such clauses (1) through (25) and such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition
of “Permitted Investments,” in any manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Parent
Guarantor will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent
repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set
forth in the penultimate sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a
Restricted Payment in such amount would be permitted at such time, pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the
definition of “Permitted Investments,” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch-up payment”
with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

**Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock**

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or
otherwise (collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness) and the Parent Guarantor will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer
or a Subsidiary Guarantor to issue Preferred Stock; provided that the Parent Guarantor may incur Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor may issue shares of Preferred Stock, if (i) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio on a consolidated basis of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most
recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the
date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would
have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 or (ii) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio on a consolidated basis of the Parent
Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred
or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been equal to or less than 6.25 to 1.00, in each


-----

case determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the
additional Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case
may be, and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(1) Indebtedness incurred pursuant to any Credit Facilities by the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted
Subsidiary and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder
(with letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances being deemed to have a principal amount equal to
the face amount thereof); provided that immediately after giving effect to any such incurrence or
issuance (including pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), the then outstanding
aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness incurred or issued under this clause (1) does not
exceed the sum of (a) (x) $2,675.0 million, plus, (y) an amount equal to the greater of

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion
thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (34) above or is entitled to
be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Parent Guarantor, in its sole
discretion, may divide or classify, and may from time to time redivide and reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) and will only be
required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock in one or more of the above clauses or under the first paragraph of this covenant; provided
that all term Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the Issue Date
will be treated as incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph above;

(2) the Parent Guarantor will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock in more than one of the types of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock described in the first and second paragraphs above;

(3) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that
is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, then such other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be
included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Parent Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary,
or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or

(6) for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Debt
Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, in
connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph
above or the creation or incurrence of any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the
Issuer may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the committed amount of any


-----

Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such
Lien, as the case may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as described below,
the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if such
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt
Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, is satisfied with respect thereto on such
election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation
of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to be permitted under this
covenant or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or
the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing
or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is
met; provided that for purposes of subsequent calculations of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated
Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be
outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments
are outstanding or until the Issuer revokes an election of a Reserved Indebtedness Amount.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of LTM EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced
and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the
applicable provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence.
Any Refinancing Indebtedness and any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be incurred
under the Indenture to refinance Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1)-(34) above shall be deemed to include
additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest or
dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts,
fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such
refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount or liquidation
preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock was, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the
definitive documentation in respect thereof; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign
currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if
calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollardenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation
preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed (a) the principal
amount or liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus
(b) the aggregate amount of accrued but unpaid interest, fees, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, premiums
(including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar
fees) incurred in connection with such refinancing.

The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the


-----

currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely
because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or
issued or guaranteed by other obligors.

**Liens**

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or
indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that
secures Obligations under any Indebtedness for borrowed money or any related guarantee of Indebtedness for
borrowed money, on any asset or property of the Issuer or any Guarantor, or any income or profits therefrom, or
assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, unless (1) in the case of Subject Liens securing
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and related Guarantees are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or
proceeds that is senior in priority to such Subject Liens; and (2) in all other cases, the Notes or Guarantees are
equally and ratably secured, except that the foregoing shall not apply to or restrict Liens securing obligations in
respect of the Notes and the related Guarantees.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant shall be deemed
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Subject Lien that
gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes. In addition, in the event that a Subject Lien is or becomes a Permitted
Lien, the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer may, at its option and without consent from any Holder, elect to release and
discharge any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the preceding paragraph in respect of such
Subject Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially
All Assets” covenant, the Parent Guarantor may contribute or cause to be contributed Capital Stock of any or all of

described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control Triggering Event”.

**Transactions with Affiliates**

The Parent Guarantor will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment
to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets

guarantee with any Affiliate of the Parent Guarantor (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving
aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of (i) $75.0 million and (ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA at
such time, unless such Affiliate Transaction is on terms (when taken as a whole) that are not materially less
favorable to the Parent Guarantor or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
comparable transaction by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’slength basis or, if in the good faith judgment of the Parent Guarantor, no comparable transaction is available with
which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate Transaction is otherwise fair to the Parent Guarantor or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view and when such transaction is taken in its entirety.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) (a) transactions between or among the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or
any entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) and (b) any merger,

or present value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event, including an initial public equity
offering) pursuant to the Support and Services Agreement, or any amendment thereto or

disadvantageous in the good faith judgment of the Issuer to the Holders when taken as a whole, as
compared to the Support and Services Agreement as in effect immediately prior to such
amendment or replacement and (b) the payment of indemnification and other similar amounts to
the Investors and reimbursement of expenses of the Investors;

indirect parent companies or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(5) transactions in which the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such
transaction is fair to the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of
view or stating that the terms are not materially less favorable, when taken as a whole, to the
Parent Guarantor or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in
a comparable transaction by the Parent Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated
Person on an arm’s-length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Issue Date, or any amendment or replacement
thereto (so long as any such amendment or replacement is not materially disadvantageous in the

agreements which it (or any parent company of the Parent Guarantor) may enter into thereafter;
_provided,_ that the existence of, or the performance by the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or such parent company) of obligations under any future amendment to any such
existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be
permitted by this clause (8) to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement

extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and

or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other applicable
rights against the Parent Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment

Condition and Results of Operations”; (y) with respect to the annual and year-to-date interim
information, a presentation of “Adjusted EBITDA” of the Parent Guarantor substantially
consistent with the presentation thereof in this offering memorandum and derived from such
financial information; and (z) with respect to the annual financial statements only, a report on the
annual financial statements by the Parent Guarantor’s independent registered public accounting
firm; and

(2) substantially the same information that would be required to be contained in filings with the SEC
on Form 8-K under Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01 (only with respect to acquisitions that are
“significant” at the 20% or greater level pursuant to clauses (1)(i) and (ii) of the definition of
“Significant Subsidiary” under Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X only), 4.01, 4.02(a) and (b), 5.01 and
5.02(b) (with respect to the principal executive officer, president, principal financial officer and
principal operating officer only) and (c) (with respect to the principal executive officer, president,
principal financial officer and principal operating officer only and other than with respect to
information otherwise required or contemplated by subclause (3) of such Item or by Item 402 of


-----

Regulation S-K) as in effect on the Issue Date if the Parent Guarantor were required to file such
reports;

_provided, however, that (A) no such report will be required to include as an exhibit, or to include a summary of the_
terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or understanding between the Parent
Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect parent entities or its Subsidiaries) and any director, manager or officer, of
the Parent Guarantor (or any of its direct or indirect parent entities or its Subsidiaries), (B) the Parent Guarantor
shall not be required to make available any information regarding the occurrence of any of the events set forth in
clause (2) above if the Parent Guarantor determines in its good faith judgment that the event that would otherwise be
required to be disclosed is not material to the Holders of the Notes or the business, assets, operations, financial
positions or prospects of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (C) no such report
will be required to comply with Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K with respect
to any “non-GAAP” financial information contained therein, (D) no such report will be required to comply with
Regulation S-X including, without limitation, Rules 3-03(e), 3-05, 3-09, 3-10, 3-16, 13-01 and 13-02 or Article 11
thereof (or any successor or similar rules), (E) no such report will be required to provide any information that is not
otherwise similar to information currently included in this offering memorandum, (F) in no event will such reports
be required to include as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be
required to be filed as exhibits under the SEC rules, (G) trade secrets and other information that could cause
competitive harm to the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries may be excluded from any disclosures,
(H) such financial statements or information will not be required to contain any “segment reporting,” and (I) such
financial statements and information may, at the election of the Parent Guarantor, be prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP or IFRS.

All such annual reports shall be furnished within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year to which they
relate; all such quarterly reports shall be furnished within 60 days after the end of the fiscal quarter to which they
relate; and all such current reports shall be furnished within 15 days of the due date specified in the SEC’s rules and
regulations for reporting companies under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any annual reports or
quarterly reports may be furnished on or prior to the due date applicable to the Parent Guarantor or any parent entity
of the Parent Guarantor pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, if later than a date
provided in the preceding sentence.

The Parent Guarantor will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph of this covenant if the Parent Guarantor or any parent entity of the Parent Guarantor has filed reports
containing substantially such information (or any such information of a parent entity pursuant to the fourth
succeeding paragraph) with the SEC.

If the Parent Guarantor or any parent entity of the Parent Guarantor does not file reports containing such
information with the SEC, then the Parent Guarantor will make available such information and such reports to any
Holder of the Notes and to any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information on a
password-protected website or online data system which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will
make such information readily available to any bona fide prospective investor, any securities analyst (to the extent
providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or any market maker in the Notes who agrees to treat such
information as confidential; provided that the Parent Guarantor shall post such information thereon and make readily
available any password or other login information to any such bona fide prospective investor, securities analyst or
market maker; provided, however, that the Parent Guarantor may deny access to any information or reports
otherwise to be provided pursuant to this covenant to any such Holder, beneficial owner, bona fide prospective
investor, securities analyst or market maker that is a competitor or to the extent that the Parent Guarantor determines
in its sole discretion that the provision of such information to such Person may be harmful to the Parent Guarantor
and its Subsidiaries, its parent entities, or the Investors; provided, further, that such Holders, beneficial owners, bona
fide prospective investors, securities analysts and market makers shall agree to (A) treat all such reports (and
information contained therein) as confidential, (B) not to use such reports (and the information contained therein) for
any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (C) not publicly disclose any such
reports (and the information contained therein).

To the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Parent Guarantor will furnish to Holders of the Notes,
securities analysts and prospective investors upon request the information required to be delivered pursuant to


-----

Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), so long as the Notes are not
freely transferable under the Securities Act.

If any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor is an Unrestricted Subsidiary and if any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor, then the Parent Guarantor should furnish the annual and quarterly information
required by clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant, which shall include a presentation of selected financial
metrics (in the Parent Guarantor’s sole discretion) of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries as a group in the
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture will permit the Parent Guarantor to satisfy its obligations in
this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Parent Guarantor by furnishing financial
information relating to any parent entity of the Parent Guarantor; provided that if such parent entity does not
Guarantee the Notes then the same is accompanied by selected financial metrics that show the differences (in the
Parent Guarantor’s sole discretion) between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the
information relating to the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.
We expect to rely upon the immediately preceding sentence to provide financial statements, information and other
documents with respect to Gates Industrial Corporation plc for all information and reports provided following the
Issue Date.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parent Guarantor will not be deemed to have failed to
comply with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies”
until 180 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “—Reports
and Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Parent Guarantor will be deemed to have
satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to
have been cured.

The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished or made available to it and the
Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained
therein or determinable therefrom, including the Parent Guarantor’s or the Issuer’s compliance with any of its
covenants (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Guarantor will not be required to disclose any information or
take any actions that, in the good faith view of the Parent Guarantor, would violate applicable securities laws or the
SEC’s “gun-jumping” rules.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30.0% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a
default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes;

(4) (i) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which
there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Parent Guarantor or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor


-----

or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Parent Guarantor or a
Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the
issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its
stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an
obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any
other such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so
accelerated, aggregate the greater of (i) $200.0 million (or its foreign currency
equivalent) and (ii) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA or more outstanding;

(5) (i) failure by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the
Parent Guarantor for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other
Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of the greater of (i) $200.0 million and (ii) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of amounts
covered by insurance policies issued by reputable insurance companies), which final judgments
remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment
becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding
has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest
consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor for a fiscal quarter end provided as
required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary);
and

(7) the Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Parent
Guarantor for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect
or be declared null and void or any responsible officer of such Guarantor that is a Significant
Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of
the latest consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its
Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the
Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture.

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under
the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30.0% in aggregate principal amount of all the then
outstanding Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the
then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided that no such declaration may be made with
respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such declaration. Any
notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with
respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, instruction to the
Trustee to provide a notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of
acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section
or instruction to the Trustee to take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default under
clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or
more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written


-----

representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case
such Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not)
Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to
delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is
cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the
time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer
may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position
Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the
Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall
be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC’s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the
Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one
or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification
Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such
Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event
of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall
be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted
and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such
matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee, the Trustee shall refrain from acting in
accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing
Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any
Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of
such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s
participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing
Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have
been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio
(other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee), with the effect that such Event
of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee shall be
deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default,
shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder
Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then
the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if
such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required
under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance with such
Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the
accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements
in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with
respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or
otherwise. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on
a Noteholder Direction.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar
proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank.


-----

Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (or any agent) shall not be
liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any
Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee may
determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall not have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or
otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position
Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position
Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection
therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or
(vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments,
Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph
of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium, if any,
and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default
arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable
without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice
of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee
may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the
Indenture and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission
would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the
payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a non-consenting Holder).

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this
section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as
a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action
by the Trustee or the Holders, if after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action
(as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will not be under any obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes
unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided, to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to the
Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium
(if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a
Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing
and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this
section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant;

(2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of the first paragraph of this section,
Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant,
comprising at least 30.0% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of the Notes have offered, and if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;


-----

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the
offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Required
Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and
may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes (it
being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to
any Holder).

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement
regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware
of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or
waived within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any
Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to a
responsible officer of the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the
Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”

Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the
Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default giving rise to
such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this
paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may
(x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an
actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the
Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and
(y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Members, Partners, Employees and Equityholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or direct or
indirect equityholder of the Parent Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiaries or of any of their direct or indirect
parent companies (other than in such equityholder’s capacity as the Issuer or a Guarantor) shall have any liability,
for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees or the Indenture or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives
and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that
such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees, as the
case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon payment in full of all of the
Notes. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the
Notes and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure
all then existing Defaults and Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to
the Indenture;


-----

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of
such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default
or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not
including bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under
“—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the
Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuer shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the Issuer
for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S.
Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amount as will be sufficient, in the
opinion of an Independent Financial Advisor, without consideration of any reinvestment to pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest due on such Notes on the stated maturity date or on the
redemption date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes
and the Issuer must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular
redemption date; provided that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable
Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that
an amount is deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the Issuer for this
purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption,
with any deficit as of the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium
**_Deficit”) only required to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the_**
Issuer for this purpose) on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit
shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least one Business Day prior
to the date of the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax
law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that,
subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners


-----

of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound
(other than that resulting from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required
to effect such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and any similar and simultaneous deposit
relating to other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was
not made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors
of the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes (other than certain
rights of the Trustee and the Issuer’s obligations with respect thereto), when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which
have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in
trust, have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee or applicable registrar for cancellation
have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will
become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, (i) the Indenture, any Guarantee and the Notes
may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Required Holders (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and (ii) any existing Default or Event of
Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on
the Notes (which shall be considered waived only with respect to Notes held by consenting Holders), except a
payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture, any Guarantee or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Required Holders (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes).

Notwithstanding anything in this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section, the “Events of Default
and Remedies” section, the definition of “Required Holders” or otherwise in the Indenture to the contrary, for
purposes of determining whether the Required Holders have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment,
modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture, Notes or the
Guarantees or any departure by the Issuer or any Guarantor therefrom, unless the action in question affects any
Affiliated Holder in a disproportionately adverse manner than its effect on the other Holders, or any plan of
reorganization pursuant to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, (ii) otherwise acted on any
matter related to the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees or (iii) directed or required the Trustee or any Holder to
undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under the Indenture, the Notes or the

the Trustee or any Holder to take (or refrain from taking) any such action and all Notes held by any Affiliated
Holders shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all purposes of calculating whether the Required Holders have
taken any actions.

Notwithstanding anything in this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section, the “Events of Default
and Remedies” section, the definition of “Required Holders” or otherwise in the Indenture to the contrary, for
purposes of determining whether the Required Holders have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment,
modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture, the Notes or the
Guarantees or any departure by the Issuer or any Guarantor therefrom, (ii) otherwise acted on any matter related to
the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees or (iii) directed or required the Trustee or any Holder to undertake any
action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees, all
Notes held or beneficially owned by Debt Fund Affiliates may not account for more than 49.9% (pro rata among
such Debt Fund Affiliates) of the Notes of consenting Holders included in determining whether the Required
Holders have consented to any action pursuant to this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section.

In connection with any action under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees that requires a
determination of whether the Required Holders or any of the Holders, as applicable, have consented to such action
or otherwise acted on any matter or directed the Trustee to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action),
the Issuer shall identify the amount of Notes held or beneficially owned by an Affiliated Holder or a Debt Fund
Affiliate in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee, upon which the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively
rely without investigation.

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of Notes (including, for
purposes of this paragraph, Notes held or beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates), an amendment or waiver
may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;


-----

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or alter or waive the
provisions with respect to the redemption of such Notes (other than provisions relating to

systems) for redemption and conditions to redemption and (b) the covenants described above
under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the
Option of Holders”);

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest
on such Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of such Notes by the Required Holders, and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or
provision contained in the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee which cannot be amended or
modified without the consent of each affected Holder;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or the Notes of any Holder to
institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or
after the due dates therefor;

or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantees of the Parent Guarantor or
any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Subsidiary Guarantors
that, taken together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor for a
fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary, in any manner materially adverse to the Holders of such Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture to
which it is a party) and the Trustee (and any other agents party thereto (to the extent applicable)), as the case may
be, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee without the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of
assets;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;

(6) to add or modify covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuer or any Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;


-----

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee or a successor paying agent thereunder (or any other applicable agent) pursuant to the
requirements thereof;

(9) to secure the Notes and/or the related Guarantees or to add collateral thereto or enter into any
intercreditor agreement in connection therewith;

(10) to add an obligor or a Guarantor under the Indenture;

(11) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantees to any provision of this
“Description of Notes”;

(12) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and
administration of the Notes; provided, however, that such amendment does not materially and
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;

(13) to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when permitted or required
by the Indenture;

(14) to release and discharge any Lien securing the Notes when permitted or required by the Indenture
(including pursuant to the second paragraph under “Certain covenants—Liens”); and

(15) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under, “—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders” or “—Certain Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the covenants
in effect at the time of such action, shall be deemed to impair or affect any legal rights of any Holders of the Notes
to receive payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement
of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes.

by the Issuer as paying agent, registrar, and transfer agent with regard to the Notes.

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Required Holders will have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions.


-----

The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not be cured) of which the
Trustee has received written notice or a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge, the Trustee will be
required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own affairs.
The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of
any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered, and if requested, provided, to the Trustee security

week or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)
most nearly equal to the period from the date of such redemption notice to May   2026; provided, however, that if
the period from the date of such redemption notice to May   2026 is not equal to the constant maturity of a United
States Treasury security for which a yield is given, the Applicable Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear
interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States
Treasury securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the date of such redemption notice
to May   2026 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities

treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness.

**_“Fixed Charges” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of, without duplication:_**

(1) Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period (including for purposes of clause (b)
of the definition of “EBITDA” only, any non-cash interest expense);

(2) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any
series of Preferred Stock during such period; and


-----

(3) all cash dividends or other distributions paid (excluding items eliminated in consolidation) on any
series of Disqualified Stock during such period.

**_“Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the ratio of EBITDA of_**
such Person for such period to the Fixed Charges of such Person for such period. In the event that such Person or
any Restricted Subsidiary incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems, repays, retires or extinguishes any Indebtedness
(other than Indebtedness incurred under any revolving credit, working capital or letter of credit facility) or issues or
redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the period for which the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or substantially concurrently with the event for which the
calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is made (the “Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”),
then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption,
guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, including a pro forma application of the net proceeds
therefrom), as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, subject, for the
avoidance of doubt, to the paragraphs contained in “—Certain Covenants—Certain Compliance Calculations”;
_provided, however, that the pro forma calculation of Fixed Charges for purposes of the first paragraph under “—_
Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock” (and for the purposes of other provisions of the Indenture that refer to such first paragraph) shall not give
effect to any Indebtedness being incurred on such date (or on such other subsequent date which would otherwise
require pro forma effect to be given to such incurrence) pursuant to the second paragraph under “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”
(other than Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to subclause (2) of the proviso to clause (14) thereof).”

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), operational
changes, Business Expansions, new or revised contracts and other transactions that have been made by or involving
the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to
such reference period and on or prior to or substantially concurrently with the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date shall be calculated on a pro forma basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions,
dispositions, mergers, amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations, operational changes, Business
Expansions, new or revised contracts and other transactions (and the change in any associated fixed charge
obligations and the change in EBITDA resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter
reference period; provided that at the election of the Parent Guarantor, such pro forma adjustments shall not be
required to be determined to the extent the aggregate consideration paid in connection with such acquisition or other
transaction was less than the greater of (i) $75.0 million and (ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA. If since the beginning of
such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or
consolidated with or into the Parent Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such
period shall have made any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued
operation, operational change, Business Expansion or other transaction that would have required adjustment
pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto
for such period as if such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued
operation, operational change, Business Expansion, new or revised contract or other transaction had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to an Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, Business Expansion,
new or revised contract or other transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a responsible
financial or accounting officer of the Parent Guarantor or its Restricted Subsidiaries (and may include, for the
avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expense reductions and product margin and other synergies resulting
from such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation,
operational change, Business Expansion, new or revised contract or other transaction which is being given pro
_forma effect) calculated in accordance with and permitted by clause (1)(h) and (1)(o) of the definition of_
“EBITDA.” If any Indebtedness bears a floating or formula rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Hedging Obligations
applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest


-----

rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Parent Guarantor to be the rate of
interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the
computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro
_forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable_
period except as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be
determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or
other rate, shall be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such
optional rate chosen as the Parent Guarantor may designate.

**_“Foreign Subsidiary” means (i) any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor that is not a Domestic Subsidiary_**
and (ii) any direct or indirect Domestic Subsidiary that is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of a direct or indirect
Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC.

Interests and/or Indebtedness of one or more Foreign Subsidiaries that are CFCs, Domestic Subsidiaries of a direct
or indirect Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC, or Subsidiaries that are FSHCO Subsidiaries, and any other assets
incidental thereto.

**_“GAAP” means, at the election of the Parent Guarantor, (1) the accounting standards and interpretations_**
adopted by the International Accounting Standard Board, as in effect from time to time (“IFRS”) if the Parent
Guarantor’s financial statements are at such time prepared in accordance with IFRS or (2) generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America, as in effect from time to time (“U.S. GAAP”) if the Parent
Guarantor’s financial statements are at such time prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it being understood that,
for purposes of the Indenture, (a) all references to codified accounting standards specifically named in the Indenture
shall be deemed to include any successor, replacement, amendment or updated accounting standard under IFRS or
U.S. GAAP, as applicable, (b) neither IFRS nor U.S. GAAP shall include the policies, rules and regulations of the
SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the International Accounting Standards Board or any
other applicable regulatory or governing body applicable only to public companies, (c) any calculation or
determination in the Indenture that requires the application of GAAP across multiple quarters need not be calculated
or determined using the same accounting standard for each constituent quarter, (d) all calculations or determinations
in the Indenture shall be made without giving effect to any election under FASB Accounting Standards Topic 825,
_Financial Instruments, or any successor thereto or comparable accounting principle, to value any Indebtedness or_
other liabilities at “fair value” (as defined therein) and (e) in the event that the Parent Guarantor makes an election
referred to in the definition of “Financing Lease Obligations,” the accounting for operating leases and financing or
capital leases under U.S. GAAP as in effect on January 1, 2015 (including, without limitation, Accounting Standards
Codification 840) or IFRS as in effect on January 1, 2018 (such that the impact of IFRS 16 (Leases) shall be
disregarded) shall apply for the purpose of determining compliance with the provisions of the Indenture, including
the definition of Financing Lease Obligation.

For the avoidance of doubt, solely making an election (without any other action) referred to in this
definition will not (1) be treated as an incurrence of Indebtedness or (2) have the effect of rendering invalid any
payment, Investment or other action made prior to the date of such election pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or any incurrence of Indebtedness incurred prior to the
date of such election pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (or any other action conditioned on the Parent
Guarantor and the Restricted Subsidiaries having been able to incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness) if such
payment, Investment, incurrence or other action was valid under the Indenture on the date made, incurred or taken,
as the case may be.

If there occurs a change in IFRS or U.S. GAAP, as the case may be, and such change would cause a change
in the method of calculation of any term or measure used in the Indenture (an “Accounting Change”), then the
Parent Guarantor may elect that such term or measure shall be calculated as if such Accounting Change had not
occurred.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following section summarizes the terms of our other principal indebtedness expected to be in place
following the consummation of the Refinancing Transactions.

**New Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

Concurrently with or prior to the completion of the offering of the notes, we expect to enter into an
amendment to our existing senior secured credit facilities (the “amended senior secured credit facilities”).

We expect that the amended senior secured credit facilities will consist of the following:

    - the new $1,300.0 million senior secured U.S. dollar term loan facility (the “B-5 Dollar Term Loans”),
which will mature seven years from the closing date of the amended senior secured credit facilities (the
“Closing Date”);

    - the existing $566.4 million senior secured U.S. dollar term loan facility (the “B-4 Dollar Term Loans”
and together with B-5 Dollar Term Loans, the “Dollar Term Loans”), which will mature in November
2029;

    - the amended $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”),
which will mature five years from the Closing Date.

Gates Corporation, which is referred to in this section as the “Borrower,” will be the borrower under the
amended senior secured credit facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility will include borrowing capacity available for
letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as the swing line borrowings. In addition, we expect that
the amended senior secured credit facilities will also provide us with the option to raise incremental credit facilities
(including an uncommitted incremental facility that allows us the option to increase the amount available under the
new term loan facilities and/or the new revolving credit facility by an aggregate of up to the greater of $750 million
and 100% Adjusted EBITDA, subject to additional increases upon satisfaction of certain first lien net leverage-based
tests), refinance the loans with debt incurred outside the credit agreement and extend the maturity date of the
revolving loans and term loans, subject to certain limitations. We also expect the amended senior secured credit
facilities to include the terms below.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Borrowings under the Dollar Term Loans will bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to a margin over
either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the administrative agent’s prime lending rate,
(2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the Term SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus
1.00% or (b) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the applicable Term SOFR rate published on the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York’s website for the interest period relevant to such borrowing. The margins for the B-4
Dollar Term Loans are 3.00% per annum in the case of Term SOFR rate loans and 2.00% per annum in the case of
base rate loans, subject to a Term SOFR floor of 0.50% per annum. The margins for the B-5 Dollar Term Loans
which have not yet been determined, will be subject to a Term SOFR floor which has not yet been determined.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to a margin
over either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the administrative agent’s prime lending rate,
(2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the Term SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus
1.00% or (b) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the applicable Term SOFR rate published on the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York’s website for the interest period relevant to such borrowing for Dollar Term Loans, a
EURIBO rate determined by reference to the Banking Federation of the European Union for the interest period
relevant to such borrowing, a TIBOR rate determined by reference to Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate as administered
by the Ippan Shadan Hojin JBA TIBOR Administration or a SONIA rate determined by reference to the Sterling
Overnight Index Average published by the Bank of England (or any successor administrator of the Sterling
Overnight Index Average). The margins for the Revolving Credit Facility which have not yet been determined, will


-----

be subject to a Term SOFR floor of 0% per annum and subject to step-downs upon the achievement of specified first
lien net leverage ratios.

In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the amended senior secured credit facilities,
we will be required to pay a facility fee to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the
commitments thereunder. The facility fee rate which has not yet been determined, will be subject to a step-down
upon the achievement of a specified first lien net leverage ratio. We will also be required to pay customary letter of
credit fees.

**_Prepayments_**

The amended senior secured credit facilities will require us to prepay outstanding Term Loans, subject to
certain exceptions, with:

    - 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0%, as applicable, subject to our attaining certain
first lien net leverage ratios) of our annual excess cash flow;

    - 100% (which percentage will be reduced to 50% and 0%, as applicable, subject to our attaining certain
first lien net leverage ratios) of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other
dispositions of property by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (including insurance and
condemnation proceeds, subject to de minimis thresholds), if we do not reinvest those net cash
proceeds in assets to be used in our business or to make certain other permitted investments (a) within
18 months of the receipt of such net cash proceeds or (b) if we commit to reinvest such net cash
proceeds within 18 months of the receipt thereof, within 24 months of the date of initial receipt
(although in connection with any such prepayment, we may also repay other first lien debt to the extent
we are so required); and

    - 100% of the net proceeds of any incurrence of debt by the Borrower or any of its restricted
subsidiaries, other than debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the amended senior secured credit
facilities.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each lender of Term Loans will have the right to reject its pro rata
share of mandatory prepayments described above, in which case we may retain the amounts so rejected.

The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied pro rata to installments of Term Loans as directed
by the Borrower.

We will have the ability to voluntarily repay outstanding loans at any time without premium or penalty,
other than prepayment premium on voluntary prepayment of B-5 Dollar Term Loans in connection with a repricing
transaction on or prior to the date that we expect to be six months after the Closing Date.

**_Amortization_**

We will be required to repay installments on the Dollar Term Loans in quarterly installments equal to
0.25% of the original principal amount of the Dollar Term Loans, with the remaining amount payable on the
applicable maturity date with respect to such Term Loans.

**_Guarantees_**

The obligations under the amended senior secured credit facilities will be unconditionally and irrevocably
guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor which indirectly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the
Borrower, the direct parent of the Borrower, and, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Parent Guarantor’s
existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “U.S. Guarantors”). In addition,
the amended senior secured credit facilities will be collateralized by first priority or equivalent security interests in
(x) all the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Borrower and each of the Parent Guarantor’s material
direct or indirect wholly owned restricted domestic subsidiaries and direct wholly owned first-tier restricted foreign
subsidiaries (limited to 65% of the voting equity interests therein) and (y) certain tangible and intangible assets of
the Borrower and those of the U.S. Guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications) .


-----

As of the Closing Date for the amended senior secured credit facilities, none of our foreign subsidiaries or
our non-wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries will guarantee the amended senior
secured credit facilities.

**_Certain Covenants and Events of Default_**

The amended senior secured credit facilities will contain a number of significant negative covenants. Such
negative covenants, among other things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Parent
Guarantor and its restricted subsidiaries to:

    - incur additional indebtedness and make guarantees;

    - create liens on assets;

    - enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

    - engage in mergers or consolidations;

    - sell assets;

    - make fundamental changes;

    - pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;

    - make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions; and

    - make prepayments of subordinated debt.

The Parent Guarantor and its restricted subsidiaries will also be required to maintain a maximum first lien
net leverage ratio for the benefit of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility, not exceeding 4.50 to 1.00 if
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 30% of the issued and outstanding loans and commitments,
tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.

Our amended senior secured credit facilities will also contain certain customary representations and
warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the amended
senior secured credit facilities will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due
under the amended senior secured credit facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.

**BOOK ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

The notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in
reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Notes”). The notes also may be offered and sold to persons other than U.S.
persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S (“Regulation S Notes”). Except as set forth below, the
notes will be issued in registered, global form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000
in excess thereof. Notes will be issued at the closing of this offering only against payment in immediately available
funds.

Rule 144A Notes representing the notes initially will be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons (“Rule 144A Global Notes”). Regulation S Notes representing the notes
initially will be represented by one or more temporary global notes in registered form without interest coupons
(“Regulation S Temporary Global Notes”). Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement
of this offering and the closing of this offering (the “Distribution Compliance Period”), beneficial interests in the
Regulation S Temporary Global Notes may be held only through the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and
Clearstream Banking, S.A. (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that
takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below
under “Exchanges Among Global Notes.” Within a reasonable time period after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be exchanged for one or more permanent notes
in registered, global form without interest coupons (collectively, “Regulation S Permanent Global Notes”) upon
delivery to DTC of certification of compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes and pursuant to
Regulation S as provided in the indenture that will govern the notes. Regulation S Temporary Global Notes and
Regulation S Permanent Global Notes are referred to herein as “Regulation S Global Notes” and Rule 144A Global
Notes and Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as “Global Notes.”

Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S Temporary Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with
U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) as custodian for DTC and registered in
the name of DTC or its nominee, in each case for credit to an account of a direct or indirect participant in DTC as
described below. Beneficial interests in Rule 144A Global Notes may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in
Regulation S Global Notes at any time except in the limited circumstances described below. See “—Exchanges
Among Global Notes.” Except as set forth below, Global Notes may be transferred only to another nominee of DTC
or to a successor of DTC or its nominee, in whole and not in part. Except in the limited circumstances described
below, beneficial interests in Global Notes may not be exchanged for notes in certificated form and owners of
beneficial interests in Global Notes will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form. See
“—Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes.”

Rule 144A Global Notes and Regulation S Global Notes (including beneficial interests in the notes they
represent) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and will bear restrictive legends as described under
“Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of beneficial interests in Global Notes will be
subject to the applicable rules and procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including Euroclear and
Clearstream), which may change from time to time.

**Depository Procedures**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective
settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The issuer and the Trustee take no responsibility for these
operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these
matters.

DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of
New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”). DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the
“Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the


-----

Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities
brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other
organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly
(collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by
or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and
transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the
Participants and Indirect Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, DTC
will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal
amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes; and

(2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of
these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants)
or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in
Global Notes).

Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein
directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein
indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in
a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes
must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems,
or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period
(but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC
system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global
Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books
of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A.,
as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’
names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the
procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of
some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the
ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be
limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect
Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons
that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by
the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”)
and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture.
Under the terms of the indenture, the issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including
Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, neither the issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the issuer has or will have any responsibility
or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records
relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or


-----

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect
Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as
the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on
the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants
to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or
the issuer. Neither the issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in
identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be
protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions,” transfers
between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day
funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their
respective rules and operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand,
will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective
depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant
Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds
settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions
directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the
direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only
in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those
Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes
to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those
procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

Neither the issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

Prior to any exchange of any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Temporary Global Note for a beneficial
interest in a Regulation S Permanent Global Note:

    - the holder of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note must provide
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the indenture
that will govern the notes certifying that the beneficial owner of the interest in the Regulation S
Temporary Global Note is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that has purchased that interest in
a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act; and


-----

    - Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the Trustee (or the paying agent if other
than the Trustee) a certificate in the form required by the indenture that will govern the notes.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

    - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global
Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a
successor depositary is not appointed;

    - we, at our option, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes
(although Regulation S Temporary Global Notes at the issuer’s election pursuant to this clause may not
be exchanged for Certificated Notes prior to (a) the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period
and (b) the receipt of any certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S); or

    - there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default with respect to the notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior
written notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases,
Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in a Global Note will be
registered in the names, and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in
accordance with its customary procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Notice to
Investors; Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any
Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the issuer and the Trustee a written certificate (in the form
provided in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to the notes being transferred. See “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Temporary Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in
a Regulation S Permanent Global Note only after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and then only
upon provision of the certification described above under “—Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S
Temporary Global Notes.”

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

    - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

    - the transferor first delivers to the issuer and the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in
the indenture) to the effect that the notes are being transferred:

      - to a person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within
the meaning of Rule 144A and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified
institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

      - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other
jurisdictions.


-----

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution
Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the issuer and the Trustee a written certificate (in the form
provided in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of
Regulation S or Rule 144.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A
Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through the DTC
Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A
Global Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the
original Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be
subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in the other Global Note.
The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary
Global Note prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of notes represented by Global Notes, including payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its
nominee. We will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Certificated Notes by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no
account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s registered address. Notes represented by Global Notes are
expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market
trading activity in notes represented by Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in
immediately available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream
participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which
must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has
advised us that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or
through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of
DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for
Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes. This summary deals only with notes held as capital assets for U.S. federal
income tax purposes (generally, assets held for investment purposes) by persons who purchase the notes for cash
pursuant to this offering at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold for
money to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler).

As used herein, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is, for United States federal
income tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) that is created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

    - a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a
valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United
States person.

As used herein, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is neither a U.S.
holder nor an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes.

If any entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds
notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner in a partnership considering an investment in the notes, you should
consult your own tax advisors.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences applicable to you if you are a person subject to special tax treatment under the United States federal
income tax laws, including, without limitation:

    - a broker or dealer in securities or currencies;

    - a financial institution;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a real estate investment trust;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - an insurance company;

    - a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction
or a straddle;

    - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for its securities;


-----

    - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

    - a partnership or other pass-through entity (or an investor in such an entity);

    - a U.S. holder whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

    - a “controlled foreign corporation”;

    - a “passive foreign investment company”;

    - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as
a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

    - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), United States
Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be
changed or subject to different interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal
income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings
from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that
the IRS will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the
notes that are different from those discussed below.

This summary does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax
consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare contribution tax on
net investment income, any United States federal estate or gift tax consequences, or the effects of any state, local or
non-United States tax laws. It is not intended to be, and should not be construed to be, legal or tax advice to any
particular purchaser of notes.

**If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning**
**the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and**
**disposition of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax laws**
**and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Certain Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to
U.S. holders of the notes.

**_Stated Interest. Stated interest on the notes will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time_**
it is received or accrued, depending on your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax
purposes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes. Upon the sale,_**
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, you generally will recognize gain or loss
equal to the difference between the amount realized upon the disposition (less any amount attributable to accrued
and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest income as discussed above to the extent not previously
included in income) and your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note will generally be your
cost for the note. Any gain or loss you recognize will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be longterm capital gain or loss if you have held the note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate
U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.


-----

**Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to
non-U.S. holders of the notes.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax. Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA_**
below, United States federal withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the
“portfolio interest rule,” provided that:

    - interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States;

    - you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of voting stock of the issuer within the meaning of the Code and applicable United States
Treasury regulations;

    - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is actually or constructively related to the issuer
through stock ownership;

    - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code; and

    - either (1) you provide your name and address on an applicable and properly executed IRS Form W-8,
and certify, under penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the
Code or (2) you hold your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification
requirements of applicable United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to nonU.S. holders that are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to
a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly
executed:

    - IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) certifying an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

    - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not subject to
withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income Tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain
that you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note.

**_United States Federal Income Tax. If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and_**
interest on the notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an
applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment or fixed base), then you will
generally be subject to United States federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis in the same manner as
if you were a United States person as defined under the Code (although you will be exempt from the 30% United
States federal withholding tax, provided the certification requirements discussed above in “—United States Federal
Withholding Tax” are satisfied). In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits
tax equal to 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) of your effectively connected earnings and
profits, subject to certain adjustments.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, any gain realized on the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax
unless:


-----

    - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment
or fixed base), in which case such gain will generally be subject to United States federal income tax
(and possibly branch profits tax) in the same manner as described above with respect to effectively
connected interest; or

    - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of
that disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case, unless an applicable income tax
treaty provides otherwise, you will generally be subject to a 30% United States federal income tax on
any gain recognized, which may be offset by certain United States source losses.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders. In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest on_**
the notes and the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a note
paid to you, unless in each case you establish that you are an exempt recipient, such as a corporation. Backup
withholding may apply to any payments described in the preceding sentence if you fail to provide your taxpayer
identification number and a certification that you are not subject to backup withholding, or if you fail to report in full
your interest and dividend income.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Non-U.S. Holders. Generally, the amount of interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld_**
with respect to those payments will be reported to the IRS. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest
payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside
under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of interest on the notes
made to you, provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that
you are a United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has received from you the
statement described above in the fifth bullet point under “—Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders—
United States Federal Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds
of a sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of notes within the United States or
conducted through certain United States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the payor under
penalties of perjury that you are a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know
that you are a United States person as defined under the Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a 30%
United States federal withholding tax may apply to any interest paid on the notes to a recipient (whether such
recipient is the beneficial owner of the notes or, instead, an intermediary) that is (i) a “foreign financial institution”
(as specifically defined in the Code) that does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with
FATCA (which may alternatively be in the form of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the
United States) in a manner that avoids withholding, or (ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in
the Code) that does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either


-----

(x) an exemption from FATCA, or (y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States beneficial
owners of such entity (if any). If an interest payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the
withholding tax discussed above under “Certain Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders—United States Federal
Withholding Tax,” an applicable withholding agent may credit the withholding under FATCA against, and therefore
reduce, such other withholding tax. While withholding under FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross
proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of the notes, proposed United States Treasury regulations (upon
which taxpayers may rely until final regulations are issued) eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross
proceeds entirely. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant
to your ownership and disposition of the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes
by (a) “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA that are subject to Title I of ERISA,
(b) plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code or
provisions under any Similar Laws, and (c) entities whose underlying assets are considered to include assets of any
of the foregoing described in clause (a) or (b) (each of the foregoing described in clauses (a) (b), and (c) referred to
as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA (an “ERISA Plan”) or Section 4975 of the Code (together with an ERISA Plan, a “Covered Plan”) and
prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties.
Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration
of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders
investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary
of the Covered Plan.

Non-U.S. plans, U.S. governmental plans and certain U.S. church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
(as discussed below), may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult
with their counsel before purchasing the notes (or any interest therein) to determine the suitability of the notes for
such plan and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar
Laws.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Furthermore, each Plan should consider that none of us,
the initial purchasers or any of our or their respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the
decision to invest in the notes in connection with the initial offering of the notes and is not undertaking to provide
investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity with respect to such investment.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.
A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to
excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the Covered
Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under
ERISA and/or the Code.

The purchase and/or holding of notes (including any interest therein) by a Covered Plan with respect to
which the issuer, the sponsor, an initial purchaser, or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified
person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or
Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and held in accordance with an applicable statutory,
class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued
prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may apply to the purchase and holding of the notes (or
interest therein). These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined
by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate
accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company
general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, the
statutory exemptions under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provides relief from


-----

certain prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain
transactions between a Covered Plan and a person who is a party in interest or disqualified person solely as a result
of providing services to such Covered Plan or a relationship to such a service provider, provided that neither the
person transacting with the Covered Plan nor any of its affiliates has or exercises any discretionary authority or
control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of the Covered Plan involved in the transaction
and provided, further, that the Covered Plan pays no more than, and receives no less than, adequate consideration in
connection with the transaction. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its
application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans considering purchasing and/or holding the notes (or interest therein) in
reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to ensure it is applicable. There can
be no assurance that all of the conditions of any of the foregoing exemptions or any other exemption will be satisfied
with respect to transactions involving the notes.

Because of the foregoing, the notes (including any interest in a note) should not be purchased or held by
any person investing assets of any Plan unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note (including any interest in a note), each purchaser and subsequent
transferee of a note (or any interest therein) will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no
portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee of a note (or any interest therein) to purchase or hold the
notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase, holding and subsequent disposition
of the notes (or any interest therein) by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation under any applicable
Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it
is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes (or any
interest in a note) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Neither this discussion nor anything
provided in this offering memorandum is, or is intended to be, investment advice directed at any potential Plan
purchasers, or at Plan purchasers generally, and such purchasers of the notes should consult and rely on their own
counsel and advisers as to whether such an investment is suitable for the Plan. The sale of any of the notes to any
Plan is in no respect a representation by us, the initial purchasers or any of our or their affiliates or representatives
that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any
particular Plan, or that such investment is prudent or appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.
Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the notes
complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of
ERISA or the Code or provisions of any Similar Laws.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is acting as the representative of the several initial purchasers in connection
with the offering of the notes. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement dated the date
of this offering memorandum, the initial purchasers have severally agreed to purchase from the issuer and the
guarantors, and the issuer and the guarantors have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, the notes.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to purchase the notes are
subject to customary closing conditions. The initial purchasers must purchase all the notes if they purchase any of
the notes. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the
non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated.

The offering of the notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the
initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The issuer and the guarantors have agreed to
indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to
contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The respective initial purchasers propose to resell the respective notes at the offering prices set forth on the
cover page of this offering memorandum within the United States to persons reasonably believed to be qualified
institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in reliance on
Regulation S. See “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.” The price at which the notes are offered may be
changed at any time without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and
may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in
Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. See “Notice to Investors; Transfer Restrictions.”

In addition, with respect to the notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with
Regulation S, until 40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States
by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities
Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration
under the Securities Act.

We have agreed that, for a period of 45 days from the date of this offering memorandum, we will not,
without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, or announce the offering of, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by us. Goldman Sachs
& Co. LLC in its sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time
without notice.

The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. The issuer does not
intend to list the notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. We cannot assure you that the
prices at which the notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or
that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. The initial purchasers have
advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and
they may discontinue any market making activities with respect to the notes at any time without notice. Accordingly,
we cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or the trading market for, the notes.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes
and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market.
Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing
purchases. Short sales involve secondary market sales by the initial purchasers of a greater number of notes than
they are required to purchase in the offering. Covering transactions involve purchases of notes in the open market


-----

after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to
purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Purchases to cover short positions
and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own accounts, may have the
effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. They may also cause the price of the
notes to be higher than the price that would otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions.
The initial purchasers may conduct these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the initial
purchasers commence any of these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The initial purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, corporate advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers
and/or their respective affiliates have in the past performed commercial banking, investment banking and advisory
services for us and our affiliates from time to time for which they have received customary fees and reimbursement
of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services for us and our affiliates in
the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and reimbursement of expenses. In
the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may make
or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (which may include bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for
the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments.
Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates.
Furthermore, certain of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may, from time to time, enter into armslength transactions with us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of their business.

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are agents, arrangers and/or lenders under
senior revolving credit facilities and the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and, in each case, they have received, or
they will be entitled to receive, customary fees and reimbursement of certain expenses in connection therewith, as
applicable, and will receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering in connection with the Refinancing
Transactions. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be holders of the
2026 Notes, which are being redeemed with the proceeds of this offering, and as a result, such initial purchasers
and/or their respective affiliates may therefore receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering.

The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Certain of the
initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge, and certain other of the
initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us may hedge, their credit exposure to us
consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical such hedging strategy would include these
initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading in our
securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor” as defined
in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling
the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the
PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in any
member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the


-----

requirement to publish a prospectus for offer of the notes. This offering memorandum is not to be considered a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation and any relevant implementing measure in each member
state of the EEA.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No.
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”);
(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended,
the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive,

part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in the United
Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from a
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

only at (i) persons who are “investment professionals” falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Order”), (ii) high net worth companies,
unincorporated associations and other bodies within the categories described in Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order
and (iii) any other persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of the notes may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).

be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the
notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the issuer or the
guarantors; and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES**

_The following is a brief description of certain insolvency law considerations in England and Wales which is_
_the jurisdiction in which the Parent Guarantor is incorporated. The descriptions below do not purport to be_
_complete or discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the notes or the guarantees. In the event_
_that the Parent Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which_
_jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such_
_proceedings. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which_
_jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment_
_in full under the notes and the guarantees. Prospective investors in the notes should consult their own legal advisors_
_with respect to such limitations and considerations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the_
_Notes—Enforcing your rights as a holder of the notes or under the guarantees across multiple jurisdictions may be_
_difficult.”_

**England and Wales**

**_Applicability of English insolvency laws_**

Gates Industrial Holdco Limited, as the Parent Guarantor, is incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales (the “English Obligor”).

Note that Scotland and Northern Ireland are separate jurisdictions and appropriate advice should be
obtained wherever Scottish or Northern Irish debtors or assets are involved.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that the English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the notes are
guaranteed by the guarantee of the English Obligor. English insolvency laws and related considerations could affect
the enforceability of the guarantee of the notes by the English Obligor.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations.
The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights in respect of the
principal, interest and other amounts owing by the English Obligor under the guarantees of the notes and therefore
may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the English Obligor.

**_Insolvency law_**

While the UK was a member state of the EU, insolvency processes opened in the UK were subject to both
EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 and the
expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020, in accordance with
European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)
EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was
transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit)
Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously
directly applicable in the UK, including the Insolvency Regulation 2000 and EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on
Insolvency Proceedings (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), and domestic insolvency laws, including the
Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) (the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI
2016/1024) (as amended) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI
2006/1030) (as amended) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”).

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation
govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligor would likely proceed under, and
be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings.


-----

However, to the extent that the English Obligor has its center of main interests (“COMI”) in a member state of the
EU, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be
opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant to
the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency
proceedings of any English Obligor that has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it
carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction.

Should the English Obligor have its COMI in a jurisdiction that is not within the UK, and insolvency
proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened
in England and Wales would be limited to the assets of the relevant company that are located in Great Britain. Upon
recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory
liquidation (see below), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in Great Britain, including
commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic
stay will not affect a creditor’s rights to enforce security over the debtor’s property (albeit such a stay may be
requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies upon recognition of foreign non main proceedings
(albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court).

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect
of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark)
and an “establishment” in the UK. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company
carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over
certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will
significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other
jurisdictions (see “Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings” below).

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings with respect to an English company should be commenced in
England based on English insolvency laws; although insolvency proceedings in respect of English companies could
also be based in other jurisdictions under certain circumstances.

**_Insolvency_**

Under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act, a company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is
insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (which is deemed to be the case if, among other things, it is proved to the
satisfaction of the court that it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, if the company fails to satisfy a creditor’s
statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 3 weeks of service or if it fails to satisfy in full a judgment debt
(or similar court order)) or “balance sheet” basis (i.e., it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the
company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective
liabilities).

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways,
including by (i) the company, its directors, or one or more of its creditors making an application for an
administration order, (ii) the company, its directors, or certain creditors (discussed below) appointing administrators
out of court, or (iii) a creditor filing a petition to wind-up the English company or the company resolving to wind
itself up (in the case of liquidation) (see “—Liquidation/ Winding-Up” below).

**_Administration_**

English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of any
company within their general jurisdiction (see “Insolvency law” above), any company incorporated in England,
Wales, Scotland or an EEA State (being any state that is a Contracting Party to the Agreement on the European
Economic Area signed at Oporto on May 2, 1992 as adjusted by the Protocol signed at Brussels on March 17, 1993),
any company (irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other
than Denmark) and upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or certain other countries and
territories. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is


-----

satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration
order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration, which must be one of the statutory objectives
(described below).

An administrator can also be appointed out of court by the company, its directors or the holder of a
qualifying floating charge, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the person making the
appointment. To constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which
(a) states that the relevant statutory provisions apply to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an
administrator in respect of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver
within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The holder of the qualifying floating charge may
appoint an administrator if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates
to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the company and at least one such security interest is a
qualifying floating charge. It is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or
substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a
company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (1) the rescue of
the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the primary objective);
(2) the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company
were wound up (without first being in administration) (the secondary objective); or (3) the realization of some or all
of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (the tertiary
objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order, unless he thinks either
that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a
better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. Therefore, the administrator cannot pursue the tertiary objective
unless he thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the primary objective or the secondary
objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue
the tertiary objective.

An administrator owes his or her duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. An administrator is
given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain
requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property
subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of any property subject to a floating
charge will need to be set aside for satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring- fencing of the
Prescribed Part (see “Priority on Insolvency” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court,
deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of
the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon
the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security
over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court (although a
demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent
or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution,
distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider
discretionary factors in determining any application for permission in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of
administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an
administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet
taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier
of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is
proposed to be appointed by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator
is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors).

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to
realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by
virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally,


-----

a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and
credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (“FCARs”).

If the English Obligor were to enter administration, a demand for payment could be made under the
guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against it in connection therewith without
the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. There can be no assurance that such consent or
permission would be obtained.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is an asset realization and distribution procedure under which the assets of the company (to the
extent that they are not subject to any fixed security interest) are realized and distributed by the liquidator to
creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act, with any surplus paid to the
shareholders. At the end of the liquidation process the company will normally be dissolved.

Liquidation proceedings may be opened where: (i) the company is registered in England and Wales or
Scotland; (ii) the debtor’s COMI is in the UK; or (iii) the debtor’s COMI is in an EU member state and there is an
establishment in the UK. The English courts can also open compulsory liquidation (see below) in respect of foreign
companies as unregistered companies if such foreign company has a sufficient connection to England and Wales and
(A) there is a reasonable possibility, if a winding-up order is made, of benefit to those applying for the winding-up
order and (B) one or more persons interested in the distribution of assets of the company is a person over whom the
courts can exercise jurisdiction.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’
voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save
where it follows an administration). The difference between the two voluntary liquidation proceedings is the
solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company must swear
a statutory declaration that the company will be able to pay its debts in full, together with any applicable interest,
within a period not exceeding 12 months from the commencement of the winding up. In comparison, the primary
ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts. Note that
while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the
members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas
compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with
sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see “Insolvency
Law” above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England,
Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up.
In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s
property, any transfer of the company’s shares, and any altering of the status of company members, made after the
commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any
property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral
arrangement” under the FCARs and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with
its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is
deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition.

Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be
imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the
court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up
order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of
Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up, it is for the
liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, if a stay is
not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can go ahead and initiate proceedings against the company (and/or
enforce their security).


-----

A liquidator has the power, among other things, to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the
company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the
company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions
(see “Avoidance of Transactions” below).

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator also has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving
a prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any
other property of the company which is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give rise to a liability
to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it imposes continuing financial
obligations on the company which may be regarded as detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable
merely because it is financially disadvantageous, or because the company could have made, or could make, a better
bargain. However, this power does not apply to a contract that has already been substantially performed, nor can it
be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to
any financial collateral arrangement where the collateral provider or collateral taker under the arrangement is subject
to winding-up proceedings. Any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of any disclaimer is deemed to be a
creditor of the company and is entitled to prove for the loss or damage as a debt in the winding-up.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going
concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in
question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different
classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of
priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part, distributions generally cannot be made to a
class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors
have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are
distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being
taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net
balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or
distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on
which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency
set-off is effectively to afford the creditor with a potential super priority status to the extent of the amount owed by
that creditor to the company, in that it receives full value for an equivalent amount of its claim against the company
(in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that
element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and
debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite
degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency
set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of set-off, including contractual setoff, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies).

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will generally
be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the
benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge
realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap
of £800,000 (such cap being effected by the Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) (Amendment) Order 2020)
(except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating
charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part
must be made and distributed to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the
resulting benefits (and, if the floating charge realizations exceed £10,000, the court grants an order on the
application of the insolvency officeholder on this basis). The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall
claims of secured creditors.


-----

The requirement for an administrator, liquidator or receiver (including administrative receiver) to set aside
a prescribed part of the company’s property which is subject to a floating charge, and make it available for
unsecured creditors, will not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral
arrangement (as described in the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as
amended)), as set out below.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

_First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent that the value of the secured assets is_
less than or equal to the value of the secured debt) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession
(but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary
interest only;

_Second ranking: where a company exits a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and within the_
subsequent 12 weeks enters into administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium debts (any debt or liability
that falls due during or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it) and any priority premoratorium debts (largely comprising pre-moratorium debts for which the company did not have a payment holiday,
save for financial debt accelerated during the moratorium), as well as any prescribed fees or expenses of the official
receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company. The relevant types of debt do not rank equally and there
are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which they are paid;

_Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of_
priority in which expenses are paid);

_Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation
to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done
in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any
employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of
insolvency; and (d) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (the “FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts
rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts and
include: (a) bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that such
claims exceed the statutory limit; and (b) VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386
and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 to the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank
equally;

_Fifth ranking: provable debts of unsecured creditors to the extent of the Prescribed Part only, unless the_
cost of distributing the same would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors;

_Sixth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would_
include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper
interpretation by the court, was re-characterized as a floating charge;

_Seventh ranking:_

**firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured**
creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the
relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder
can only use realizations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the
Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor
elects to surrender its security;


-----

**secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate**
and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any
period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been
converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the
Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations
from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

**thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and**
therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This, however, does not
include “currency conversion” claims following English Supreme Court’s ruling dated May 17, 2017 on the Lehman
Brothers case; and

_Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds_
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their debts,
any debt of a company payable in a currency other than pound sterling must be converted into pound sterling at a
single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the
relevant date (i.e., the date (i) the company went into liquidation (or, if the liquidation was immediately preceded by
an administration, on the date when the company entered administration); or (ii) the company went into
administration (or, if the administration was immediately preceded by a winding up, on the date when the company
went into liquidation)). This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. A creditor who considers that
the rate determined by the office-holder is unreasonable may apply to court and, if the court finds that the rate is
unreasonable, the court may itself determine the exchange rate to be used.

Accordingly, in the event that the English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the
notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the English Obligor goes into liquidation or
administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the notes may become entitled. Any losses
resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Avoidance of transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
guarantees (amongst other corporate actions) can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is
placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the guarantee. Therefore, if
during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or
liquidator may challenge the validity of the guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by
the company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action (including their
proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it.

The issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as
described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a guarantee in respect of the notes would
not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

_Onset of insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences (as
discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question.


-----

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c)
otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset
of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the
date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of
insolvency for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences will be as for the initial administration.

_Connected persons_

If a given transaction at an undervalue or preference has been entered into by the company with a
“connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an
administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A connected person, for these purposes, is a party who is a director, shadow director, an associate of such
director or shadow director, or an associate, of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they
are (a) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (b) a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner, or (c) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of (i) the individual or (ii) the
individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if employed by that company and
for these purposes any director or other officer of a company is to be treated as employed by that company. A person
is an associate of any person with whom he is in partnership, and of the husband, wife or civil partner or a relative of
any individual with whom he is in partnership. In certain circumstances a person in his capacity as trustee may be an
associate of a person that is a beneficiary, or an associate of the beneficiary.

A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a
person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control
of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company, and the groups either consist of the
same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of
either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or
instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any
general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together
satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply under English law to guarantees:

_Transactions at an undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company (or an assignee of the
relevant right of action) could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a guarantee (or grant other
relief) if they believe that the creation of such guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction
might be a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes a gift to a person, if the company receives no
consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than
the consideration given by such company.

Such a transaction can only be challenged on this basis if (i) at the time of the transaction or as a
consequence of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in the
Insolvency Act) and (ii) if the guarantee was granted within the period of two years ending with the onset of
insolvency.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator (or the assignee of the right of action) to
demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless the transaction was entered into by the
company with a connected person (as defined in the Insolvency Act), in which case it will be presumed that the
company was insolvent and the connected person must demonstrate the contrary in such proceedings.


-----

In any case, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in
good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable
grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such
order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into
(which could include reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside any guarantees, although there is
protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value). An order by
the court may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with
whom the company entered into the transaction. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest
deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good
faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) except where that person was a
party to the transaction or the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they
were a creditor of the company.

_Preferences_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator (or an assignee of the relevant right of action)
could apply to the court for an order to set aside payments or the creation of a guarantee (or grant other relief) where
such payment or guarantee constituted a preference.

A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the
transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of
the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the company’s insolvency is within a period of
six months (if the beneficiary of the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a
connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s
employee) from the date the company grants the guarantee.

A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the
company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of
the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in
had that transaction not been entered into. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which
entered into the transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position in relation to that person
when taking their decision.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its
debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of
the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being
the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the
connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to
restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include
reducing payments due under or setting aside guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the
property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was
given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the
company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a
person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or
administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a
time when they were a creditor of the company.


-----

_Transactions defrauding creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it
was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a
claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim
which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding
creditors. An application to the court for an order to set aside the transaction may be made by any appointed
administrator or liquidator, the supervisor of any relevant company voluntary arrangement or, subject to certain
conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions
Regulator. In addition, any person who is, or who is capable of being, prejudiced by the transaction may (with the
leave of the court in the case of a company in administration or liquidation) also bring an application to set aside
such transaction. There is no time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to normal statutory
limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of or as a result of the
transaction, or in administration or liquidation for the provision to apply.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such
order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and
to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting
aside guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person
whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not
prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for
value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from
such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the
liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate credit transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator of an English company (or an assignee of the relevant right of action) can
apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to the
risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant
payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit
or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

Where an administrator or liquidator (or their assignee) makes an application to set aside a transaction on
this basis, it is presumed that the transaction is or was extortionate unless otherwise proved. A transaction can only
be challenged as an extortionate credit transaction if the company enters into liquidation or administration within
three years after the date of the transaction. The court may make an order to set aside, either in whole or in part, any
obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the
transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the
transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator (or their assignee) sums already paid under the transaction and
it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no
provisions for the protection of third-parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g.,
assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts
have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise or arrangement between a company
and its creditors (or any class of its creditors) in respect of the company’s obligations to those creditors. The English
Obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign obligor which (a) is
liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also
pursue a scheme, provided it can be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the scheme of arrangement would be
recognized in the jurisdictions in which the company has its main assets or operations. In practice, a foreign company
is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other
things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed or the
company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law.


-----

Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not
necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending
on the existing rights of such creditors against the scheme company and any new rights that such creditors are given
under or in connection with the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a
majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of
each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds
contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court and delivery of the
court’s sanction order to the Registrar of Companies) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected
creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review, amongst other things, whether all relevant
procedural requirements have been met, whether those voting fairly represented the interests of those entitled to
vote, and whether the scheme is objectively reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the
scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme.
The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration. A
scheme of arrangement can often involve the release or variation of guarantees and other closely connected claims
against third-parties in order to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings. A company may,
however, propose a scheme of arrangement while subject to a Part A1 Moratorium which may remain in place until
sanctioning of the scheme.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a corporate law process under Part 26A of the
Companies Act 2006 which allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a
company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors).

Unlike a scheme of arrangement, a “cross-class cram-down” power is available in a restructuring plan that
can be used to bind one or more dissenting classes of stakeholders (not only a dissenting minority within a class) to
the proposed restructuring plan. Like a scheme, the new standalone restructuring plan is available to any company
that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act with a sufficient connection to the UK, save that the Secretary
of State may by secondary legislation exclude certain types of company (including, in particular, financial market
participants) from time to time. In most situations, the company itself will propose the restructuring plan but its
members or creditors may also do so (as can an administrator or liquidator appointed to the company).

Unlike a scheme, there is a further threshold condition that the company must: (i) have encountered, or be
likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a
going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members for the purpose of
eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. Although the “financial difficulties” test
falls short of requiring the company to be, or likely to become, insolvent (i.e. unable to pay its debts within the
meaning of Section 123 of the Insolvency Act), recent case law indicates that restructuring plans (unlike schemes)
will be considered as insolvency proceedings for the purposes of the Lugano Convention.

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan
must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or
members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders
and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme, it is for the proponent
to determine whether the creditors and/or members should be divided into multiple classes, and the same class
composition test applies. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement
must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they
have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant
alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the


-----

restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors whose rights are not being compromised under the
restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for
excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has
jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the
proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied
by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company.

The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the meeting(s) of the relevant creditors’ and/or
members (or classes thereof), and approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members, or
class of creditors or members, present and voting either in person or by proxy, vote in favor of it. In contrast to a
scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Where
a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium, any creditors in
respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” may not participate in the vote and may not be
compromised under the plan without their consent.

Following the meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary
plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to
sanction a plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of
it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if:

(i) the court is satisfied that no member of the dissenting class(es) would be worse off if the
restructuring plan were sanctioned than they would be in the “relevant alternative” (i.e. what the
court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario were the plan not sanctioned); and

(ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of
creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the
company, in the event of that “relevant alternative” scenario.

Even if both of these threshold conditions have been met, the court will not necessarily sanction the
relevant plan. One key factor relevant to the exercise by the court of its discretion in this regard is the fairness of the
plan, taking into account (amongst other things) the treatment of different creditors under the plan, and the division
of its benefits between them, by reference to the “relevant alternative” scenario.

A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they voted in
favor of it or not. The court’s sanction order will have no effect until delivered to Companies House for registration
(or, in the case of an overseas company not otherwise required to register particulars, published in the Gazette).

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically
trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings but a company may propose a restructuring plan while subject to a
Part A1 Moratorium. Any such Part A1 Moratorium may remain in place until sanctioning of the restructuring plan.

**_Company voluntary arrangement_**

English courts are empowered to oversee company voluntary arrangements in respect of companies within
their general jurisdiction (see “Insolvency Law” above) and companies incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or
an EEA State or with their respective COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark).

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as
applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a
compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reduction of the
company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors (by way of decision
procedure) and shareholders (subject to the below), it will bind all unsecured creditors who were or would have been
entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to
enforce its security, except with its consent. A company voluntary arrangement also cannot affect the rights of a


-----

preferential creditor to be paid in priority to non-preferential creditors, or to be paid on an unequal basis relative to
other preferential creditors, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75%
(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. A simple majority of the company’s members must also have voted in
favor of the proposal. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement but a secured creditor may
vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who votes in the company voluntary arrangement for
the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. As noted above, the company’s shareholders will
also vote on the company voluntary arrangement. However, if the decision of the creditors differs from the decision
of the shareholders, the former will prevail unless a shareholder applies to court within 28 days and the court orders
that the decision of the shareholders should prevail.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a company voluntary arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium with respect to security enforcement or legal proceedings. A company may,
however, enter into a Part A1 Moratorium prior to or while undergoing a company voluntary arrangement process
which will terminate upon creditor approval of the proposed arrangement.

**_Limitations on enforcement_**

_Constitutional documents, corporate benefit and financial assistance_

The grant of a guarantee by any of the English Obligor in respect of the obligations of another group company
must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed by the
respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such
an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights
unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the English Obligor in good
faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for the English Obligor by virtue of entering into the
proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he
considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members
as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be
found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.
Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to
consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when
directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or
should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning
“probable”.

Guarantees granted by the English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they
would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

_Amendments_

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a
guarantee or other suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship
relates without further reference to the guarantor or surety.

_Enforcement_

Enforcement of guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the legality,
validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including
guarantees).


-----

_Moratoria_

The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 introduced a new standalone moratorium under Part
A1 of the Insolvency Act to provide companies with a short period of breathing space within which to seek rescue
options.

Subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions, any company that is liable to be wound up
under the Insolvency Act is eligible for a moratorium. Ineligible companies include certain financial services
companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitization companies as well as parties to capital
market arrangements under which a party has incurred or expects to incur a debt of at least £10 million (at any time
during the life of the arrangement), including issuers of rated, listed or traded bonds). Ineligible companies also
include any company that is subject to an insolvency procedure or which has entered into a moratorium,
administration or company voluntary arrangement in the preceding twelve months (unless the court orders
otherwise). The Parent Guarantor is likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of
the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded
from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from
time to time.

Subject to what follows, directors of any eligible non-overseas company may commence a moratorium by
filing the requisite papers at court. Directors must apply to court to commence a moratorium for any eligible
company that is subject to a winding-up petition, whereupon the court will consider whether a moratorium will
result in a better outcome for creditors as a whole than if the company were wound up without one. Directors of any
eligible overseas company must also apply to the court to commence a moratorium.

Both in- and out-of-court processes require a statement from the directors of the company that, in their
view, the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts. Furthermore, a monitor, who is an insolvency
practitioner appointed to oversee the moratorium, must separately confirm (among others) that the moratorium
would likely result in the rescue of the company as a going concern. This is an ongoing requirement in order for a
moratorium to continue; indeed, a monitor must terminate the moratorium if, at any time, it becomes apparent that
the company is unlikely to be rescued as a going concern.

A company subject to a moratorium has the benefit of a payment holiday in relation to certain debts
incurred prior to the commencement of the moratorium. However, certain other debts, including those which arise
under a contract or other instrument involving financial services (which would include capital market arrangements)
entered into or incurred prior to the moratorium, are exempted from payment holidays and such liabilities are
therefore required to be met as and when they fall due. If the monitor thinks that the company is unable to pay such
liabilities, plus any debt incurred during the moratorium, which arise or become payable during the moratorium he
or she will be compelled to end the moratorium.

During a moratorium, creditors are restricted from taking enforcement measures against the company,
including commencing insolvency and other legal proceedings and enforcing security without the permission of the
monitor or the court (and an application to court for such permission may not be made for the purpose of enforcing
any pre-moratorium debt for which the company has a payment holiday). The Act includes a carve-out for
enforcement of security financial collateral or the taking of any step to enforce a collateral security charge, which
are permitted. In contrast to a moratorium arising from an administration, a floating charge may not be crystallized
during this new moratorium, nor may any restrictions on the disposal of a floating charge asset be imposed.

Costs incurred during a moratorium will be treated in a similar way to expenses in an administration.
Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently enters into administration or liquidation within a 12-week
period, any unpaid moratorium debts and any priority pre-moratorium debts, as well as any prescribed fees or
expenses of the official receiver acting in any capacity in relation to the company, will have super-priority over any
costs or claims in the administration or liquidation (except for claims of fixed charge creditors to the extent such
creditors can be paid out of the assets charged and any fees and expenses of the official receiver).


-----

Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the
company’s activities are subject to oversight by the monitor. In addition, the company may not enter into certain
transactions without the consent of the monitor (which the monitor may only give if they think that the relevant
transaction will support the rescue of the company as a going concern). These include granting new security, making
payments in respect of pre-moratorium debts for which the company has a payment holiday (unless the maximum
total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at
the start of the moratorium), and disposals of property outside the ordinary course.

A moratorium will last for an initial period of 20 business days beginning with the business day after the
day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended for a further 20 business days by the
directors of the company. Where an extension is proposed, statements from the directors and the monitor must be
filed with the court confirming that certain qualifying conditions continue to be met (repetition by the directors and
monitor of statements with respect to the insolvency of the company and prospects of rescue, respectively, and
confirmation that all moratorium debts and pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment
holiday have been paid or discharged). Further extensions (beyond 40 business days) will be available:

    - pursuant to an out-of-court filing for a period of up to one year from commencement (but with the
possibility of multiple extensions), if more than 50% (by value) of secured creditors and more than
50% (by value) of unsecured creditors vote in favor of the extension, unless more than 50% (by
number) of unconnected secured creditors or unsecured creditors vote against the extension. Only
creditors with pre-moratorium debt in respect of which the company has a payment holiday, which has
fallen due or may fall due before the proposed revised end date of the moratorium, will have the right
to vote;

    - pursuant to an application by the directors to court for such period as the court sees fit;

    - automatically in connection with a company voluntary arrangement until the proposal is implemented,
accepted or rejected by creditors or withdrawn by the company; and

    - at the court’s discretion in connection with a scheme of arrangement or restructuring plan (but with the
moratorium terminating upon court sanction of the scheme or plan).

_Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_

Further recent changes to the Insolvency Act have introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of
ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing
insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts
which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic
termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an
insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a
‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement,
liquidation and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the
relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants
permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the
provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees,
contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of,
arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in
the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the
“Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain,
where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of
certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if COMI of the
relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI is determined to be
in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain). The nature and scope of the recognition
will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in
question. The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency
proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has
its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has
only an establishment.

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and
restructuring plans will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings
and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 and the
Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the UK’s pending accession to the latter) where these apply. In addition,
recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area
of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating
to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention
and the Lugano Convention or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency proceedings and fall within related
exceptions to such treaties (the one English case to date in which this point has been considered adopted the latter
position).

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no
longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms
agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK
insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border
insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and
increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic
for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and for UK office holders to
effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and
recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need
may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs, a small number of EU
member states have adopted the Model Law which will likely assist recognition of an English process in such
jurisdictions. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK
domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other
EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I
may offer an alternative basis for recognition in Member States.


-----

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member
state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and
whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.
