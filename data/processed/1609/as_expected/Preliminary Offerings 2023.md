**_“notes”). The notes will bear interest at a rate of      % per annum. The Issuer will pay interest on the notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on      and      of each_**
**_year, beginning on     , 2023. The notes will mature on     , 2030._**

**_This offering is part of the financing for the proposed acquisition of Cvent Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Cvent”), by certain investment funds affiliated with_**
**_Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone”) and a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (“ADIA” and together with Blackstone, the “Sponsors”), pursuant to an agreement_**
**_and plan of merger, dated as of March 14, 2023 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Issuer, Capstone Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a Delaware corporation_**
**_and wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer, and Cvent. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated therein (collectively_**
**_referred to as the “Merger”), Merger Sub will be merged with and into Cvent, with Cvent surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer. Concurrently with the_**
**_consummation of the Merger, (i) Cvent will assume all of the obligations of Merger Sub under its guarantee of the notes by operation of law and (ii) each of Cvent’s subsidiaries_**
**_that will guarantee the Issuer’s New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined herein) will join as guarantors to the notes offered hereby. Upon the closing of this offering,_**
**_or upon release of the funds from the segregated escrow account if this offering is not consummated simultaneously with the Closing, we intend to use the net proceeds from_**
**_this offering or the funds from such segregated escrow account, together with borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and cash and equity contributions_**
**_by the Sponsors to (i) finance the consummation of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including amounts payable thereunder, (ii)_**
**_repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under Cvent’s existing credit facility (the “Existing Credit Facility”), (iii) provide cash on hand to the Issuer and (iv) pay related_**
**_fees, costs, premiums and expenses in connection with these transactions (we refer to this offering, the entry into and borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit_**
**_Facilities, the Merger and the other transactions described in this sentence collectively as the “Transactions”). See “Summary—The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.”_**

**_Unless the Merger is consummated simultaneously with this offering, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from the offering of the notes into_**
**_a segregated escrow account for the benefit of the holders of the notes. The release of the escrowed funds will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined herein)_**
**_set forth in the Escrow Agreement (as defined herein). If the consummation of the Merger does not occur on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined herein) or if the Issuer_**
**_notifies the Escrow Agent (as defined herein) that in its reasonable judgment the Merger will not be consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or that the Merger Agreement_**
**_has been terminated, the Issuer must redeem the notes on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein) at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined_**
**_herein), pursuant to the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”_**

**_At any time prior to     , 2026, the Issuer may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed,_**
**_plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time on or after,      2026, the Issuer may_**
**_redeem some or all of the notes at the applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the_**
**_redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to     , 2026, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes with an amount not to exceed_**
**_the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the applicable redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but_**
**_excluding, the redemption date. In addition, at any time on or after       , 2024 and prior to          , 2026, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the_**
**_notes with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from any Qualified IPO (as defined herein) at the applicable redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum,_**
**_plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”_**

**_Prior to the consummation of the Merger and pending satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, if applicable, the notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by_**
**_Capstone Intermediate, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the direct parent of the Issuer (“Parent”), and Merger Sub and will be secured only by an exclusive senior-priority_**
**_lien on the escrow account and the funds held in the escrow account relating to the notes. Upon the consummation of the Merger, from and after the satisfaction of the Escrow_**
**_Release Conditions, if applicable, the notes will be guaranteed (the “guarantees”), jointly and severally, by Parent and each of the Issuer’s wholly-owned domestic restricted_**
**_subsidiaries (including Cvent) that guarantee our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (Parent and such subsidiary guarantors collectively, the “guarantors”). Upon the_**
**_consummation of the Merger, from and after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, if applicable, the notes and related guarantees will be secured by substantially_**
**_all assets of the Issuer and the guarantors which assets will also secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities on an_**
**_equal priority basis, subject to certain limitations and exceptions and permitted liens. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes.” Upon the consummation of the_**
**_Merger, from and after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, if applicable, the notes and related guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of the_**
**_Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior indebtedness, without giving effect to collateral arrangements, and effectively equal to all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior_**
**_indebtedness secured on the same priority basis as the notes, including our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The notes and the related guarantees will be effectively_**
**_subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ indebtedness that is secured by assets that do not constitute collateral for the notes to the extent of the value of the_**
**_assets securing such indebtedness. The notes and the related guarantees will be effectively senior to any of the Issuer’s and guarantors’ unsecured indebtedness, to the extent_**
**_of the value of the assets securing the notes. The notes and the related guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock_**
**_and other liabilities of any subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a guarantor of the notes._**

**Investing in the notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 30.**

**Offering price of the notes:   %, plus accrued interest, if any from    , 2023.**

_The notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other_
_jurisdiction. The notes are being offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act_
_(“Rule 144A”) and to certain non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective_
_purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby notified that the sellers of the notes may be relying on the exemption from Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to_
_Rule 144A. For a description of certain information about eligible offerees and restrictions on transfers of the notes, see “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan of Distribution.”_

_The notes and the guarantees will not be entitled to any registration rights and we will not be required to complete a registered exchange offer or shelf registration of the notes_
_and the guarantees._

_There is currently no public market for the notes. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system._

_The initial purchasers of the notes expect to deliver to investors the notes only in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) for the benefit_
_of its participants, including Euroclear Bank, S.A./N.V. and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, on or about    , 2023._

**Notice to Investors**

**The Issuer and the guarantors have not, and the initial purchasers and their affiliates and agents have**
**not, authorized any person to provide any information or represent anything about us other than what is**
**contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The Issuer and the guarantors do not,**
**and the initial purchasers and their affiliates and agents do not, take any responsibility for, and can provide no**
**assurance as to the reliability of, any information that others may provide to you. None of the Issuer, the**
**guarantors or the initial purchasers is making an offer to sell these notes in any jurisdiction where the offer or**
**sale is not permitted. The information contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum**
**speaks only as of the date of the document containing such information. Our business, financial condition,**
**liquidity, results of operations and prospects may have changed subsequent to any such date.**

It is expected that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover of this offering memorandum, which is the     business day following the date of pricing of the notes
(such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+    ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the
secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes prior to the date that is two business days
preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle in T+   , to


-----

specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the
notes who wish to trade the notes during such period should consult their own advisor.

This offering memorandum is highly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection

to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside

does not constitute an offer or solicitation of an offer from any other person or the public generally to subscribe for or
otherwise acquire the notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the offeree and those
persons, if any, retained to advise such offeree with respect thereto is unauthorized, and any disclosure of any of its

memorandum, in whole or in part. Each offeree, by accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, agrees to the
foregoing and to make no photocopies of this offering memorandum.

We have provided the information contained in this offering memorandum, including information

certificates relating to the notes will be shown on, and transfers of such global certificates will be effected only through,
records maintained by DTC and its direct and indirect participants. After the initial issuance of the global certificates,
notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the indenture that
will govern the notes. See “Book Entry, Delivery and Form.”

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional
information regarding the information contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also

prospective investor less than the full amount of notes sought by such investor.

Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this offering memorandum have been
subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables or charts may not be the
arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total
100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them.

**THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN RECOMMENDED BY ANY UNITED**
**STATES FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR REGULATORY AUTHORITY.**
**FURTHERMORE, THE FOREGOING AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THE ACCURACY OR**
**DETERMINED THE ADEQUACY OF THIS DOCUMENT. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE**

**No Review by the SEC; No Registration Rights**

This offering memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with this offering, will not be
reviewed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). There are no registration rights
associated with the notes or the guarantees and we have no present intention to offer to exchange the notes and the
guarantees for notes and guarantees registered under the Securities Act or to file a registration statement with respect
to the notes. The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

This offering memorandum and certain documents incorporated by reference herein use and discuss certain
financial measures not presented in accordance with GAAP, including Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted Cash EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash
Flow, Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital
Expenditures, and certain ratios derived therefrom. Cvent management believes that these non-GAAP measures of
financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business
trends relating to Cvent’s financial condition and results of operations. Cvent management uses these non-GAAP
measures for financial, operational and budgetary decision-making purposes, and to compare its performance to that
of prior periods for trend analyses. Cvent believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information
regarding past financial performance and future prospects, and permits it to more thoroughly analyze key financial
metrics used to make operational decisions. Cvent believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures
provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing
its financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures
to investors.

Cvent does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures
determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they
exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Cvent’s financial statements.
In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about
which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to
compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP
results.

For definitions of each of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial
measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, see “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma
Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”

**Business Overview**

Cvent is the leading cloud-based software platform of event marketing and management and hospitality
solutions. We support the marketing and management of meetings and events through our Event Cloud and Hospitality
Cloud solutions.

Our Event Cloud consists of software solutions and tools to enable event organizers to manage the entire
event lifecycle and deliver engaging experiences across every type of event and all event formats: in-person, virtual
and hybrid. Event Cloud serves as the system of record for event and engagement data collected across an
organization’s total event program, which comprises every internal and external event an organization hosts or attends
(“Total Event Program”). Our Hospitality Cloud includes Cvent Supplier Network (“CSN”), a marketplace that
connects event organizers looking for the appropriate event space for their in-person and hybrid events with hoteliers
and venue operators through a vertical search engine built on our proprietary database of detailed event space
information. In addition, our Hospitality Cloud provides software solutions that hotels and venues leverage to digitally
showcase their event space to attract valuable leads and grow their business, as well as tools that help our customers
manage group room blocks. This combination of our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud results in an integrated
solution that is mutually reinforcing.

Meetings and events are prevalent in organizations of almost every size, industry vertical and geography.
The meetings and events space encompasses a broad spectrum of external marketing events, such as customer events,
conferences, trade shows and prospect meetings; and internal events, such as sales kick-offs, training seminars, board
meetings, team-building activities and companywide gatherings. Collectively, organizations spent approximately $1
trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018, according to the Events Industry Council. According to a 2021 Frost
& Sullivan study we commissioned, the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our platform is $29.7 billion, across
our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions.


-----

Meetings and events are regarded as some of the most effective ways to build engagement and drive outcomes
with customers, employees and members. External events, whether conducted in-person or virtually, are critical to
sales and marketing efforts, as they represent opportunities for organizations to directly engage with their most
important external audiences. Events offer a highly effective way for organizations to maximize engagement
throughout the customer journey, helping them to generate and qualify leads, deepen relationships with customers and
build brand loyalty and advocacy. In addition, internal events aid in employee retention and development, as they
offer critical opportunities for human resources, training professionals and executive leadership to inspire and motivate
their employees through engaging experiences.

The ability to host events today across in-person, virtual and hybrid formats offers significant flexibility to
event planners and attendees and allows organizations to host more events with more registrants than ever before.
Organizations are also increasingly expanding their event technology spend given the increased complexity of their
Total Event Program. For event professionals, planning, marketing and executing an event is a highly complex
endeavor that can become inefficient and time-consuming when managed using traditional manual processes,
homegrown solutions or disparate point software solutions. This complexity is further exacerbated by the proliferation
of hybrid events, which essentially require planners to simultaneously execute two events that are consistent across
distinct event formats. With events throughout the customer journey now being held across various event types and
multiple event formats, organizations increasingly desire a single system of record – one platform – to collect and
analyze these interrelated account and attendee engagement data points and act on this data, as well as manage the
associated meetings spend, enabling them to measure the impact of, and return on, their events investment.

**_Event Cloud_**

We address the challenges faced by event organizers today through our end-to-end Event Cloud platform
featuring solutions to drive engagement and manage all event types and processes within an organization’s Total Event
Program. Prior to an event, event organizers use our platform to identify the appropriate venue via CSN, our
Hospitality Cloud product sold into hotels and venues; secure competitive proposals; diagram venue space to optimize
the event layout; secure speakers; build an event website; market the event; conduct pre-event surveys; coordinate
event logistics and produce broadcast-quality video content; automate expense approvals; and manage budgeting and
costs through integrations with other enterprise systems. During the course of an event, our platform enables event
marketers and planners to process registrations, check-in attendees, conduct sessions, broadcast sessions, facilitate
networking appointments, capture leads and manage on-going communication with attendees via an event-specific
mobile app. Following an event, exhibitors and sponsors can act on leads collected and scored via our platform and
provide registrants with access to on-demand video content, while event organizers can leverage our platform to
analyze registration, attendance, session data and survey responses to measure engagement, content effectiveness and
overall event success.

Our platform leverages specific engagement actions within our Event Cloud solution to generate an
engagement score for each attendee. When this data is integrated with an organization’s customer relationship
management (“CRM”) and marketing automation systems, it can boost existing lead scores and inform the optimal
next action such as sales follow up and marketing nurture campaigns. Cross-event analysis also enables organizations
to measure the effectiveness of the entirety of their Total Event Program. The ability of Event Cloud to provide
organizations with insights into buyer interests across the customer journey across all events has made the event
program even more strategic and has positioned our platform as a critical component of an organization’s marketing
technology stack.

**_Hospitality Cloud_**

Group business is a critical component of revenue and income for the hospitality industry. According to a
hotel industry data provider, group business can account for approximately one-third of hotel room nights; events also
have a high attach rate of ancillary revenue, including food and beverage, A/V and other equipment rental and
transportation services. We believe that as the hospitality industry continues to recover from the significant impact of
the pandemic, hoteliers and venues are actively seeking to drive group meeting business and are turning to digital
marketing tools and supporting software solutions, to market, sell and manage their event space, services and sleeping
rooms.


-----

Our CSN solution is a vertical online marketplace that allows event organizers to seamlessly solicit, receive
and manage multiple RFPs for event space (by connecting them directly to hotels and venues at no charge to the
organizers). Our platform helps hotels find event organizers and win group business by enabling them to digitally
showcase their event space and automate the RFP process, while also providing event organizers the tools needed to
search, diligence, negotiate and contract with hotels for event space. CSN connects approximately 109,000 meeting
and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our proprietary global database as of December
31, 2022. We believe the breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and extensiveness of its proprietary
database makes CSN a highly differentiated platform and well positioned in the industry. We believe that CSN
contains one of the world’s most extensive and accurate repositories of detailed meeting venue information,
empowering event organizers to search for, and qualify, potential event sites. We also believe that our marketplace
generates network effects that simultaneously increase the volume of requests for proposal (“RFPs”) submitted from
event organizers and increase the number of hospitality professionals using our system to respond to RFPs.

Our Hospitality Cloud also offers software solutions to hotels and venues that improve the group sales process
and streamline collaboration between hoteliers and event organizers to design, manage and execute events. Our
software solutions include, but are not limited to, lead scoring to prioritize group RFPs received via CSN, event
diagramming to collaborate with event organizers on designing optimal and safe event layouts and viewing threedimensional renderings, room block management that allows hotels and planners to work in concert to efficiently
manage guest room reservations and room blocks for events and enables event attendees to reserve hotel rooms,
business transient solutions that simplify how hotels attract, manage and win corporate travel business and business
intelligence solutions to benchmark against internal and targeted competitive metrics.

We sell our platform primarily through a direct inside sales team. For our Event Cloud, our customers enter
annual and multi-year subscriptions to utilize our cloud-based event marketing and management solutions. The
amount of these sum-certain contracts is contractually committed upfront based on the expected aggregate number of
registrants for all events across an organization’s Total Event Program in a given year. As of December 31, 2022, we
had approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers. For our Hospitality Cloud, hotels and venues enter into annual and
multi-year contracts for group business marketing solutions and software. As of December 31, 2022, we had
approximately 11,000 Hospitality Cloud customers.

We employ a land-and-expand business model, where customers grow their spend with us over time. As our
Event Cloud customers grow their Total Event Program by launching new types of events, running more events and
attracting additional registrants to their events, their contracts are typically renewed at higher annual values.
Additionally, customers purchasing our platform to replace certain homegrown or multiple disparate point solutions
may initially purchase only one or a few of our solutions. As those customers recognize the value of an integrated
platform, they typically expand their footprint over time. As of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, our net dollar retention rate was 115.1%, 113.9% and 101.0%, respectively. The increase in our net dollar
retention rate between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2023 is primarily due to the lessening impact of the global
COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and 2023 on both the Event and Hospitality Clouds, resulting in increased spend on
products supporting in-person events, in addition to the continued adoption of Attendee Hub, our solution for ongoing
attendee engagement and hybrid and virtual events.


-----

Our resilient business model has yielded strong results across all economic cycles and market conditions. For
the year ended December 31, 2020, during which the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a near-total pause on in-person
events, and a shift to virtual formats, our revenue decreased only 12% due to our sum-certain pricing model and multiyear contracts, despite not having a product catering to virtual formats at the start of the pandemic. As the meetings
and events industry continues its strong recovery from the pandemic, we have leveraged our comprehensive platform
to extend our industry leading position and delivered strong financial results. For the twelve-month period ending
March 31, 2023, the Company generated $659.4 million in revenue, representing 22.4% year-over-year growth, a Pro
Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA Margin of 33.6% and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures
Conversion of 73.0%. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial
Information— Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.”

**Industry Trends**

**_Event Cloud_**

**_Increased Importance of Meetings and Events to Chief Marketing and Chief Revenue Officers. Meetings_**
and events offer opportunities for organizations to engage directly with their customers for extended periods of time,
and as a result, can represent some of the most effective and highest value touchpoints along the entire customer
journey.

**_Increased Importance of Internal Meetings and Events to Engage Employees. In a world characterized by_**
increasingly distributed workforces, organizations are likely to rely more than ever on events, whether in-person,
virtual or hybrid, to engage and retain employees who now often have fewer daily in-person interactions.

**_Fundamental Shift in Event Environments. Prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the meetings and_**
events industry was principally dominated by in-person events. Following the success of the virtual events held
throughout the pandemic, we believe many in-person events will over time become hybrid events that prominently
feature virtual components to enable event organizers to maximize audience reach and engagement. We also believe
that the increased value proposition and reach of a larger Total Event Program will drive event organizers to host more
events, attracting more attendees, and thus increasing their total event technology spend.

**_Accelerated Adoption of Event Technology to Automate Highly Complex Planning Process. Organizing_**
and executing a meeting, event, or conference is a highly complex process. While many organizations have embraced
digital transformation across functional areas by investing in software to automate workflows, streamline business
processes and enable data collection and analysis, they have less frequently prioritized making similar investments to


-----

modernize their event management processes. In the new event environment, the need to effectively manage a
combination of in-person, virtual and hybrid events has driven greater complexity across an organization’s Total Event
Program. While hybrid events offer significant flexibility to attendees, they add complexity to the organizer, as they
require that the organizers deliver two different, but still consistent, experiences for a single event for all segments of
that event. We believe that this increased complexity and the increased importance of meetings and events have
resulted in an inflection point, and the digital transformation of the event management space has accelerated.

**_Growing Challenge of Managing Events Data to Unlock Actionable Insights Across a Total Event_**
**_Program._** With the emergence of, and continued demand for, virtual and hybrid events, event organizers must now
manage a Total Event Program consisting of multiple events across all event formats. When combined across all the
events in a Total Event Program, engagement data can deliver actionable insights into the optimal action in that
customer’s journey, helping organizations identify leads and advance sales opportunities. We believe the inability to
put together a full and clear picture of interest will lead organizations to use one event technology platform that can
show prospect and customer intent across the Total Event Program.

**_Greater Range of Channels to Engage with Attendees Throughout the Event Lifecycle. Communication_**
with attendees throughout the event lifecycle is critical and event organizers utilize a wide variety of mediums to reach
their intended audience. Marketers and planners require a comprehensive cross-channel platform to help them interact
with attendees throughout the event lifecycle across the customer’s entire journey in one consistent voice.

**_Need for Greater Visibility into Meeting and Event Spend and Return on Investment. Organizations have_**
increasingly adopted software platforms to provide visibility into spend in various functional areas. However, they
have historically lacked a solution to centrally monitor and manage their meetings and events spend. As meetings and
events budgets have grown, organizations are adopting software to help them assess their aggregate spend, make the
event process more efficient and leverage spend data in vendor negotiations. With an accurate picture of spend,
organizations are able to more accurately calculate return on their meetings and events investments. Event spend
management can also ensure that events are designed, organized and managed to meet targeted objectives. For
example, certain event organizers in more regulated environments, such as pharmaceutical sales, face comprehensive
regulatory requirements, like reporting on spend per health care professional, which are not easily manageable with
manual processes.

**_Increased Need for Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations. The changing regulatory environment_**
related to personal data protection is complex. Globally, numerous jurisdictions have passed or are actively
considering passing new or amended privacy laws. As a result, privacy laws are increasing in number, driving more
complexity in managing event attendee personal data. With increased enforcement of these new laws, the number of
fines and other penalties has also increased. The heightened scrutiny of the regulatory environment is driving even
greater focus on compliance needs and data privacy requirements. As customers seek ways to manage compliance and
data privacy, they are searching for a unified technology solution that can efficiently track and monitor their
requirements.

**_Hospitality Cloud_**

**_Increased Hospitality Demand from Group Business. In addition to generating revenue for hotels from_**
accommodations, events have a high attach rate of ancillary hotel services such as, food and beverage, equipment
rental and transportation, which typically generate substantial incremental revenue and profit. Given the highly
profitable nature of events and group meetings, as well as the revenue certainty and predictability they provide to
hotels, competition to attract and win this business is increasingly fierce among hotels and venues. With in-person
events returning as the pandemic recedes, hotels are looking to capitalize on this increase in demand by attracting
event organizers to their properties. As a result, we expect hotel operators to increase spend on efficiently driving
group business.

**_Underinvestment in Group Meetings Business. Event organizers can be found across a broad range of_**
departments, including marketing, sales, travel, human resources, training and development and operations, and have
a wide variety of titles. Due to the decentralized and periodic nature of event planning within organizations, hotel
operators often find it challenging to qualify high-value leads and effectively market to the professionals responsible
for planning meetings and events. As a result of this challenge and the high levels of associated manual effort, hotels


-----

generally underinvest in selling and marketing group meetings. We believe that hotels and venues that leverage
purpose-built, scalable technology solutions, such as ours, are better positioned to generate more revenue and increase
their return on marketing spend.

**_Industry-wide Hotel Staffing Shortages. Hotel operators have experienced persistent staffing challenges_**
since the COVID-19 pandemic began. According to a January 2023 American Hotel & Lodging Association report,
79% of U.S. hotels are experiencing staffing shortages, with 22% severely under-staffed in a way that was affecting
operations. These staffing shortages result in increased demands on staff and reduced satisfaction levels for customers.
Software productivity solutions that allow hotel employees to automate manual workflows and centrally manage
customer demands are increasingly important for hotel operators.

**_Growing Need to Digitize and Automate Highly Manual RFP and Group Business Processes. In searching_**
for a venue, event organizers often submit inquiries and bids to hotels in a variety of formats, including email, phone
call and PDF, Word or Excel files. In responding to these requests, many hoteliers and venue operators often rely on
generic business tools, such as word processing applications and spreadsheets, to respond to these requests. The nonstandard process of both submitting requests and responding to requests results in increased time and cost associated
with an RFP for both parties and often increases the chance of data entry error, heightening the risk of data privacy
issues. As hotels look to streamline efforts and ensure compliance, additional technology solutions will be required.

**_Need to Showcase Meeting and Event Space Virtually. Traditionally, hoteliers and venue operators have_**
showcased their properties to event organizers with in-person site visits. However, even before the pandemic, hoteliers
had begun to utilize virtual tools to showcase their properties in order to reduce spend and streamline the event
planning process. Macroeconomic pressures, sustainability efforts, and an increasingly digitally native planner base
have further accelerated the trend of online and virtual sourcing, to the extent that many event organizers now expect
online site tours, interactive floorplans and event diagrams to be standard offerings.

**_Increasing Need for Group Meetings Business Intelligence to Compete More Effectively. In order to_**
uncover new areas of opportunity and generate leads, hotels and venue operators need to leverage data to evaluate
their performance in this segment. Business intelligence can provide insights into RFP trends, response activities, win
ratios, pace against expected demand, and other key performance metrics. Business intelligence also enables hotels
and venue operators to evaluate their group performance relative to their competition and to identify opportunities for
improvement.

**Industry Opportunity**

According to a 2021 Frost & Sullivan study we commissioned, the TAM for our platform is $29.7 billion,
across our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions.

**_Cvent Event Cloud. According to a 2021 Frost & Sullivan study we commissioned, the annual TAM for the_**
Event Cloud is $25.6 billion worldwide. The TAM for Event Cloud was calculated by first estimating the total number
of organizations that our platform and products address, segmented by size of employee base and organization type,
including corporate and non-corporate, based on the 2017 Statistics of U.S. Businesses and 2020 U.S. Census Data.
Addressability assumptions were then applied by segment and band based on our experience in the industry. An
estimated annual value was then applied to each band of organizations based on survey responses related to spend on
event technology. The total number of organizations within each band was then multiplied by the calculated annual
value for that band. The aggregate calculated value represents the current annual estimated market opportunity of
$14.1 billion and $11.5 billion in the United States and Rest of World, respectively. We believe a significant portion
of our TAM for Event Cloud is underpenetrated, including organizations which use traditional, manual processes or
point solutions to manage events, many of which we believe will adopt event management software solutions going
forward.

**_Cvent Hospitality Cloud. According to a 2021 Frost & Sullivan study we commissioned, the annual TAM_**
for the Hospitality Cloud is $4.1 billion. The TAM for Hospitality Cloud was calculated by first estimating the total
number of hotels with meeting space, segmented by geography, tier, and banded by total square footage of meeting
space. Addressability assumptions were then applied by segment and product based on our experience in the industry.
An estimated annual spend was then applied to each band of hotels and venues based on survey responses related to


-----

spend on group marketing in digital channels. The total number of hotels and venues within each band was then
multiplied by the calculated annual value for that band. The aggregate calculated value represents the current global
annual estimated market opportunity of $4.1 billion.

**Key Credit Strengths**

**_Addressing a Large and Growing, Yet Underpenetrated Opportunity Experiencing Rapid Digitalization._**
Meetings and events represent one of the most effective ways for organizations to engage, educate and motivate their
target audiences. This value proposition is why meetings and events are often regarded as some of the most effective
and best funded marketing strategies. According to the Events Industry Council, in aggregate organizations spent
approximately $1 trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018. According to a 2021 Forrester study we
commissioned, 74% of respondents considered events to be their most important demand generation tactic. Forrester
also estimates that events in total comprise approximately 24% of the average organization’s business-to-business
marketing program budget.

The rapid evolution of the event environment, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly
expanded our market opportunity and accelerated the digital transformation of the underpenetrated event management
software industry. In this new landscape, organizations can reach larger audiences through multiple event formats,
engage with greater frequency given reduced hosting costs associated with virtual events and deliver differentiated
experiences with enhanced technology offerings that manage the full lifecycle of events across the Total Event
Program. As a result, we believe organizations will host more events with more registrants and will also expand their
event technology spend per event. In order to navigate the increased scale and complexity of the new event
environment, we believe organizations relying on point solutions or internally developed tools will invest in purposebuilt system of record platforms to automate workflows, enable data collection and facilitate the hosting of events
across multiple environments. Also, the global shift to a more distributed workforce is causing organizations to gather
in large groups more regularly, further increasing demand for events. As the market leader, Cvent is well-positioned
to benefit from these trends to capture share and further penetrate its $29.7 billion TAM.

We believe the meetings and events industry is presently benefiting from multiple tailwinds that could
facilitate its continued robust recovery from the pandemic. Third-party reports, from the Knowland Group and a major
industry consultant, respectively, show that the global volume of event attendees during 2022 was 1.5 billion,
approximately 12% below the 2019 level of 1.7 billion prior to the pandemic. In the near-term, we expect event
attendance volumes to continue to recover to pre-pandemic levels, driven by the growth of in-person events. A
Northstar survey we commissioned found that 67% of event planners expect more events in 2023 compared to 2022
and 70% of event planners expect increases in event budgets in 2023 compared to 2022. Longer term, we believe that
event attendee volumes will exceed pre-pandemic levels, due to the increased importance of meetings and events to
both marketing and internal use cases as well as the ability to host across multiple formats.

**_Industry Leader with Comprehensive, Differentiated Solutions with Network Effects. Our strong position_**
and the positioning of our platform are defensible. We offer a comprehensive cloud-based platform of mission-critical
event marketing and management solutions for event planners and marketers and hospitality marketing and software
solutions for hoteliers. In connecting both sides of the event landscape, we generate network effects, whereby the
value derived by each side is strengthened by its integration with the other side, all facilitated by our platform.


-----

In the new event landscape, we expect organizations will require a single platform capable of both driving
engagement and managing all of their events. As organizations’ Total Event Programs have rapidly shifted to events
across multiple event formats, point solutions are unable to meet the needs of customers. Our Event Cloud offers event
planners a platform to manage every type of event and all event formats: in-person, virtual and hybrid. As many
incumbent vendors, including Cvent, did not have capabilities for virtual events at the onset of the pandemic,
customers were forced to purchase from point solution vendors when rapidly pivoting to virtual events. We believe
that in order to manage Total Event Programs across in-person, virtual and hybrid events, many of these organizations
will migrate to end-to-end platforms. According to a major industry consultant survey commissioned by the Sponsor,
of the 46% of organizations using different event management solutions for in-person and virtual events,
approximately 35% are likely to consolidate spend onto a single, end-to-end platform in the near-term. As the industry
leader offering a comprehensive platform, we believe Cvent is well-positioned to benefit from this shift.

As organizations’ Total Event Programs deliver multiple high-impact touchpoints across the customer
journey, marketers require a solution to capture and analyze attendee registration and engagement data across multiple
events and all event formats. Our Event Cloud enables event organizers to collect and aggregate a significant amount
of data from before, during and after events, creating a single system of record for all event data. Our platform enables
organizations to combine and analyze event data with data from their CRM and marketing automation systems to
deliver actionable intelligence on customer purchasing intent and next-best actions. The ability to provide value-added
insights into the customer journey has made Event Cloud a mission-critical component of an organization’s marketing
technology stack, increasing the adoption and retention of our platform.

With the rapid return of in-person events amidst industry-wide labor shortages, hotels are increasingly
focused on leveraging technology to efficiently expand their group business volumes. Our Hospitality Cloud enables
hotels to virtually showcase and market their event space to event planners, source and respond to RFPs and automate
the workflows associated with managing group business. The ability to streamline the process for sourcing, winning
and managing business for this highly strategic revenue stream makes our platform integral to the operations of
hospitality providers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, planners sourced approximately $14.0 billion in RFP
value via our platform, illustrating the extent to which Cvent is embedded in the hospitality industry.

Cvent brings together both sides of the event ecosystem via CSN, which connects approximately 109,000
meeting and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our extensive proprietary global
database as of December 31, 2022. As a result of its breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and
extensiveness of its proprietary database, we believe CSN is highly differentiated. We also believe that these factors
enable our marketplace to generate network effects that continually attract event planners and hospitality providers to
our platform.


-----

**_Recession-Resilient and Steady Revenue Model Underpinned by Sum-Certain Contracts. Cvent operates_**
a resilient business model, generating revenue from Event Cloud subscription-based solutions and Hospitality Cloud
marketing-based and subscription-based solutions. The Company’s subscription-based revenue model and strong
emphasis on selling multi-year contracts results in visible, predictable and durable revenue. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, recurring revenue represented 93% of total revenue and approximately 50% of the annual
contractual dollar value of bookings was associated with multi-year subscription contracts.

Central to this resilient business model is the Company’s contracting and pricing structure. Event Cloud
contract amounts are sum-certain based on the committed annual minimum number of registrants and events, rather
than on a purely per-event or per-registrant basis. Generally, if a customer exceeds the number of purchased
registrations, the customer will incur an overage fee for registrations that exceeded the number of registrations
purchased. Hospitality Cloud marketing revenue is generated based on the number of marketing solutions purchased,
rather than on a pay-per-click or impression basis, and software solutions are priced primarily on the number of
licenses purchased. We believe that CSN is a differentiated solution that plays an important role in the sales and
marketing strategy of hospitality providers by enabling them to cost-effectively generate leads, win group business
and drive revenue growth. The terms of our subscription and marketing contracts for both Event Cloud and Hospitality
Cloud are typically non-cancellable, are for annual or multi-year terms and are billed in advance on an annual or
quarterly basis.

Cvent’s recession-resilient model, combined with its experienced, long-tenured management team and strong
culture of innovation, has enabled the Company to deliver strong financial performance through multiple market
cycles, including the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company
demonstrated the strength of its business model during the pandemic when, despite a near-total pause on in-person
events, revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 declined only 12%, and the Company subsequently returned
to revenue growth of 4% and 22% in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. For the quarter ended
March 31, 2023, we experienced revenue growth of 21% compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by organizations
continuing to invest in meetings and events technology today.

**_Strong, Diversified, Blue-chip Customer Base with Robust Customer Unit Economics. We have a large,_**
diversified customer base with approximately 11,000 customers using Event Cloud and approximately 11,000
customers using Hospitality Cloud. Cvent’s customers include large, multinational blue-chip enterprises such as CocaCola, Mastercard, Zoom and many of the world’s largest hospitality providers, including MGM Resorts and Marriott.
Our customers are spread across diverse industries and sectors including companies from hospitality, healthcare,
financial services, technology, education, and industrials, among others, as well as trade associations and non-profits.
As it relates to hotels, the vast majority of purchasing occurs at the property level, rather than at the corporate brand
level. As a result, the Company has limited revenue concentration, with the largest customer accounting for less than
1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Cvent’s customer base exhibits attractive unit economics, with high levels of retention and expansion across
the platform. Cvent maintains a loyal customer base, having cultivated many of its customer relationships for over a
decade through a strong emphasis on customer success. We have a strong track record of facilitating upsell and crosssell within our customers. As of March 31, 2023, our net dollar retention rate was 115.1%. The expansion of our
existing customer base provides exceptional top-line visibility and results in greater profitability given the less costly
nature of selling into existing clients versus new ones.

Our ability to increase customers’ usage of the platform over time results in higher value customer
relationships and represents a significant opportunity to drive sustainable revenue growth. As of December 31, 2022,
55.8% of our Event Cloud customers have subscriptions to more than one of our solutions, representing an increase
from 41.4% as of December 31, 2019. We believe there is a significant opportunity to cross-sell additional solutions
within our existing customer base of approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers as of December 31, 2022.


-----

The significant value of our platform and our continued expansion within existing customers results in large
scale, high-retention customer contracts, as evidenced by the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000
of annual recurring revenue (“ARR”). Revenue from these customers represented 43.7% for the year ended December
31, 2022, an increase from 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We had 935 of such customers as of
December 31, 2022, an increase from 722 of such customers on December 31, 2019, demonstrating our ability to
attract and meet the needs of large organizations. Historically, we have retained our customers with higher average
contract values at a rate higher than our average rate, as evidenced by a net dollar retention rate of 124.4% and a lostonly churn rate below 1% as of March 31, 2023 for customers that contribute more than $100,000 of ARR. Our long
customer tenure, consistent customer expansion and strong customer base, including large enterprise customers, helps
drive predictable and durable revenue.

**_Attractive Financial Profile Complemented by Clear Path for Margin Expansion via Identified Cost_**
**_Savings and Operating Leverage. Cvent maintains an attractive financial profile, characterized by a combination of_**
long-term growth, strong profitability and consistent free cash flow generation. Cvent demonstrated strong resiliency
through the unprecedented disruption to the event ecosystem resulting from the pandemic, realizing a compound
annual revenue growth rate of 3.6% for the three-year period from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2022 when
the underlying events market declined significantly. The Company has accelerated growth following the pandemic,
generating $659.4 million in revenue for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023, representing 22.4% over
the prior year period.

In addition to its durable growth, Cvent maintains attractive unit economics, characterized by 73.3% NonGAAP Gross Margin for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, high levels of customer retention and an integrated
technology stack that enables cost-effective cross-sell and upsell. As a result, the Company has the ability to operate
at high margins: for example, in 2017, the Company generated 32.7% Adjusted Cash EBITDA margins. From 2017
to 2022, we experienced a decline in margins due to intentional investments to support long-term growth. We
consolidated ten products into four, including the migration of the Lanyon customer base, re-built our core event
management platform and quickly built and deployed a virtual solution at scale during COVID-19 to meet the rapidly
evolving needs of customers resulting from the disruption to in-person events. The increased level of investment
during this period was primarily focused on research and development but also temporarily constrained the efficiency
with which we were able to sell, serve and support our customers. As a result, for the twelve-month period ended
March 31, 2023, the Company generated $147.0 million of Adjusted Cash EBITDA, representing a 22.3% margin and
$87.3 million of Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, representing 59.3% Adjusted Cash EBITDA less
Capital Expenditures Conversion. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Financial Information— Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.”

We believe that the Company’s competitive position is stronger than ever and that we are now wellpositioned to benefit from these investments. In 2022, Cvent reached an inflection point as the events end market
stabilized which, coupled with its recent platform and product enhancements, enabled the Company to prioritize
operational improvements to better manage its cost structure, drive margin expansion and boost profitability going
forward. In particular, the Company began to right-size its level of investment in certain areas through headcount
optimization and vendor rationalization. Notably, headcount decreased 2.1% between November 30, 2022 and March
31, 2023 while revenue growth has continued to accelerate, as demonstrated by the 21% revenue growth for the quarter
ended March 31, 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022.

As a result of the Sponsor’s diligence, several areas of opportunities for additional efficiency have been
identified that could accelerate realization of cost savings. According to a report from a third-party consultant


-----

commissioned by the Sponsor, the aggregate cost savings opportunity is up to approximately $74 million, with
potential upside. We believe that these savings, which are split between labor (approximately $58 million) and
procurement (approximately $16 million), are readily actionable and achievable. Labor initiatives include the
continued automation of manual processes as well as further offshoring of research and development personnel to our
India office. Additionally, we plan to right-size and simplify the organization, and selectively outsource non-core
functions, especially within services, customer support, and corporate IT. On the procurement side, cost savings will
be largely driven by vendor rationalization, top vendor negotiation, and office footprint consolidation. We expect a
majority of savings will be realized within 12 months of the closing of the Transactions and the full-run rate savings
will be realized in 18 months following closing of the Transactions. Fully implemented, these cost saving measures
could result in improved Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA Margins of approximately 34%, which are in line with
our margin profile for fiscal year 2017 on a revenue base that is approximately 63% larger as of the twelve-month
period ended March 31, 2023 compared to fiscal year 2017. Note that these assumptions and estimates are inherently
uncertain and subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Transactions—We may not realize the anticipated cost savings from the
Transactions.”

**_Highly Experienced, Founder-led Management Team with Demonstrated Track Record of Execution._**
Cvent is led by a long-tenured management team with extensive expertise in the meetings and events space. Our
executive team is led by founder and CEO Reggie Aggarwal, who founded Cvent in 1999 and has held this role ever
since. Cvent’s current management team includes seven of the 11 members of the original leadership, who have led
the company through private equity ownership and two separate periods as a public company and have an average
tenure of approximately 12 years at Cvent. We believe our management team has the vision and expertise, as well as
the experience of navigating through multiple market cycles, to successfully execute on our strategy over the long
term.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the following strengths provide us with competitive differentiation relative to our
competitors:

**_One Platform to Manage Events and Drive Engagement Across the Total Event Program. Our platform_**
enables organizations to manage and execute internal and external events of all sizes, complexities and delivery
models. Our platform serves as a single system of record for the Total Event Program, enabling event organizers to
maximize, collect and take action on attendee registration and engagement data before, during and after events. This
centralized repository of data collected from attendee interactions across multiple events throughout the customer
journey delivers actionable intelligence on the interests and preferences of an organization’s customers and prospects.
We believe that our ability to offer an integrated platform that maximizes engagement across a full suite of event
marketing and management solutions for in-person, virtual and hybrid events is a competitive differentiator when
compared to competitors offering point solutions for specific processes or event delivery models.

**_Management of the Entire Event Lifecycle. We offer an integrated, end-to-end, cloud-based platform that_**
addresses the entire lifecycle of meetings and events of every type and format. Organizations using point solutions are
required to cobble together disparate products and data silos from across the event lifecycle to manage a single event.
Importing and exporting data into and out of multiple systems creates data integrity concerns, increases potential risk
as it relates to privacy laws and increases cost as it is highly labor-intensive. Our platform approach enables
organizations to streamline the workflow for managing all elements of an event, and results in a more fluid, branded,
secure and engaging experience for attendees.

**_Integrations with Other Critical Enterprise Systems. Our solution includes native integrations with leading_**
CRM and marketing automation platforms such as Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle Eloqua, HubSpot and Microsoft
Dynamics, and is also capable of connecting to any web-based program through APIs and webhooks. Our end-to-end
platform scores, consolidates and shares attendee engagement data through integrations with CRM and marketing
automation tools to help marketers enhance buyer profiles, obtain a clearer picture of attendee interest, and follow up
more quickly and accurately with attendees, bolstering sales pipelines and aiding in client retention. Our Salesforce
integration is differentiated from our competitors’ offerings in that it empowers sales teams to drive event attendance


-----

by inviting or registering their customers and prospects directly from within Salesforce, mitigating the need for
marketing teams to interface with sales to coordinate invite lists, promotions, and discounts with sales teams.

Our solution also integrates with Concur, Amex, and global distributions systems (GDS) like Sabre and
Amadeus, to provide visibility into expenses and streamline the approval process. Specifically, our Concur integration
provides visibility into typical meeting expenditures and provides insights regarding individual traveler costs.
Collectively, this helps automate the back-end reconciliation process for meetings, travel and expense data.
Additionally, Cvent integrates with web communication systems such as Zoom, Teams and Webex, to help customers
manage attendee registration and capture participation details. These technologies can also be combined with Cvent
solutions to deliver engaging and impactful hybrid events, such as Zoomtopia, which was powered by both Cvent
technologies and Zoom Events.

**_Relationships with Meeting and Event Planners. Unlike personnel in traditional, clearly defined_**
departments, planners can often be based within a wide range of corporate departments. Given the periodic nature of
events, in many cases event planning falls outside of the scope of their day-to-day responsibilities and these
professionals dedicate only a portion of their time to event planning. Through our more than two decades supporting
the events industry, we have developed a substantial proprietary database of professionals who we believe are involved
in meeting and event planning activities within their organizations. Given our industry prominence and the millions
of events we have powered throughout our history, we have developed expertise on how to maximize event success,
and we create thought leadership content that we promote to our database of professionals and through digital
marketing.

**_Large Seamless Online Venue Marketplace. We believe that CSN is a valuable, proprietary resource for_**
both components of the meetings and events ecosystem—marketers and event planners as well as hoteliers and venue
operators—due to its:

    - _Depth and Breadth of Venue Profiles. Our proprietary network includes detailed event space profile_
information on over 302,000 hotels and other venues as of December 31, 2022. CSN enables planners
to conduct searches and filter results based on over 200 characteristics and criteria per hotel profile. The
size and accuracy of our database is of critical importance to planners and sets CSN apart.

    - _Billions in RFP Value. During 2022, planners sourced approximately $14.0 billion in RFP value through_
our sourcing tools, including CSN. In interviews conducted by a third-party consultant on behalf of the
Sponsor, several Hospitality Cloud customers indicated that CSN is the largest source of RFP volume
for their group business. We believe that by offering a global marketplace to connect both sides of the
events ecosystem, CSN is a critical external lead generation channel for event and group meetings
business.

    - _Integration with Hotels. As of December 31, 2022, we are directly integrated with the back-end sales,_
catering and IT systems of more than 41,000 hotels, reducing manual data entry for hotel staff and
enabling a more efficient RFP response process. We believe this level of adoption and back-end IT
system integration from our hotel partners is further evidence of the value hoteliers and venues derive
from CSN.

    - _Network Effects Across the Events Ecosystem. By connecting both sides of the meetings and events_
ecosystem, CSN generates network effects. As more hoteliers and venue operators list and market their
properties on CSN, it becomes more valuable to the more than 109,000 event planners and marketers
sourcing venues for their events. Increased usage by event planners increases the volume of RFPs
delivered to hotels and venues, thereby increasing the value we deliver to hoteliers and venue operators
and causing more hotels and venues to list their properties on the network.

    - _Efficiency for Planners. The vertical nature of CSN makes it a highly relevant and effective tool for_
planners in identifying an appropriate venue. CSN also provides substantial time savings benefits, as
planners can quickly evaluate, generally at no cost, an extensive network of potential hotels and venues
and receive rapid responses from a selected shortlist.


-----

    - _Lead Sourcing for Hoteliers and Venue Operators._ Our ability to connect hoteliers and venue operators
with high quality leads makes us an essential resource for hoteliers and venue operators and has resulted
in a significant volume of RFPs processed. In part due to the extensive scope of our marketplace, many
hotels have integrated CSN into their core back-end IT systems.

**_Recurring Revenue Model with Sum-Certain Contracts._** Our business model is highly recurring and
predictable with annual or multi-year subscriptions under sum-certain contracts. Our multi-year contracts deliver
strong revenue visibility and resilience, as evidenced by our performance through the COVID-19 pandemic. Contracts
for our Event Cloud solution range from one to five years in length. These contracts generally include subscription
fees for licensed modules, which are based on volume commitments aligned with the registrations and events
anticipated across the customer’s Total Event Program. Our Event Cloud contracts typically include overage fees for
usage beyond the specified registrant and event amounts. We also sell our Hospitality Cloud solutions to hoteliers and
venue operators through annual or multi-year contracts, which typically range from one to three years. These contracts
typically include subscription fees for our marketing placements and licensed software modules.

**_Investment in Product Innovation. We believe that we have an industry leading pace of innovation, deep_**
dedication to security, commitment to compliance and data privacy and greater investment in next-gen technology
that will further strengthen our solutions. We have continuously invested in our business and technology, with
cumulative spend of approximately $846 million on research and development since 2017. With this investment, we
built an entirely new comprehensive platform in the cloud built for flexibility and scalability which enable cost
optimization. The strength and breadth of experience of our over 1,000 employee research and development team
enabled us to respond rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing our virtual event solution in September 2020,
which we continued to improve and optimize through 2021 and 2022. As the in-person event format began rebounding
in the wake of the pandemic, we were, and remain, uniquely positioned to meet customer demand for all event types
including internal and external; formats including in-person, virtual, and hybrid; and sizes ranging from large to small.

**_Commitment to Compliance and Privacy Requirements. A compliance mindset underpins our technology_**
foundation. Our platform includes features and options designed to support compliance across governing bodies and
provides options and features to enable customers to make privacy and compliance choices that align with customer
needs and relevant legal requirements. Additionally, our platform has built-in solutions to facilitate compliance with
data subject requests. These solutions allow our customers to obtain and maintain required certifications.

**Our Strategy**

Key elements of our strategy include:

**_Expand Our Customer Base by Adding New Marketers, Planners, Hotels and Venues. We believe that_**
with the accelerated digital transformation of the events industry, organizations will host more events, with more
attendees, and will have a greater need for event technology. We expect organizations will require a single platform
capable of both driving engagement and managing all of their events, which will further increase the demand for our
solutions. We believe a significant portion of organizations that embraced virtual events during the pandemic have
seen the promise of event digitalization and will no longer rely on homegrown tools and manual processes to manage
events.

We also believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our penetration of the hotel and venue market.
With the return in-person events, group meetings business again represents a significant component of hotel revenue.
We believe that hoteliers seeking to grow their group meetings revenue will increasingly seek out technology solutions
to market their venues and generate incremental business. With hoteliers and venue operators operating with reduced
workforces and managing through a tight and competitive labor market, our solution enables them to automate
marketing and sales processes to drive efficiency with fewer resources.

**_Facilitate Upsell and Cross-Sell Activity Within Our Customers. Our Event Cloud consists of multiple_**
solutions for marketing and managing meetings and events. As of December 31, 2022, 56% of our Event Cloud
customers have subscriptions to more than one of our solutions. We believe there is a significant opportunity to cross

-----

sell additional solutions and add-on modules within our existing base of approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers
as of December 31, 2022.

Our Hospitality Cloud solution not only connects hotels and venues with tens of thousands of planners, but
also provides a suite of products to market their venues and manage sales and operations of their group business. We
continue to expand our inventory of marketing placements and add specialized tiers for hotels and venues to purchase
and develop software solutions to help manage group business. As we add these new capabilities, we believe that
hoteliers and venue operators will leverage our marketplace offerings to reach buyers at scale and expand the use of
our platform to manage the marketing, sales and operations of their group meetings business more efficiently and
profitably. In addition, our Hospitality Cloud software products have traction with our customers with headroom for
further growth. As of December 31, 2022, 26% of Hospitality Cloud customers have subscriptions to one or more
software products and one or more marketing products. We believe there is a significant opportunity to cross-sell
additional software and marketing solutions within our existing base of approximately 11,000 Hospitality Cloud
customers as of December 31, 2022.

**Expand Our International Footprint. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand globally and**
increase our revenue derived from outside of North America, which accounted for 12.0% of total revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2022. In our experience, the adoption rate of event technology outside North America has
typically lagged North American adoption. As global adoption of event technology increases, we expect revenue
derived from outside of North America to increase as a percentage of total revenue. With respect to the Hospitality
Cloud, while our international hotel and venue listings represent approximately 59% of the total venues in CSN as of
December 31, 2022, only a small percentage of our RFPs are sent to these international hotels and venues. If the
volume of international meeting RFPs on CSN increases, we expect our international revenue to expand. We have
sales offices in eight countries across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific (“APAC”) and the Middle East as of
December 31, 2022.

**Extend Our Product Leadership. We have invested in research and development to build and improve our**
platform over time. The strength of our platform and solutions has helped to solidify our position as the leading cloudbased platform for event marketing and management and hospitality solutions. We have added additional products
and features over time and regularly implement updates and improvements to our platform in order to improve our
position relative to competitors, meet the needs of our customers and to improve the event experience for all
stakeholders in the event ecosystem.

**The Transactions**

**_Merger Agreement_**

On March 14, 2023, the Issuer entered into the Merger Agreement with Merger Sub and Cvent. On the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Cvent, with Cvent surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer.

At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), except as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing
prior to the Effective Time by the Issuer and a Cvent stockholder, each share of Cvent common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share (“Cvent Common Stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any shares of Cvent Common Stock held by Cvent as treasury stock or owned by the Issuer, Merger Sub or any
other subsidiaries thereof, or any shares as to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised in accordance with
Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $8.50 in cash, without interest thereon.

Each party’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to various customary closing conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Cvent Common Stock, (ii) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) certain other approvals and clearances by
government authorities, and (iv) other customary conditions for a transaction of this type, such as the absence of any
legal restraint prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and the absence of any Company Material Adverse Effect
(as defined in the Merger Agreement).


-----

The parties to the Merger Agreement have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants
in the Merger Agreement. Among other things, (i) Cvent has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business and preserve intact
in all material respects its assets, properties, material contracts and significant commercial relationships with third
parties, from the date of the Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms, and not to take certain actions prior to the Effective Time without the prior
written consent of the Issuer (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (ii) from the date of the
Merger Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance
with its terms, Cvent has agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to solicit or engage in discussions or negotiations
regarding any alternative business combination transaction.

The Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for the parties thereto, including the
right of each party to terminate the agreement if the Merger has not been consummated by December 14, 2023 (subject
to an extension to March 14, 2024 under certain circumstances for the purpose of obtaining certain regulatory
approvals, in either case, the “Outside Date”).

This offering is not conditioned upon the Closing. If the Merger is not consummated simultaneously with
this offering, the gross proceeds of this offering will be funded into escrow and, upon release of the funds from escrow,
the proceeds from this offering will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions as set forth below or, if applicable,
will be used to fund the Special Mandatory Redemption as described herein. See “— Escrow.”

**_Financing Transactions_**

In connection with the Merger Agreement, we obtained committed financing for a $900 million new senior
secured term loan facility (the “New Term Loan Facility”) and a $115 million new senior secured revolving credit
facility (the “New Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the New Term Loan Facility, the “New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities”). This offering of notes is intended to decrease the size of the New Term Loan Facility on
a dollar-for-dollar basis.

In connection with the consummation of the Merger, the Issuer or the Parent, as the case may be, intend to
enter into the following financing transactions:

    - the borrowing by the Issuer of $400 million under the New Term Loan Facility;

    - the entry by the Issuer into the New Revolving Credit Facility;

    - the issuance by the Issuer of $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes offered hereby;

    - the issuance by Capstone TopCo, Inc. (“Topco”) of $1,250 million initial liquidation preference of nonconvertible preferred equity (the “Preferred Equity”) to certain affiliates of Vista Equity Partners,
Cvent’s current majority shareholder (“Vista”), who have agreed to invest a portion of the proceeds from
the merger consideration received by Vista to acquire such Preferred Equity (the “Preferred Financing”);
and

    - the contribution of $2,600 million of common equity by the Sponsors (“Equity Financing”).

The proceeds from these financing transactions will be used to (i) finance the consummation of the Merger
and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including amounts payable thereunder, (ii) repay in
full all outstanding indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility, (iii) provide cash on hand to the Issuer and (iv)
pay related fees, costs, premiums and expenses in connection with the Transactions.

See “Use of Proceeds” and “Description of Other Financing Arrangements” for more information.


-----

**Escrow**

If the Merger is not consummated simultaneously with this offering, concurrently with the closing of this
offering, the Issuer will enter into an escrow agreement relating to the notes (the “Escrow Agreement”) with
Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee for the notes and as escrow agent (in such capacity, the “Escrow
Agent”), pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of
the notes offered hereby into a segregated escrow account for the notes until the conditions to release of the property
in the escrow account (the “Escrow Release Conditions”) are satisfied. The property in the escrow account will be
pledged as security for the benefit of the holders of the notes. If, among other things, the Merger is not consummated
on or prior to the Outside Date, the Issuer will redeem, on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below)
in accordance with the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, all of the notes at the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”).

**Sources and Uses of Funds**

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions (and
after the gross proceeds from this offering are released from escrow, if applicable), assuming they occurred on March
31, 2023, and based on estimated amounts outstanding on that date. Actual amounts will vary from the estimated
amounts shown below depending on several factors, including, among others, the amount of existing debt to be
refinanced, incremental cash added to the balance sheet, changes made to the sources of the contemplated financings,
the number of shares of capital stock and equity awards outstanding on the closing date of the Merger and differences
in the fees and expenses.

If the Merger is not consummated simultaneously with this offering, the gross proceeds of this offering will
be funded into escrow and, upon release of the funds from escrow, the proceeds from this offering will be used to fund
a portion of the Transactions as set forth below or, if applicable, will be used to fund the Special Mandatory
Redemption as described herein. See “—Summary—The Transactions—Escrow.”

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may be agents and/or lenders under the Existing Credit
Facility and may therefore receive a portion of the net proceeds from the offering used to repay any such indebtedness.
See “Plan of Distribution—Other Relationships.”

Upon the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Parent and each of the Issuer’s
wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (including Cvent) that guarantee our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In the future, each
wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees indebtedness of the Issuer or any guarantor will guarantee the notes,
subject to certain exceptions. As of the issue date of the notes, none of our foreign subsidiaries will guarantee the notes, and no such
subsidiaries (existing or formed in the future) are expected to guarantee the notes in the future. The guarantees are subject to release under
specified circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”
(3) As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, before intercompany

in its reasonable judgment the Merger will not be consummated
on or prior to the Outside Date or that the Merger Agreement
has been terminated, the Issuer will be required to redeem all of
the notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture that will
govern the notes at a redemption price (the “Special Mandatory
Redemption Price”) equal to 100% of the initial issue price of
the of notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding,
the date of such redemption (the “Special Mandatory
Redemption Date”).

See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

If the Merger is not consummated simultaneously with this
offering and the gross proceeds of this offering of the notes are
deposited into a segregated escrow account, one or more funds
or limited partnerships managed or advised by affiliates of the
Sponsors will commit to the accrued and unpaid interest owing
to the holders of the notes plus other amounts needed to


-----

discharge the indenture in the event of a Special Mandatory
Redemption.

**Guarantees ......................................................** Prior to the consummation of the Merger and pending
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, if applicable, the
notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Parent and
Merger Sub. Upon the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the notes will be fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Parent and each of the
Issuer’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that
guarantee our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (including
Cvent).

In the future, each wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiary
of the Issuer that guarantees indebtedness of the Issuer or any
guarantor will guarantee the notes, subject to certain exceptions.
As of the issue date of the notes, none of our foreign subsidiaries
will guarantee the notes, and no such subsidiaries (existing or
formed in the future) are expected to guarantee the notes in the
future. The guarantees are subject to release under specified
circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**Security ............................................................** In the event this offering of notes is consummated prior to the
completion of the Merger then, pending the consummation of
the Merger, the notes will be secured only by a senior-priority
security interest on the escrow account and the funds held in the
escrow account.

Upon the consummation of the Merger, from and after the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, if applicable, the
notes and the related guarantees will be secured on a seniorpriority basis by substantially all assets of the Issuer and the
guarantors which assets will also secure the Issuer’s and each
guarantors’ obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities on an equal priority basis, subject to certain limitations
and exceptions and permitted liens. See “Description of Notes—
Security for the Notes.”

**Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement ......** In connection with the issuance of the notes and upon
consummation of the Merger, we will enter into an intercreditor
agreement (the “Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement”) with
the Notes Collateral Agent (as defined herein) and the collateral
agent under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the
“Bank Collateral Agent”). The Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement will set forth the relative rights of, and relationship
among, the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders of the notes, the
Bank Collateral Agent and the lenders under the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the applicable representative of the
holders under any other future equal priority debt in respect of
the exercise of rights and remedies against the Issuer and the
guarantors. See “Description of Secured Notes—Security for
the Secured Notes—Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.”

**Ranking ...........................................................** Upon the consummation of the Merger, from and after the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, if applicable, the


-----

notes will be the Issuer’s and the related guarantees will be the
guarantors’ senior secured obligations and will:

                        - rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s
and each guarantor’s existing and future senior
indebtedness, including the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities;

                        - rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and
each guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness and
other obligations that expressly provide for their
subordination to the notes and the related guarantees;

                        - be effectively senior to all of the Issuer’s and each
guarantors’ existing and future unsecured indebtedness
to the extent of the value of the Collateral securing the
notes;

                        - rank equally in priority as to the Collateral with respect
to borrowings and guarantees under our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and any other equal priority
indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral;

                        - be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the
guarantors’ indebtedness that is secured by assets that
do not constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of
such assets securing such indebtedness; and

                        - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness, claims of holders of preferred stock and
other liabilities of any subsidiary of the Issuer that is
not a guarantor of the notes.

As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to the Transactions, the Issuer and the guarantors would have
had $900 million in total indebtedness outstanding, none of
which would have been subordinated and all of which would
have been senior secured indebtedness, consisting of $400
million of borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and $500 million of the notes. In addition, as of March
31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, we would have had $115 million of availability to
incur additional secured indebtedness under the New Revolving
Credit Facility.

As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, before
intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
represented approximately 26.8% of our revenues, 26.4% of our
total assets and 8.9% of our total liabilities.

**Optional Redemption .....................................** Prior to     , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, at any time
and from time to time, redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the


-----

notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but excluding, the redemption date plus the applicable
“make-whole premium” described under “Description of
Notes—Optional Redemption.”

From and after     , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, at any
time and from time to time, redeem the notes, in whole or in
part, at the applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

In addition, prior to     , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option,
at any time and from time to time, redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes with an amount not to
exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a
redemption price of      % of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

In addition, at any time on or after    , 2024 and prior to
, 2026, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the
notes with an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from
any Qualified IPO (as defined herein) at a redemption price of
% of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date.

See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Change of Control Offer ................................** Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of changes of control, if
we do not redeem the notes, you will have the right, as holders
of the notes, to require the Issuer to purchase some or all of your
notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the purchase date. See
“Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Change of Control.”

**Certain Covenants ..........................................** The notes will be issued under an indenture that will contain
covenants that will, upon the consummation of the Merger, from
and after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, if
applicable, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuer and
the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to:

                        - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue
disqualified stock or certain preferred stock;

                        - pay dividends and make other distributions or

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL**
**INFORMATION**

The following table sets forth summary historical and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information of the Company for the periods and dates indicated.

The summary historical consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and consolidated statements of cash flows data for the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 have been derived from the Company’s historical audited
consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. The summary
historical unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2023 and the unaudited condensed
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows data for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023 have been derived from the
Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum. The summary unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive
loss data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 have been derived by taking the audited consolidated statement
of operations and comprehensive loss data for the year ended December 31, 2022, adding the unaudited condensed
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss data for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and
subtracting the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss data for the three
months ended March 31, 2022.

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the
audited consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of Cvent management, include all adjustments, consisting
of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of the results for those periods. Results for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or
any future reporting period. Our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited historical condensed
consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum do not reflect the impact of
the Transactions.

The historical consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in conformity with GAAP.

The summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of March 31, 2023 gives
effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2023. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss data have been adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions as if they occurred on January 1, 2022. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of operations and comprehensive loss data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 have been derived
by taking the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss data for
the year ended December 31, 2022, adding the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations
and comprehensive loss data for the three months ended March 31, 2023, and subtracting the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive data for the three months ended March 31, 2022.
See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.” The summary unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 have been included in this
offering memorandum in order to provide investors with pro forma information for the latest practicable 12-month
period.

The Transactions will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The pro forma
adjustments reflect adjustments required under GAAP for business combinations and other adjustments, which are
based upon, among other things, preliminary estimates of fair market values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Revisions to the preliminary estimates of fair market value
may have a significant impact on the pro forma amounts of total assets, total liabilities and equity, revenues,
depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense and income tax expense. The actual adjustments related to
the Transactions will be made as of the closing date of the Transactions and may differ from those reflected in the
summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presented below. Such differences may
be material. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information are for informational
purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial position actually would be if


-----

the Transactions had occurred at any date, nor do such data purport to project the results of operations for any future
period or as of any future date.

The following historical and unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information is only a
summary and should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” and our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto incorporated by
reference into this offering memorandum, as well as the information included under the headings “Special Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “—The Transactions,” “Risk Factors,” “Capitalization” and “Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described_
_below and all of the information included or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum before deciding_
_whether to purchase the notes. Any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business, results of_
_operations and financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and_
_uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem_
_immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In_
_such a case, you may lose all or part of your original investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-_
_looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking_
_statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this offering memorandum. In addition, you should_
_consider the risks associated with Cvent’s business that appear in Cvent’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year_
_ended December 31, 2022, which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum._ _See “Incorporation of_
_certain information by reference” for more information about the documents incorporated by reference in this offering_
_memorandum._

**Risks Related to the Transactions**

**_After the Transactions, funds affiliated with the Sponsors will control us and may have conflicts of interest with us_**
**_or you in the future._**

Immediately following consummation of the Transactions, the Sponsors will control the Issuer and,
indirectly, Cvent. As a result, funds affiliated with the Sponsors will have control over our decisions to enter into any
corporate transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of the board of directors
of Cvent or equity holders of us or any of the parent companies, regardless of whether the noteholders believe that
any such transactions are in their own best interest. For example, funds affiliated with the Sponsors could cause us to
make acquisitions that increase the amount of indebtedness that is secured or to sell assets, which may impair our
ability to make payments under the notes.

In addition, funds affiliated with the Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and
may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Funds
affiliated with the Sponsors may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a
result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as funds affiliated with the Sponsors continue
to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our equity interests, even if such amount is less
than 50%, funds affiliated with the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our
decisions.

**_We may not realize the anticipated cost savings from the Transactions._**

The benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the Transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to
realize anticipated cost savings. We believe that we will be able to, among other matters, save on our costs through
labor and procurement initiatives. We have estimated that we will be able to achieve annual “run rate” cost savings of
up to approximately $74 million within 18 months following the closing of Transactions as a result of these and other
initiatives. These cost savings are a permitted addback to the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit
agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and they should not be viewed as a projection
of future performance. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial
Information.” Our success in realizing these cost savings, and the timing of this realization, depends on many factors.
Even if we are able to execute our plans successfully, this may not result in the full realization of the cost savings that
we currently expect, either within the expected time frame, or at all. In addition, we cannot assure you that the costs
to achieve these cost savings will not be higher than we anticipated. Therefore, we cannot assure you that any
anticipated cost savings will be achieved or that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate. Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant costs we expect to incur in order to achieve such cost savings, and
there can be no assurance that such costs will not be materially higher than presently contemplated, as such costs are
difficult to estimate accurately. If our cost savings are less than our estimates or our cost savings initiatives adversely


-----

affect our business or cost more or take longer to implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove to be
inaccurate, our results could be lower than we anticipate.

**_Litigation filed against the Company could prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions._**

The Company and members of our board of directors are, and may become parties, among others, to various
claims and litigation related to the Transactions, including putative stockholder class actions. Among other remedies,
the plaintiffs in such matters may seek, and have sought in the pending litigation described below, to enjoin the
consummation of the Transactions. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay
or prevent the consummation of the Transactions. Moreover, litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could
divert the Company’s or our respective managements’ attention away from their regular business, and, if any lawsuit
is adversely resolved against us, could have a material adverse impact on its or our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

One of the conditions to the consummation of the Transactions is that no law, order or injunction prohibits
the consummation of the Transactions. The Company and members of our board of directors were named as
defendants in a two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York captioned
_O’Dell v. Cvent Holding Corp. et al., Case No. 23-cv-03688 (filed May 2, 2023) and Wang v. Cvent Holding Corp. et_
_al., Case No. 23-cv-03799 (filed May 5, 2023). The Company and members of our board of directors were also named_
as defendants in one lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Westchester captioned
_Herzog v. Aggarwal, Index No. 61007/2023, (filed May 10, 2023). These lawsuits challenges the adequacy of the_
public disclosures related to the merger and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin us from completing
the merger. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in these lawsuits and the plaintiffs in this
litigation or in possible future similar lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation
of the merger, then such an injunction may prevent the merger from being completed, or delay it from being completed
within the expected time frame.

**_The pro forma financial statements included in this offering memorandum are presented for illustrative purposes_**
**_only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations following consummation of_**
**_the Transactions._**

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this offering
memorandum are presented for illustrative purposes only, are based on various adjustments, assumptions and
preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of our actual financial condition or results of operations following
consummation of the Transactions. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially
from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this offering memorandum. Our actual financial condition and results of
operations following consummation of the Transactions may not be consistent with, or evident from, these pro forma
financial statements. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove
to be accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following consummation
of the Transactions. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.”

**Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Notes**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to operate our business,_**
**_react to changes in the economy or our industry, prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes, pay_**
**_our other debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments. In addition, the value of the_**
**_rights of holders of the notes to the Collateral may be reduced by any increase in the indebtedness secured by the_**
**_Collateral._**

We will have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant interest and principal payments. As of
March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuer and the guarantors would have
had $900 million in total indebtedness outstanding, none of which would have been subordinated and all of which
would have been senior secured indebtedness, consisting of $400 million of borrowings under the New Term Loan
Facility, and $500 million of the notes. In addition, as of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to
the Transactions, we would have had $115 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the
New Revolving Credit Facility. Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement that will govern the New Senior


-----

Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby, we may be able to incur
substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or
acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could increase. Specifically,
our high level of debt could have important consequences to the holders of the notes, including the following:

    - it may be difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under our
outstanding debt, including the notes;

    - our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;

    - requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal
and interest on our indebtedness, including the notes, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow
to fund our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other purposes;

    - we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions and our flexibility to
plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry is more limited;

    - our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to
our competitors, may be compromised due to our high level of debt and the restrictive covenants in the
credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and the indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby;

    - our ability to borrow additional funds or to refinance debt may be limited; and

    - it may cause potential or existing customers or vendors to not contract with us due to concerns over our
ability to meet our financial obligations.

If the Issuer or the guarantors incur any additional secured indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes and
related guarantees, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with such holders in any proceeds distributed
in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the Issuer or a
guarantor, subject to any collateral arrangements. See “Description of Other Financing Arrangements” and
“Description of Notes.”

**_Despite our indebtedness levels on the closing date after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we and our_**
**_subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated_**
**_with our substantial leverage._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the
credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern the notes
offered hereby will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a
number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness that may be incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. If we incur additional debt above the levels that will be in effect on the closing date
after giving effect to the Transactions, the risks associated with our leverage, including those described above, would
increase. The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will provide $400 million of borrowings under the New Term
Loan Facility, all of which will be borrowed at closing to finance the Transactions. In addition, as of March 31, 2023,
on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had an additional $115 million of
availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility, which may be drawn
after the closing date. Further, the restrictions in the indenture that will govern the notes and the credit agreement that
will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade
payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined in such debt instruments.


-----

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service_**
**_obligations to increase significantly and could adversely impact our ability to refinance our indebtedness._**

Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
or other variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had $400 million of outstanding debt at variable interest
rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even
though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for
servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. A 0.25% increase in the expected rate of interest under
our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $1 million,
which amount would increase to the extent any borrowings are made on our New Revolving Credit Facility.
Additionally, an unfavorable movement in interest rates, primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”),
could result in higher interest rate expense and cash payments for us. Although we may enter into interest rate swaps,
involving the exchange of floating for fixed-rate interest payments, to reduce interest rate volatility, we cannot provide
assurance that we will enter into such arrangements or that they will successfully mitigate such interest rate volatility.

**_We may be unable to service our indebtedness, including the notes._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends
on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional
economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control, including the
availability of financing in the international banking and capital markets. Lower net revenues generally will reduce
our cash flow. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future
borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes, to
refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to
restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, which could cause us to default on our debt
obligations and impair our liquidity. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of
the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher
interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business
operations.

Moreover, in the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness, including the notes, could elect to declare
all such indebtedness to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The lenders under the
New Revolving Credit Facility could also elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans
and institute foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If
we breach our covenants under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we would be in default thereunder. The
lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_The credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will govern_**
**_the notes offered hereby will each impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Issuer and its_**
**_restricted subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities._**

The credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture that will
govern the notes offered hereby will each impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These
restrictions will limit the Issuer’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;

    - pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;

    - make certain investments;

    - incur certain liens;


-----

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - merge or consolidate;

    - enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other
payments to the Issuer or the guarantors;

    - designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the notes;
and

    - transfer or sell assets.

The Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries will be subject to covenants, representations and warranties in
respect of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, including, in the case of the New Revolving Credit Facility, a
senior lien net leverage ratio financial covenant in the credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities. See “Description of Other Financing Arrangements.”

As a result of these restrictions, we will be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable
to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.
The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be
able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our
indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to
time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these
borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot
refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

**_A decline in our operating results or available cash could cause us to experience difficulties in complying with_**
**_covenants contained in more than one agreement, which could result in our bankruptcy or liquidation._**

If we were to sustain a decline in our operating results or available cash, we could experience difficulties in
complying with the financial covenant contained in the credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities. The failure to comply with such covenant could result in an event of default under the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and by reason of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, other indebtedness may then
become immediately due and payable. In addition, should an event of default occur, the lenders under our New
Revolving Credit Facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making loans and institute
foreclosure proceedings against their collateral, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating
performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would
be in default under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described
above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

**_Repayment of our debt, including required principal and interest payments on the notes, is dependent on cash flow_**
**_generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control._**

Our subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly, repayment
of our indebtedness, including the notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and (if they
are not guarantors of the notes) their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or
otherwise.


-----

Unless they are guarantors of the notes, the Issuer’s subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts
due on the notes or to make funds available to the Issuer or the guarantors for that purpose. Our non-guarantor
subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in
respect of our indebtedness, including the notes. Each non-guarantor subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under
certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our non-guarantor
subsidiaries.

In the event that we are unable to receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.

**_Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events_**
**_beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our results of_**
**_operations and our financial condition._**

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the
holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable
immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under
our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance
or restructure our indebtedness under our senior secured debt, including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default
or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of
our other debt instruments.

**_Prior to or when the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature, we may not be able to refinance or replace them._**

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities have an earlier maturity date than the notes. Prior to or when New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature, we may need to refinance them and may not be able to do so on favorable
terms or at all. If we are able to refinance maturing indebtedness, the terms of any refinancing or alternate credit
arrangements may contain terms and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility. If we are unable to
refinance the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities prior to or when they mature, it could result in an event of default
under the agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Moreover, the occurrence of an event
of default under the credit agreement that will govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities could result in an event
of default under our other indebtedness, including the indenture that will govern the notes.

**_Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries_**
**_that will not guarantee the notes._**

The notes will not be guaranteed by certain of our existing and future subsidiaries. Only Parent and our
existing wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities will initially guarantee the notes upon consummation of the Merger. As of the closing date of the
Merger, none of our foreign subsidiaries will guarantee the notes, and no such subsidiaries are expected to guarantee
the notes in the future. Claims of holders of the notes will be structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors of
these non-guarantor subsidiaries and trade creditors, and will not be satisfied from the assets of these non-guarantor
subsidiaries until their creditors are paid in full. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries
represented approximately 26.8% of our revenues, 26.4% of our total assets and 8.9% of our total liabilities.

In addition, the guarantee of certain guarantors will be released in connection with a transfer of such guarantor
in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes or upon certain other events described in
“Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

The indenture that will govern the notes offered hereby will permit these non-guarantor subsidiaries to incur
certain additional debt and will not limit their ability to incur other liabilities that are not considered indebtedness
thereunder.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults and amendments taken under the indenture governing the notes by beneficial_**
**_owners, including those with short positions in excess of their interests in the notes, will be disregarded._**

By acceptance of the notes, each holder of notes (other than screened affiliates and regulated banks) agrees,
in connection with any notice of default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent to provide a notice of default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to (i)
deliver a written representation to the Issuer, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent that such holder and any of
its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its investment in the notes (other than screened affiliates and
regulated banks) are not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely
by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under the headings “Description
of Notes”) with respect to the notes and (ii) provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably
request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s representation within five business days of
request therefor. These restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions if it is unable
to make such a representation.

In addition, for purposes of determining whether the required number of holders have (i) consented (or not
consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the
indenture that governs the notes, (ii) otherwise acted on any matter related to the indenture that governs the notes or
(iii) directed or required the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, or any holder to undertake any action with respect to
or under the indenture that governs the notes, all notes held or beneficially owned by a holder or a beneficial owner
(together with its affiliates) may not account for more than 20.0% of the notes included in determining whether the
required number of holders have consented to any action (the “Voting Cap”). All notes held by any holder or beneficial
owner or any affiliate of such holder or beneficial owner in excess of the Voting Cap shall be deemed to not be
outstanding for all purposes of calculating whether the required number holders have taken any action (or refrained
from taking any action) or provided any consent or waiver with respect to the notes, subject to certain exceptions.
These restrictions may impact a holder’s or beneficial owner’s ability to participate in a voting decision if such holder
or beneficial owner and its affiliates own a large amount of notes.

**_Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will not apply to us if the notes are rated_**
**_investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P._**

Many of the covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes will cease to apply to the notes during such
time, if any, as the notes are rated investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P, provided that at such time no default
or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Although there can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated
investment grade, or if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain these ratings, any suspension of
the covenants under the indenture that will govern the notes would allow us to engage in certain transactions that
would not be permitted while these covenants were in effect. To the extent any suspended covenants are subsequently
reinstated, any actions taken by us while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under
the indenture that will govern the notes on the basis that such actions would have been prohibited by the covenants.
See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.”

**_Sales of assets by the Issuer and the guarantors could reduce the Collateral and the related guarantees._**

The security documents that will relate to the notes offered hereby will allow the Issuer and the guarantors
to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income
from, the Collateral. To the extent the Issuer or a guarantor sells any assets that constitute Collateral, the proceeds
from such sale will be subject to the liens securing the notes offered hereby and the related guarantees only to the
extent such proceeds would otherwise constitute Collateral securing the notes offered hereby and the related
guarantees under the security documents. Such proceeds will also be subject to the security interests of certain creditors
other than the holders of the notes offered hereby, some of which may be senior or prior to the liens held by the holders
of the notes, or may have a lien in those assets that is equal priority with the lien of the holders of the notes (including,
without limitation, the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities). To the extent the proceeds from any sale of Collateral
do not constitute Collateral under the security documents, the pool of assets securing the notes and the related
guarantees will be reduced, and the notes and the related guarantees will not be secured by such proceeds.


-----

**_The value of the Collateral securing the notes offered hereby and the related guarantees may not be sufficient to_**
**_satisfy our obligations under the notes._**

Upon the consummation of the Merger, from and after the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, if
applicable, the notes and the related guarantees will be secured, together with the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
by equal priority liens on the Collateral (as defined in the “Description of the Notes”).

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of the notes, and
the fair market value of the Collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others,
changing economic conditions, competition and other future trends. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may
be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy
or similar proceeding, the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of the notes will be
entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of the Collateral before any payment is made in respect of any other
indebtedness that is secured by a junior lien on the Collateral or that is unsecured. Moreover, the lenders under the
New Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by an equal priority lien on
the Collateral will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the holders of the notes, thereby diluting the
Collateral coverage available to holders of the notes. In particular, the fair market value of the Collateral may not be
sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and
after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the Collateral, if any. There also can be no assurance
that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly,
there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference
between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the
obligations under the notes and other obligations secured by an equal priority lien on the Collateral will rank equally
in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including
trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to receive postpetition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under
the notes exceeded the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other equal priority debt that was also
secured by the Collateral, including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities), or any “adequate protection” on
account of any undersecured portion of the notes. See “—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the
guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s
obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the notes and the related
guarantees.”

With respect to some of the Collateral, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent and its ability to
foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents and
making additional filings. If the Issuer is unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests
may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot
assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit
the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either
of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of
realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited.

Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuer will be permitted to incur indebtedness
in amounts in excess of the current commitments under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The indenture that
will govern the notes will also permit the Issuer and the guarantors to create additional liens on the Collateral under
specified circumstances, some of which liens may be equal priority with or senior to the liens securing the notes. Any
obligations secured by such liens may further dilute the collateral coverage and limit the recovery from the realization
of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the notes. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Liens.”

**_Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a senior-priority lien on the Collateral, the collateral agent_**
**_under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will initially control actions with respect to that Collateral pursuant_**
**_to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral that will secure the notes on a seniorpriority basis will be subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement among all holders of obligations secured
by such Collateral on an equal priority basis, including the obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.


-----

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such Collateral,
including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Collateral and to control
such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the collateral agent under New Senior Secured Credit Facilities
until the earlier of (1) the date on which the Issuer’s obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are
discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities) or (2)
120 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture that will govern the notes and acceleration of
the obligations thereunder, if the notes represent the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by
an equal priority lien on the Collateral (other than the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and the Notes Collateral
Agent has complied with the applicable notice provisions so long as the agent under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities has not commenced and is not then diligently pursuing the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral or
any portion thereof or the Issuer or any guarantor is not then a debtor in any bankruptcy or similar insolvency or
liquidation proceeding.

After the discharge of the obligations with respect to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the right to
direct the actions with respect to the Collateral securing the notes will pass to the authorized representative of holders
of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by an equal priority lien on the Collateral. If
the Issuer issues additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the Issuer’s notes in the future in
a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would
be next in line to exercise rights under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral
Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions
with respect to the Collateral.

In addition, under the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling
collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the
lien securing the notes on such Collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds
from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding equal priority obligations). The Collateral so released
will no longer secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the related guarantees. The
holders of the notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy,
as the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the trustee for the notes and the Notes Collateral Agent
from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be
provided to us that is secured by the Collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected
to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited
exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes would
be unable to raise an objection.

Also, under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain
possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any Collateral at any time prior to the
discharge of each of the other equal priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral,
proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of equal priority obligations and, subject to the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement, promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the
controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement among all the holders of equal priority obligations. Thus, there can be no assurances that under the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the notes would not be obligated to turn over to the other holders of
the equal priority obligations any Collateral, proceeds or payments they may receive. Finally, holders of the notes will
waive certain rights otherwise accruing to them as secured creditors in bankruptcy under the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Pledges of equity interests of certain of the Issuer’s foreign subsidiaries may not constitute Collateral for the_**
**_repayment of the notes because such pledges may not be perfected pursuant to foreign law pledge documents._**

Part of the security for the repayment of the notes may consist of a pledge of up to 65% of the voting stock
of each direct foreign subsidiary of the Issuer. Although such a pledge of capital stock will be required to be granted
under U.S. security documents, it may be necessary or desirable to perfect such pledges under foreign law pledge
documents. The Issuer will not be required to provide such foreign law pledge documents. Unless and until such
pledges of equity interests are properly perfected, they may not constitute Collateral for the repayment of the notes.


-----

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

The Issuer’s obligations under the notes and the guarantors’ obligations under the guarantees are secured
only by the Collateral described in this offering memorandum. The Notes Collateral Agent’s ability to foreclose on
the Collateral on behalf of the holders of the notes may be subject to perfection, priority issues, state law requirements,
applicable bankruptcy law, and practical problems associated with the realization of the Notes Collateral Agent’s
security interest in or lien on the Collateral, including cure rights, foreclosing on the Collateral within the time periods
permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents, making additional filings, statutory
rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot assure you that the consents of any third
parties and approvals by governmental entities or courts of competent jurisdiction will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that foreclosure on the Collateral will be
sufficient to make all payments on the notes.

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to create or perfect the_**
**_security interests._**

The Collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees will include substantially all of the Issuer’s and
the guarantors’ tangible and intangible assets which assets also secure the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ indebtedness
under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, whether now owned or acquired or arising in the future. Applicable
law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its
priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the Collateral securing the notes
may not be perfected if we are not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date
of the issuance of the notes or thereafter. We will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders
of the notes in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements. To the extent a security interest in
certain Collateral is not properly perfected on the date of the issuance of the notes, such security interest might be
avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the Collateral. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or
guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

If additional wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors
under the indenture that will govern notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the
security interest for the notes in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting afteracquired collateral, additional action may be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law
requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at
the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the trustee for the notes nor the Notes Collateral
Agent will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer will inform the trustee for the notes
or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the
necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of the
trustee for the notes, the Notes Collateral Agent or the collateral agent for the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities
will have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or monitor
the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interests therein. Such
inaction may result in the loss of the security interest in such Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor
of the notes and the guarantees against third parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent’s liens on Collateral acquired
or arising in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any
bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be
avoidable in bankruptcy.”

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the Collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the notes and guarantees thereof
will reveal any or all existing liens on the Collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be
significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and guarantees thereof and could have an adverse
effect on the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the notes and
guarantees thereof.


-----

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and customary
for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, in
whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss
or impairment in value of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the
secured obligations, including the notes and the related guarantees.

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens will, under certain circumstances, permit the liens on the related assets_**
**_securing the notes and the related guarantees to be either subordinated to such permitted liens or released. There_**
**_are also certain other assets that are also excluded from the Collateral._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure additional debt,
including purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and, in the case of certain of such liens, the liens
on the related assets securing the notes and the related guarantees may, under certain circumstances, be either
subordinated to such permitted liens or released. Our ability to incur additional debt and liens on such additional debt
in favor of third parties is subject to limitations as described herein under the headings “Description of Notes.” In
addition, certain assets are excluded from the Collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees, as discussed
under “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes.” If an event of default occurs and the maturity of the notes is
accelerated, the notes and the related guarantees will rank equal priority with the holders of other unsecured or senior
indebtedness of the relevant obligor with respect to such excluded assets. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged
as security for the notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the notes, those claims may not be satisfied
in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the_**
**_guarantees, and the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes,_**
**_the guarantees and the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to_**
**_return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive_**
**_any payments on the notes._**

The issuance of the notes and the guarantees and, in the case of the notes and the related guarantees, the grant
of liens by the Issuer and the guarantors (including any future guarantees and future liens) may be subject to review
under federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes if a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization case
or a lawsuit, including under circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were commenced at some future date
by the Issuer, by the guarantors or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor. While the
relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and
the guarantees and, in the case of the notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens will generally be a fraudulent
conveyance if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees or, in the case of the notes and the
related guarantees, the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other
creditors or (ii) the Issuer or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or
fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the related
guarantees, the granting of liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true:

    - the Issuer or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or
the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the notes and the related guarantees);

    - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the notes and the
related guarantees) left the Issuer or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital
to carry on the business in which such Issuer or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or

    - the Issuer or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our
or its ability to pay as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the related
guarantees, the grant of liens was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the


-----

notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness
of such Issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the
notes or such guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the related guarantees, void the granting of liens to secure the
notes or the related guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive
any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our
other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the law of the
jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine
whether or not the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court
uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments
to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the
Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt.

Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation,
property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor
did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee and/or lien if the
Issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the
applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to
the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the
guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens in the case of
the notes), subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of
the notes.

To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees
unenforceable for any other reason, (x) the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable
guarantor or (y) in the case of liens granted to secure the notes or the related guarantees, the holders of notes would
cease to have a secured claim against the Issuer or the guarantors, as applicable. If a court were to take this action, the
applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and
might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from
other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts
that you already received from the Issuer or the applicable guarantor.

Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit
that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations
under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those
guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation
to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a
guarantee made at a time such Issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be
returned to the Issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such
payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside


-----

party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have received in a
distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the
notes or the guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the guarantors under the principle of equitable
subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct;
(ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder
of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Collateral pledged or guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under bankruptcy law
as if they were pledged to secure or delivered to guarantee, as applicable, previously existing indebtedness. Any future
pledge of Collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes (including any Liens delivered or
reinstated after the Reversion Date and/or pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the
notes are issued) may be avoidable by the pledgor (as a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession),
by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including,
among others, if (1) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee,
(2) the pledge and/or issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater
recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge and/or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and
(3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge
or the perfection thereof and/or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer
period. Accordingly, if the Issuer or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the
notes and any pledge of Collateral not pledged, or any guarantees not issued on the issue date of the notes had been
pledged or perfected or issued (as applicable) less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding,
such pledges or guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if
delivered on the issue date of the notes (even if the other guarantees or liens (as applicable) issued on the issue date
of the notes would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or
guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee
(as applicable).

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing
the notes and the related guarantees is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by federal
bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against the Issuer or the guarantors that provide
security for the notes or the related guarantees prior to, or possibly even after, any collateral agent has repossessed
and disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral
Agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from
disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not
be given under the circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use
collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the
applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the
term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value
of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or
replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of
the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor
during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require
compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In
view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and
the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under
the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any
such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes Collateral
Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral as of the commencement date
of any bankruptcy proceedings, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the notes would be


-----

compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate
protection.”

**_Furthermore, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of business_**
**_would also require approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances)._**

Also, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay
all amounts due on the notes and all of our other outstanding Equal Priority Obligations (as defined under the heading
“Description of Notes”), the holders of the notes would be “undersecured.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do not provide for
the payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees on the “undersecured” portion of a creditor
claims during a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any
undersecured portion of its claims.

In addition, as noted above, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the trustee for the notes
and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-inpossession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the Collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not
been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to
certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate,
and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection.

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to have_**
**_an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value_**
**_of the Collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any of the guarantors that have guaranteed the
notes, it is possible that the bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair
market value of the Collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the thencurrent principal amount of the notes and all of our other outstanding Equal Priority Obligations. Upon a finding by
the bankruptcy court that the notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to
the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be
entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the notes would
be limited to the value of the Collateral.

The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of
entitlement on the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of
entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy
laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a
finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of
the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes.

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us in the United States, the allowed claim for the notes may
be less than the principal amount of the notes stated in the indenture.

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the
notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount thereof may be allowed in an amount equal to the
sum of:

    - the original issue price of the notes; and

    - that portion of the stated principal amount of the notes that exceeds the issue price thereof, if any, that
does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute unmatured
interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, holders


-----

of the notes under these circumstances may receive an amount that is less than the principal amount thereof stated in
the indenture.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantees may be reduced to zero, voided or released under certain_**
**_circumstances, holders of notes may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

Holders of notes have the benefit of the guarantees of the guarantors. However, the guarantees by the
guarantors are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law.
As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending upon the amount of other
obligations of such guarantor. Further, under the circumstances discussed more fully above, a court under federal or
state fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee (and any related security
interest) or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantor. See “—Federal and state fraudulent transfer
laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and the liens securing the notes
and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing the notes
and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the
guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” In addition, you will
lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of
Notes—Guarantees.”

**_We may not be able to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required by the indenture that will_**
**_govern the notes._**

Upon a change of control, as defined under the indenture that will govern the notes, you will have the right
to require the Issuer to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In order to obtain sufficient
funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the notes. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the notes on reasonable terms, if at all. The Issuer’s failure to
offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the
indenture that will govern the notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt, including
debt under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our future debt also may contain restrictions on repayment
requirements with respect to specified events or transactions that constitute a change of control under the indenture
that will govern the notes.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain specified asset sales, the Issuer will be required to offer to purchase
outstanding notes and indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, at 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. The source of funds for any
such purchase of the notes will be the Issuer’s available cash or cash generated from the Issuer’s operations or other
sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuer may not be able to purchase the notes upon
such an asset sale offer because the Issuer may not have sufficient financial resources at the time of such asset sale to
make the required purchase of notes and such other indebtedness, or because restrictions in the Issuer’s other
indebtedness will not allow such purchase of the notes. Any of the Issuer’s future debt agreements may contain similar
provisions. Accordingly, if such an asset sale were to occur, the Issuer may not have sufficient financial resources to
purchase the notes and such other indebtedness that the Issuer would be required to offer to purchase or that become
immediately due and payable as a result. The Issuer may require additional financing from third parties to fund any
such purchases, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all.
See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.” The Issuer’s failure to pay holders
tendering notes and such other indebtedness upon such an asset sale would result in an event of default under the
indenture that will govern the notes.

**_We can enter into transactions like recapitalizations, reorganizations and other highly leveraged transactions that_**
**_do not constitute a change of control but that could adversely affect the holders of the notes._**

Certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations, may not, under the indenture that
will govern the notes, constitute a “change of control” that would require the Issuer to purchase the notes,
notwithstanding the fact that such corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely
affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the notes. Therefore, we could, in the future, enter into certain


-----

transactions, including acquisitions, reorganizations, refinancings or other recapitalizations, which would not
constitute a change of control under the indenture that will govern the notes, but that could increase the amount of
indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.

**_Holders of notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the notes_**
**_purchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the indenture that will govern the notes includes a phrase relating to
the sale of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially
all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of notes to require the Issuer to purchase its notes as a
result of a sale of less than all of our assets to another person may be uncertain. See “Description of Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

**_An active trading market may not develop for the notes._**

The notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. We cannot assure you
that an active trading market for the notes will develop and continue after this offering. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system. Although we have been
informed by certain of the initial purchasers that they currently intend to make a market for the notes, they are not
obliged to do so and any market making may be discontinued at any time without notice. In addition, the ability of the
initial purchasers to make a market in the notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including
as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act
(“Rule 15c2-11”) and its application to debt securities) applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing
quotations with respect to, the notes. The recent amendments to Rule 15c2-11 and regulatory interpretations thereof
by the SEC could restrict the ability of brokers and dealers to publish quotations on the notes being offered hereby on
any interdealer quotation system or other quotation medium after January 4, 2025.

Furthermore, the liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be adversely affected by, among
other things:

    - changes in the overall market for securities similar to the notes;

    - changes in our financial performance or prospects;

    - the prospects for companies in our industry generally;

    - the number of holders of the notes;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

    - the conditions of the financial markets; and

    - prevailing interest rates.

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely
to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the notes.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities that are similar to the notes. We cannot assure you that the market, if
any, for any of the notes will be free from similar disruptions or that any such disruptions may not adversely affect
the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our
performance and other factors.


-----

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights and the Issuer does not currently intend to register_**
**_the notes under applicable securities laws, and there are restrictions on transfer on your ability to transfer or resell_**
**_the notes._**

The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction
registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities
laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. The Issuer is not
obligated, and does not intend, to register the notes under the Securities Act or to offer to exchange the notes in an
exchange offer registered under the Securities Act. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require the Issuer
to register the notes for resale or otherwise. As a result, for so long as the notes remain outstanding, they may be
transferred or resold only in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of federal and applicable state
securities laws.

**_The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be_**
**_required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The indenture that will govern the notes will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not
be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the notes will not be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are similar
provisions in the indenture that will govern the notes.

**_A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may adversely affect the_**
**_market price or liquidity of the notes._**

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit
rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall
view of our industry. The notes offered hereby will have a non-investment grade rating on the issue date. There can
be no assurances that such rating will remain for any given period of time or that such rating will not be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis
of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell
the notes, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect
of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the notes. If the credit rating of the notes is subsequently lowered or
withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your notes without a substantial discount.

**_The lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release any guarantor under_**
**_the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause such guarantor to be_**
**_released from its guarantee of the notes, in which case any liens on the assets of such guarantor in favor of the_**
**_New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes offered hereby will also be released._**

While any obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding, a guarantor’s
guarantee of the notes may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the trustee under
the indenture that will govern the notes, at the discretion of Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as administrative
agent and collateral agent under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “Bank Agent”) or the lenders under the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, if the guarantor no longer guarantees obligations under the New Senior Secured
Credit Facilities or any other indebtedness. See “Description of Notes.” The Bank Agent or the lenders under the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantees under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer
a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or
unsecured, of those non-guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally senior to claims of noteholders.


-----

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically. The guarantee of a
subsidiary guarantor of the notes will be automatically released to the extent such subsidiary guarantor is released in
connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not
prohibited by the indenture that will govern the notes. The indenture also will permit us to designate one or more of
the Issuer’s restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the
guarantee of such subsidiary guarantor being automatically released. If a subsidiary guarantor is released from its
guarantee of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or certain other indebtedness of the Issuer or any other
guarantor, other than in connection with a refinancing of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and such other
indebtedness or a payment under such guarantee, or a guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure
of any pledge or security interest securing the secured indebtedness, such subsidiary’s guarantee of the notes will be
automatically released as well, in which case any liens on the assets of such subsidiary in favor of the New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and the notes offered hereby will also be released. If the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor
is released, no holder of the notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and
other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary
will be structurally senior to the claim of any holders of the notes. For a description of all circumstances in which a
guarantor’s subsidiary guarantee will be automatically released, see “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_There are circumstances, other than the repayment or discharge of the notes, under which the Collateral and the_**
**_related guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Notes Collateral_**
**_Agent, and you may not realize any payment upon the release of such Collateral._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral and related guarantees will be released automatically, including:

    - upon a sale, transfer or other disposition of such Collateral (to a person that is not the Issuer or a
guarantor) in a transaction not prohibited under the indenture that will govern the notes. See “Description
of Notes—Release of Collateral”;

    - with respect to the equity interests of and Collateral held by a guarantor of the notes, upon the release of
such guarantor from its guarantees;

    - pursuant to the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, upon any release in connection with
a foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to such Collateral by the controlling collateral agent
in accordance with the terms of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement;

    - upon the release of Excess Proceeds that remain unexpended after the conclusion of an Asset Sale Offer
conducted in accordance with the Indenture (each capitalized term as defined under “Description of
Notes”);

    - if all other liens on such Collateral securing Equal Priority Obligations are released or will be released
simultaneously therewith;

    - if the release of such lien is approved, authorized or ratified by the required number of holders;

    - to the extent such Collateral becomes an Excluded Asset; and

    - if the notes would be rated investment grade by either Moody’s or S&P after giving effect to such lien
release. See “Description of Notes—Security for the Notes—Release of Collateral.”

The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit us to designate one or more of the Issuer’s restricted
subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If the Issuer designates a subsidiary guarantor
as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the indenture that will govern the notes, all of the liens on the equity
interests of and any Collateral owned by that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the notes by


-----

that subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the indenture that will govern the notes. Designation
of an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the notes to the extent that liens
on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of any such
unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its
subsidiaries senior to the claim of the holders of the notes.

**_Upon consummation of the Merger, we will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002._**

Since we will not register the notes under the Securities Act after the consummation of the Merger, Cvent
will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies to have and maintain effective
disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review
the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires public companies to
have and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review the
effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of such
internal controls). Following the Merger, we (and Cvent) will not be required to comply with these requirements and
therefore may not have comparable procedures in place as compared to public companies.

**_If the Liens securing the notes are released as a result of an Investment Grade Event, as defined under the heading_**
**_“Description of Notes,” the notes will become unsecured and no Liens will be granted unless the Notes have a_**
**_lower than investment grade rating from each of Moody’s and S&P._**

If the Liens securing the notes are released as a result of an Investment Grade Event, the notes will become
unsecured and no Liens will be granted unless the Notes have a lower than investment grade rating from each of
Moody’s and S&P. Any pledge of collateral in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and the other security documents
delivered after such date, could be avoidable in bankruptcy and if this were to occur, holders of the notes could lose
the benefit of such security interest. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in
bankruptcy.”

**_The terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities have not been finalized._**

The agreement relating to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities has not been finalized. The Issuer’s ability
to successfully syndicate the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities is subject to market conditions, and the Issuer
cannot assure you that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be successfully syndicated on the terms described
herein. Future changes in market conditions may result in changes to the terms for the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, including pricing, that are less favorable to the Issuer and may increase the Issuer’s interest expense and
adversely affect our business. The terms of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities could also change in a way that
increases the Issuer’s indebtedness or makes it easier to incur debt in the future.

**_In the event that the Merger is not consummated on or before the Outside Date and the other Escrow Release_**
**_Conditions are not satisfied or the terms of the Escrow Agreement are not otherwise complied with, the notes will_**
**_be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption, and as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the_**
**_notes._**

If the Merger is not consummated simultaneously with this offering, concurrently with the closing of this
offering, the Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be
deposited) an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the offering into an escrow account for the notes until the date
that the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied. The funds in such escrow account will be initially limited to the
gross proceeds from the offering and will not be sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Pending
the consummation of the Merger, one or more funds or limited partnerships managed or advised by affiliates of the
Sponsors will either (i) deposit (or cause the Issuer to deposit) funds into the escrow account in an amount sufficient
to pay accrued interest on the notes each month in advance or (ii) commit to pay or guarantee to fund any accrued and
unpaid interest owing to the holders of the notes plus other amounts needed to discharge the indenture in the event of
a Special Mandatory Redemption.


-----

If, among other things, the Merger is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, the Issuer will redeem,
on the Special Mandatory Redemption Date in accordance with the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes,
all of the notes at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. Upon such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest
the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. Additionally, you may suffer a loss
on your investment if you purchase the notes at a price greater than the issue price of the notes. See “Description of
Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Although the trustee, for the benefit of the
holders of the notes, will be granted a senior-priority lien on such funds, the ability of holders of the notes to realize
upon the funds in the escrow account may be subject to certain bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy
of the Issuer.

**_Between the time of the offering of the notes and the consummation of the Merger, the parties to the Merger_**
**_Agreement may agree to modify or waive the terms or conditions of such document without consent of the Holders_**
**_of notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the parties to the Merger Agreement may agree to amendments or
waivers of the terms thereof. Although the Escrow Agreement will provide as a condition to the release of the funds
in the escrow account that the Merger is to be consummated, this condition will not preclude the transaction parties
from making changes to the terms of the transactions or from waiving conditions to the transactions that have an
adverse effect on the holders of the notes, including a change in the purchase price or to the structure of the Merger.

**_If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case or one is commenced against the Issuer, bankruptcy_**
**_laws may prevent the release of the escrowed funds._**

If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case, or one is commenced against the Issuer, while
amounts remain in the escrow account, applicable bankruptcy laws may prevent the Escrow Agent from releasing the
funds in the escrow account or applying those funds to effect a Special Mandatory Redemption of the notes or
otherwise applying those funds for the benefit of itself and the holders of the notes. The court adjudicating that case
might find that such escrow account is the property of the bankruptcy estate. Although the amounts in the escrow
account will be pledged as collateral for payment, if required, of the Special Mandatory Redemption Price of the notes,
the automatic stay provisions of the federal bankruptcy laws generally prohibit secured creditors from foreclosing
upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without bankruptcy court approval. As a result, holders of the notes may not
be able to have the funds in the escrow account applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the indenture
that will govern the notes and could suffer a loss as a result.

In addition, if the court adjudicating the Issuer’s bankruptcy or reorganization case finds that the escrowed
funds are property of the bankruptcy estate, the court could authorize the use of these funds by the bankruptcy estate
or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without restrictions. As a result, the holders of the notes could
become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate. In such event, the only remedy available to the holders of the
notes would be to sue for payment on such notes.

**_Prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Issuer and the guarantors of the notes (Parent and Merger Sub) will_**
**_have limited assets and Cvent will not have any obligations under the notes and Cvent will not be subject to the_**
**_restrictive covenants in the indenture that will govern the notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Merger, holders of the notes will not have any recourse to Cvent, as the
notes will only be the obligations of the Issuer, Parent and Merger Sub. These entities do not conduct any material
operations and have no material assets (other than the escrowed proceeds). In the event of a bankruptcy of any of these
entities prior to the consummation of the Merger, holders of the notes will have a secured claim as to the funds
deposited into the escrow account and an unsecured claim to any other assets of each of the Issuer, Parent and Merger
Sub and will not have any recourse to any assets of Cvent. Prior to the consummation of the Merger, Cvent will not
be subject to any of the covenants set forth in the indenture that will govern the notes. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Cvent and its subsidiaries generally are required to operate in the ordinary course of business prior to the
consummation of the Merger.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The table below sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions (and
after the gross proceeds from this offering are released from escrow, if applicable), assuming they occurred on March
31, 2023, and based on estimated amounts outstanding on that date. Actual amounts will vary from the estimated
amounts shown below depending on several factors, including, among others, the amount of existing debt to be
refinanced, incremental cash added to the balance sheet, changes made to the sources of the contemplated financings,
the number of shares of capital stock and equity awards outstanding on the closing date of the Merger and differences
in our fees and expenses.

If the Merger is not consummated simultaneously with this offering, the gross proceeds of this offering will
be funded into escrow and, upon release of the funds from escrow, the proceeds from this offering will be used to fund
a portion of the Transactions as set forth below or, if applicable, will be used to fund the Special Mandatory
Redemption as described herein. See “Summary—The Transactions—Escrow.”

Certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may be agents and/or lenders under the Existing Credit
Facility and may therefore receive a portion of the net proceeds from the offering used to repay any such indebtedness.
See “Plan of Distribution—Other Relationships.”

You should read the following together with the information included under the headings “Summary—The

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023 and the
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, the three
months ended March 31, 2022, the three months ended March 31, 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2023
are based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Cvent incorporated by reference into this offering
memorandum. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information gives effect to the Transactions
as if they had occurred on (i) March 31, 2023 for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance
sheet, and (ii) on January 1, 2022 for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, the three months ended March 31, 2022, the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

Pro forma adjustments for the Transactions were made primarily to reflect:

    - the Merger;

    - the Equity Financing, the cash portion of which will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions and to
pay related fees and expenses;

    - the use of proceeds of this offering and the borrowings under the New Term Loan Facility, which will
be used to fund a portion of the Transactions, repay the Existing Credit Facility, and to pay related fees
and expenses, including changes in interest expense resulting therefrom;

    - transaction costs and fees incurred as a result of the Transactions; and

    - changes in the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities to reflect their estimated fair values at the
date of closing of the Merger, including values assigned to intangible assets and related changes in
amortization expenses.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that are
factually supportable and that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial information are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what
our actual consolidated statement of operations or consolidated balance sheet would have been had the Transactions
actually occurred on the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations
or consolidated financial condition. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information should
be read in conjunction with the information contained in “Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” and the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto incorporated by reference into
this offering memorandum, as well as the information included under the “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements,” “—The Transactions,” “Risk Factors” and “Capitalization”. All pro forma adjustments and their
underlying assumptions are described more fully in the notes to our unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial information.

The acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The pro forma information
presented, including the allocation of the purchase price, is based on preliminary estimates of the fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, available information as of the date of this offering memorandum and our
assumptions, and will be revised as additional information becomes available. The final purchase price allocation is
dependent on, among other things, the finalization of the preliminary asset and liability valuations by our independent
valuation firm. The actual adjustments to our combined financial statements upon the closing of the Transactions will
depend on a number of factors, including additional information available and the actual balance of our net assets on
the closing date. Therefore, the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments, and the differences
may be material. Any final adjustments will change the allocation of the purchase price, which could affect the fair
value assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a change to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial data, including a change to goodwill. Pro forma earnings per share have not been presented because we do
not believe such information is relevant to prospective investors of the notes offered hereby.

**Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet**
**(in thousands)**

(1) Reflects adjustments related to the equity purchase price. For a table illustrating the estimated sources and uses of cash in connection with the
Transactions, see “Use of Proceeds.”

(2) Reflects the estimated goodwill from the preliminary purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2023, resulting from the Merger. For purposes
of determining the purchase price allocation, the fair market value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
estimated as of March 31, 2023. Except for the specific fair value adjustments discussed in the notes hereto, we have assumed that our
historical carrying value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed reflect fair value. The estimates below are based on preliminary valuation
studies utilizing discounted cash flow techniques and comparable market values for similar transactions in the industry. The final purchase
price allocation will be based on an appraisal subsequent to the consummation of the Merger and any change in the final allocation of the
purchase price to the assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed could materially affect the amount of recorded goodwill.

The preliminary allocation of purchase price is as follows:

Acquisition purchase price ..................................................................................... $ 4,372,780
Refinancing of existing debt .................................................................................. 138,000
Total consideration transferred .............................................................................. 4,510,780
**Allocated to:**

Cash and cash equivalents .................................................................................. 102,220

Prepaid expenses and other current assets .......................................................... 24,759
Property and equipment...................................................................................... 14,577
Developed technology ........................................................................................ 606,000
Intangible assets ................................................................................................. 1,661,000
Operating lease right-of-use assets ..................................................................... 28,453
Deferred tax assets, non-current ......................................................................... 2,440
Other assets, non-current .................................................................................... 2,884
Accounts payable ............................................................................................... (2,804)
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities ................................................... (75,506)

Operating lease liabilities, current ...................................................................... (11,121)
Deferred revenue ................................................................................................ (302,216)
Deferred tax liabilities, non-current .................................................................... (544,031)
Operating lease liabilities, non-current ............................................................... (26,790)
Other liabilities, non-current .............................................................................. (6,413)

**Preliminary fair value of net assets acquired .................................................** **1,563,288**

**Preliminary allocation to goodwill ......................................................................** **$ 2,947,492**

A summary of the effects of the preliminary purchase price allocation to goodwill is as follows:

**Transaction**

**Historic net** **Estimated** **Accounting**
**Book Value** **Fair Value** **Adjustment**

Goodwill ................................................................................................................ $   1,620,270 $ 2,947,492 $  1,327,222

Upon completion of the fair value assessment after the Merger, it is anticipated that the ultimate purchase price allocation will differ from the
preliminary assessment outlined above. Any changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities
will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized.

(3) Reflects the estimated fair value of capitalized commissions from the preliminary purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2023 resulting
from the Merger. The costs incurred to obtain a customer will be reflected in the value of the customer relationship intangible asset. A
summary of the effects of the preliminary purchase price allocation to the capitalized commissions is as follows:

**Transaction**

**Historic net** **Estimated** **Accounting**
**Book Value** **Fair Value** **Adjustment**

Current ................................................................................................................... $    27,473 — $  (27,473)

Capitalized commissions, net ................................................................................. **$    51,301** **—** **$  (51,301)**


-----

(4) Reflects the estimated value of developed technology from the preliminary purchase price allocation as of March 31, 2023 resulting from
the Merger. A summary of the effects of the preliminary purchase price allocation to developed technology is as follows:

**Transaction**

**Historic net** **Estimated** **Accounting**
**Book Value** **Fair Value** **Adjustment**

Developed technology, gross ................................................................................ $   398,644 $  606,000 $   207,356
Less: Accumulated amortization - capitalized software ........................................ (305,885) — 305,885

**Developed technology, net ..................................................................................** **$    92,759** **$  606,000** **$   513,241**

The fair value assigned to developed technology has been estimated based on preliminary valuation studies utilizing discounted cash flow
techniques and comparable market values for similar transactions in the industry. The final purchase price allocation will be based on an
appraisal subsequent to the consummation of the Merger and may result in a materially different allocation for developed technology than
that presented in this unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet. Any change in the amount of the final purchase price
allocated to developed technology could materially affect the amount of amortization expense.

(5) Reflects the estimated identifiable intangible assets other than developed technology from the preliminary purchase price allocation as of
March 31, 2023 resulting from the Merger. A summary of the effects of the preliminary purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible
assets excluding developed technology is as follows:

**Transaction**

**Historic net** **Estimated** **Accounting**
**Book Value** **Fair Value** **Adjustment**

Customer relationships ......................................................................................... $   433,832 $ 1,479,000 $ 1,045,168
Trademarks ........................................................................................................... 82,235 182,000 99,765
Indefinite-lived intangibles ................................................................................... 62 — (62)
Intangible assets (excl. developed technology), gross ........................................... 516,129 1,661,000 1,144,871
Less: Accumulated amortization (excl. capitalized software) ............................... (355,053) — 355,053

**Intangible assets (excl. developed technology), net ...........................................** **$   161,076** **$  1,661,000** **$ 1,499,924**

The fair value assigned to the identifiable intangible assets has been estimated based on preliminary valuation studies utilizing discounted
cash flow techniques and comparable market values for similar transactions in the industry. The final purchase price allocation will be based
on an appraisal subsequent to the consummation of the Merger and may result in a materially different allocation for intangible assets than
that presented in this unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet. Any change in the amount of the final purchase price
allocated to amortizable, finite-lived intangible assets could materially affect the amount of amortization expense.

(6) Reflects the adjustments of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relating to the revaluation of such amounts as a result of purchase
accounting. The pro forma adjustment to deferred income taxes reflects the tax effect of the planned transaction, which results in the release
of certain valuation allowances offsetting the additional deferred tax liabilities associated with identified intangibles.

The Company recorded additional deferred tax liabilities related to identified intangibles acquired in the transaction of $661.7 million. The
Company also released the cumulative deferred tax liability of $11.9 million related to capitalized commissions and released Federal and state
valuation allowances of $123.9 million. This resulted in a net increase in deferred tax liabilities of $525.9 million.

**Transaction**

**Historic net** **Accounting**
**Book Value** **Pro Forma** **Adjustment**

Non-current deferred tax liabilities ....................................................................... $   18,126 $  544,031 $  525,905

(7) The following table presents our estimated long-term debt outstanding, net of estimated original issue discount on our New Term Loan Facility
and deferred financing costs that we expect to incur in connection with borrowing under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the
notes offered hereby, immediately following consummation of the Transactions on a pro forma basis. Transaction accounting adjustments
related to the Existing Credit Facilities represent the repayment of amounts owed as of March 31, 2023. Capitalized financing costs on the
Existing Credit Facilities are recorded within Other assets, non-current, net on the historical condensed consolidated balance sheet and have
been eliminated in conjunction with the payoff of the Existing Credit Facilities.

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities ...................................................... $    88,993 $   75,506 $  (13,487)

(9) This adjustment reflects (1) the elimination of our historical equity which will be replaced by the Preferred Equity and Sponsor’s Equity
Financing, and (2) a reduction for estimated non-recurring transaction-related costs of $98 million. As discussed in (8) above, $13 million of
the transaction costs were expensed prior to March 31, 2023, with the remaining transaction costs expected to be expensed on the Closing
Date.

A formal analysis regarding the appropriate accounting classification of the Preferred Equity will be conducted subsequent to the
consummation of the Merger and the final determination may result in classification within mezzanine equity or stockholder’s equity.

offered hereby (see “Description of Other Financing Arrangements”) and (ii) the assumption that our New Revolving Credit Facility will be
undrawn at the closing of the Merger and (2) the amortization of approximately $4.5 million per year of estimated capitalized financing costs
for our newly issued debt and original issue discount associated with our New Term Loan Facility. To the extent the actual interest rates are
higher than estimated, additional interest expense will be incurred and such expense could be material. Assuming our New Term Loan Facility
is fully drawn (and to the extent that SOFR is in excess of the 0.00% floor rate of our New Term Loan Facility), each one-eighth point change
in interest rates would result in a $0.5 million change in annual interest expense on our newly issued debt. Capitalized financing costs and
any original issue discount will be amortized over the life of the related debt. A summary of the effects of the adjustments on interest expense

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION**
**AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

For a description of Cvent’s management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of
operations with respect to its historical financial results, see Cvent’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2022 and Cvent’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, each as filed
with the SEC and incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum. See “Incorporation of certain information
by reference.” The following describes certain anticipated changes to Cvent’s financial condition and results of
operations as a result of the Transactions.

**Comparability of Historical Financial Results**

On March 14, 2023, the Issuer entered into the Merger Agreement with Cvent and Merger Sub. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the Merger, Merger
Sub will be merged with and into Cvent, with Cvent surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer.

The aggregate acquisition consideration (including the repayment of existing indebtedness) to be paid in
connection with the Merger will be approximately $4,373 million, based on a $8.50 price per share.

In connection with the consummation of the Merger, we intend to enter the following financing transactions:

    - the borrowing of $400 million under the New Term Loan Facility and the entry into the New Revolving
Credit Facility;

    - the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of secured notes offered hereby;

    - the issuance of $1,250 million aggregate initial liquidation preference of shares of preferred equity by
Topco to affiliates of Vista; and

    - the contribution of approximately $2,600 million of common equity by the Sponsors.

As a result of the Transactions discussed above, the historical consolidated financial statements incorporated
by reference into this offering memorandum are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations, financial
position and cash flows. For example, we expect to incur higher amortization expense and interest expense as a result
of the Transactions.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Prior to the Transactions, our primary sources of liquidity have been our cash and cash equivalents,
borrowings under the Existing Credit Facility and our cash flows from operations. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash
and cash equivalents of $102.2 million. After giving effect to the Transactions on a pro forma basis, we would have
had our cash and cash equivalents of $212.9 million and our New Revolving Credit Facility will also provide us with
additional liquidity as discussed under “—Borrowings—Post-Transactions” below.

Our primary uses of cash include product purchases, operating costs, personnel-related costs, capital
expenditures related to property and equipment and potential acquisitions. Going forward, we will also need to use a
portion of our cash for payments of interest under the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions as
discussed under “—Borrowings—Post-Transactions” below.

We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowing availability
under our New Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing working capital, investing and
financing requirements for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
operations is, however, subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions,
demand for our products and services, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks and uncertainties applicable to
our business, as described under “Risk Factors.”


-----

**_Borrowings – Historical_**

As of March 31, 2023, we had $138.0 million of total debt outstanding, including $362.0 million of
availability under the Existing Credit Facility.

We will repay all amounts outstanding under and terminate the agreement governing our Existing Credit
Facility in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

**_Borrowings – Post-Transactions_**

After the consummation of the Transactions, we will be highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2023, after giving
effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $900.0 million of total debt outstanding, including
$500.0 million of notes offered hereby, and $400.0 million of New Term Loan Facility, with approximately $115.0
million of availability under our New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, we will have the right at any time, subject
to customary conditions, to request incremental term loans or incremental revolving credit commitments in an
aggregate principal amount of up to (a) the greater of (1) $220.0 million and (2) an amount equal to 100% of our
consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which financial
statements are internally available, on a pro forma basis, plus (b) certain additional amounts subject to certain
conditions. See “Description of Other Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.”

Our liquidity requirements will increase after the consummation of the Transactions, primarily due to debt
service requirements. On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, our net cash interest expense for
the last twelve months ended March 31, 2023 would have been $81.9 million, using assumed blended interest rates
on our new indebtedness. Each 0.25% increase or decrease in such assumed blended interest rate would have increased
or decreased, as applicable, our pro forma interest expense by $2.25 million. The amount of borrowings under the
New Revolving Credit Facility will fluctuate from time to time and could increase the amount of outstanding
borrowings at any given time.

As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Sponsors and their affiliates and
members of management, may from time to time, depending upon market conditions, seek to repurchase debt
securities that we have issued or loans that we have borrowed, including the notes offered hereby and borrowings
under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer
or otherwise, and such repurchases may be at prices below par.

**BUSINESS**

**Mission**

Our mission is to transform the meetings and events industry through technology that delivers engagement
across virtual, in-person and hybrid events.

**Business Overview**

Cvent is the leading cloud-based software platform of event marketing and management and hospitality
solutions. We support the marketing and management of meetings and events through our Event Cloud and Hospitality
Cloud solutions. Our Event Cloud consists of software solutions and tools to enable event organizers to manage the
entire event lifecycle and deliver engaging experiences across every type of event and all event formats: in-person,
virtual and hybrid. Event Cloud serves as the system of record for event and engagement data collected across an
organization’s total event program, which comprises every internal and external event an organization hosts or attends
(“Total Event Program”). Our Hospitality Cloud includes Cvent Supplier Network (“CSN”), a marketplace that
connects event organizers looking for the appropriate event space for their in-person and hybrid events with hoteliers
and venue operators through a vertical search engine built on our proprietary database of detailed event space
information. In addition, our Hospitality Cloud provides software solutions that hotels and venues leverage to digitally
showcase their event space to attract valuable leads and grow their business, as well as tools that help our customers
manage group room blocks. This combination of our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud results in an integrated
solution that is mutually reinforcing.

Meetings and events are prevalent in organizations of almost every size, industry vertical and geography.
The meetings and events space encompasses a broad spectrum of external marketing events, such as customer events,
conferences, trade shows and prospect meetings; and internal events, such as sales kick-offs, training seminars, board
meetings, team-building activities and companywide gatherings. Collectively, organizations spent approximately $1
trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018, according to the Events Industry Council. According to a 2021 Frost
& Sullivan study we commissioned, the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our platform is $29.7 billion, across
our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions.

Meetings and events are regarded as some of the most effective ways to build engagement and drive outcomes
with customers, employees and members. External events, whether conducted in-person or virtually, are critical to
sales and marketing efforts, as they represent opportunities for organizations to directly engage with their most
important external audiences. Events offer a highly effective way for organizations to maximize engagement


-----

throughout the customer journey, helping them to generate and qualify leads, deepen relationships with customers and
build brand loyalty and advocacy. In addition, internal events aid in employee retention and development, as they
offer critical opportunities for human resources, training professionals and executive leadership to inspire and motivate
their employees through engaging experiences.

In 2020, the meetings and events industry was transformed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which forced
events into virtual environments and accelerated the ongoing digital transformation of the events industry. For virtual
events, the event technology is the event venue, video is the primary method of content delivery and virtual attendees
create a digital footprint of all of their event engagement that can be captured, analyzed and leveraged to both deliver
better event experiences and inform subsequent sales and marketing efforts. Even as the pandemic has subsided, we
believe virtual events will continue to remain prominent due to their ability to attract and engage vast audiences across
the globe.

However, we believe the fundamental and innate desire to meet in-person will mean that organizations’ Total
Event Programs will be primarily characterized by in-person events, complemented by virtual events and hybrid events
that offer the benefits of both. The hybrid event model enables organizations to harness the advantages of both inperson and virtual meetings at the same time by reaching both a broader audience and achieving greater levels of
engagement across far more attendees, thereby unlocking the potential for maximum return on their events investment.

The ability to host events today across in-person, virtual and hybrid formats offers significant flexibility to
event planners and attendees and allows organizations to host more events with more registrants than ever before.
Organizations are also increasingly expanding their event technology spend given the increased complexity of their
Total Event Program. For event professionals, planning, marketing and executing an event is a highly complex
endeavor that can become inefficient and time-consuming when managed using traditional manual processes,
homegrown solutions or disparate point software solutions. This complexity is further exacerbated by the proliferation
of hybrid events, which essentially require planners to simultaneously execute two events that are consistent across
distinct event formats. With events throughout the customer journey now being held across various event types and
multiple event formats, organizations increasingly desire a single system of record—one platform—to collect and
analyze these interrelated account and attendee engagement data points and act on this data, as well as manage the
associated meetings spend, enabling them to measure the impact of, and return on, their events investment.

**_Event Cloud_**

We address the challenges faced by event organizers today through our end-to-end Event Cloud platform
featuring solutions to drive engagement and manage all event types and processes within an organization’s Total Event
Program. Prior to an event, event organizers use our platform to identify the appropriate venue via CSN, our
Hospitality Cloud product sold into hotels and venues; secure competitive proposals; diagram venue space to optimize
the event layout; secure speakers; build an event website; market the event; conduct pre-event surveys; coordinate
event logistics and produce broadcast-quality video content; automate expense approvals; and manage budgeting and
costs through integrations with other enterprise systems.

During the course of an event, our platform enables event marketers and planners to process registrations,
check-in attendees, conduct sessions, broadcast sessions, facilitate networking appointments, capture leads and
manage on-going communication with attendees via an event-specific mobile app. Following an event, exhibitors and
sponsors can act on leads collected and scored via our platform and provide registrants with access to on-demand
video content, while event organizers can leverage our platform to analyze registration, attendance, session data and
survey responses to measure engagement, content effectiveness and overall event success.

Our platform leverages specific engagement actions within our Event Cloud solution to generate an
engagement score for each attendee. When this data is integrated with an organization’s customer relationship
management (“CRM”) and marketing automation systems, it can boost existing lead scores and inform the optimal
next action such as sales follow up and marketing nurture campaigns. Cross-event analysis also enables organizations
to measure the effectiveness of the entirety of their Total Event Program. The ability of Event Cloud to provide
organizations with insights into buyer interests across the customer journey across all events has made the event
program even more strategic and has positioned our platform as a critical component of an organization’s marketing
technology stack.


-----

Group business is a critical component of revenue and income for the hospitality industry. According to a
hotel industry data provider, group business can account for approximately one-third of hotel room nights; events also
have a high attach rate of ancillary revenue, including food and beverage, A/V and other equipment rental and
transportation services. We believe that as the hospitality industry continues to recover from the significant impact of
the pandemic, hoteliers and venues are actively seeking to drive group meeting business and are turning to digital
marketing tools and supporting software solutions, to market, sell and manage their event space, services and sleeping
rooms.

**_Hospitality Cloud_**

Our CSN solution is a vertical online marketplace that allows event organizers to seamlessly solicit, receive
and manage multiple RFPs for event space (by connecting them directly to hotels and venues at no charge to the
organizers). Our platform helps hotels find event organizers and win group business by enabling them to digitally
showcase their event space and automate the RFP process, while also providing event organizers the tools needed to
search, diligence, negotiate and contract with hotels for event space. CSN connects approximately 109,000 meeting
and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our proprietary global database as of December
31, 2022. We believe the breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and extensiveness of its proprietary
database makes CSN a highly differentiated platform and well positioned in the industry. We believe that CSN
contains one of the world’s most extensive and accurate repositories of detailed meeting venue information,
empowering event organizers to search for, and qualify, potential event sites. We also believe that our marketplace
generates network effects that simultaneously increase the volume of requests for proposal (“RFPs”) submitted from
event organizers and increase the number of hospitality professionals using our system to respond to RFPs.

Our Hospitality Cloud also offers software solutions to hotels and venues that improve the group sales process
and streamline collaboration between hoteliers and event organizers to design, manage and execute events. Our
software solutions include, but are not limited to, lead scoring to prioritize group RFPs received via CSN, event
diagramming to collaborate with event organizers on designing optimal and safe event layouts and viewing threedimensional renderings, room block management that allows hotels and planners to work in concert to efficiently
manage guest room reservations and room blocks for events and enables event attendees to reserve hotel rooms,
business transient solutions that simplify how hotels attract, manage and win corporate travel business and business
intelligence solutions to benchmark against internal and targeted competitive metrics.

We sell our platform primarily through a direct inside sales team. For our Event Cloud, our customers enter
annual and multi-year subscriptions to utilize our cloud-based event marketing and management solutions. The
amount of these sum-certain contracts is contractually committed upfront based on the expected aggregate number of
registrants for all events across an organization’s Total Event Program in a given year. As of December 31, 2022, we
had approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers. For our Hospitality Cloud, hotels and venues enter into annual and
multi-year contracts for group business marketing solutions and software. As of December 31, 2022, we had
approximately 11,000 Hospitality Cloud customers.

We employ a land-and-expand business model, where customers grow their spend with us over time. As our
Event Cloud customers grow their Total Event Program by launching new types of events, running more events and
attracting additional registrants to their events, their contracts are typically renewed at higher annual values.
Additionally, customers purchasing our platform to replace certain homegrown or multiple disparate point solutions
may initially purchase only one or a few of our solutions. As those customers recognize the value of an integrated
platform, they typically expand their footprint over time. As of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December
31, 2021, our net dollar retention rate was 115.1%, 113.9% and 101.0%, respectively. The increase in our net dollar
retention rate between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2023 is primarily due to the lessening impact of the global
COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and 2023 on both the Event and Hospitality Clouds, resulting in increased spend on
products supporting in-person events, in addition to the continued adoption of Attendee Hub, our solution for ongoing
attendee engagement and hybrid and virtual events.


-----

Our resilient business model has yielded strong results across all economic cycles and market conditions. For
the year ended December 31, 2020, during which the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a near-total pause on in-person
events, and a shift to virtual formats, our revenue decreased only 12% due to our sum-certain pricing model and multiyear contracts, despite not having a product catering to virtual formats at the start of the pandemic. As the meetings
and events industry continues its strong recovery from the pandemic, we have leveraged our comprehensive platform
to extend our industry leading position and delivered strong financial results. For the twelve-month period ending
March 31, 2023, the Company generated $659.4 million in revenue, representing 22.4% year-over-year growth, a Pro
Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA Margin of 33.6% and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures
Conversion of 73.0%. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial
Information— Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.”

**Industry Trends**

_Event Cloud_

**_Increased Importance of Meetings and Events to Chief Marketing and Chief Revenue Officers. Meetings_**
and events offer opportunities for organizations to engage directly with their customers for extended periods of time,
and as a result, can represent some of the most effective and highest value touchpoints along the entire customer
journey. The emergence of virtual and hybrid formats has enabled organizations to both reach a broader audience in
a cost-effective manner and achieve greater levels of engagement across far more attendees, thereby realizing greater
return on their events investment. Marquee events such as user conferences and tradeshows present organizations with
significant marketing and sales opportunities, providing a forum to engage with hundreds or thousands of their
prospects, customers and partners in attendance. As a result, meetings and events can represent one of the enterprise’s
most influential marketing channels. According to a 2021 Forrester study we commissioned, 74% of respondents
considered events to be their most important demand generation tactic.

Due to their importance to the customer journey, meetings and events can be a significant component of the
marketing efforts for any organization. Forrester also estimates that events in total comprise approximately 24% of
the average organization’s B2B marketing program budget. Given the significance of the associated spend, the ability
of events to generate engagement to showcase buyer interests, and event’s expected direct impact on sales pipeline,
we believe that chief marketing officers and other C-suite executives have a heightened interest in their success and
effectiveness.

**_Increased Importance of Internal Meetings and Events to Engage Employees. In a world characterized by_**
increasingly distributed workforces, organizations are likely to rely more than ever on events, whether in-person,


-----

virtual or hybrid, to engage and retain employees who now often have fewer daily in-person interactions. With the
option to host virtual and hybrid events, we believe employers will host events more frequently to enhance employee
engagement, facilitate networking opportunities, help establish and maintain company culture, attract and recruit new
employees, offer immersive opportunities for career development and lower attrition. As organizations look to provide
differentiated workplace experiences to attract and retain top talent, we believe internal events will become even more
important to HR and other C-suite executives.

**_Fundamental Shift in Event Environments. Prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the meetings and_**
events industry was principally dominated by in-person events. Following the success of the virtual events held
throughout the pandemic, we believe many in-person events will over time become hybrid events that prominently
feature virtual components to enable event organizers to maximize audience reach and engagement. We also believe
that the increased value proposition and reach of a larger Total Event Program will drive event organizers to host more
events, attracting more attendees, and thus increasing their total event technology spend.

**_Accelerated Adoption of Event Technology to Automate Highly Complex Planning Process. Organizing_**
and executing a meeting, event, or conference is a highly complex process. While many organizations have embraced
digital transformation across functional areas by investing in software to automate workflows, streamline business
processes and enable data collection and analysis, they have less frequently prioritized making similar investments to
modernize their event management processes. In the new event environment, the need to effectively manage a
combination of in-person, virtual and hybrid events, has driven greater complexity across an organization’s Total
Event Program. While hybrid events offer significant flexibility to attendees, they add complexity to the organizer, as
they require that the organizers deliver two different, but still consistent, experiences for a single event for all segments
of that event. We believe that this increased complexity and the increased importance of meetings and events have
resulted in an inflection point, and the digital transformation of the event management space has accelerated.

While many enterprises have embraced digital transformation by investing in enterprise software to automate
workflows, streamline business processes and enable data collection and analysis for several departments, including
finance, sales, marketing, expense management and human resources, organizations have generally not made similar
investments in event technology to manage and automate the activities of event organizers and their Total Event
Program.

The need to effectively manage a combination of in-person, virtual and hybrid events, has resulted in new
complexities in managing a Total Event Program. While hybrid events offer significant flexibility to attendees, they
add complexity to the organizer, as they require that organizers deliver two different, but still consistent, experiences
for a single event for all segments of that event. We believe that this increased complexity has resulted in an inflection
point that has accelerated the digital transformation of the event management space.

Some event organizers have attempted to address these challenges with external point solutions or internally
developed tools that we believe do not give them direct control over the attendee experience, are not built to deliver
engaging experiences and do not provide access to real-time, actionable data. Moreover, these tools and point solutions
do not address the entire event lifecycle or the full range of event delivery models. As a result, these organizations
may struggle to effectively plan, manage, measure and improve their events, which may reduce or eliminate the
associated sales and marketing benefits. We believe these challenges will lead organizations to embrace and expand
their use of event technology to harness the full potential of their Total Event Program.

**_Growing Challenge of Managing Events Data to Unlock Actionable Insights Across a Total Event_**
**_Program. With the emergence of, and continued demand for, virtual and hybrid events, event organizers must now_**
manage a Total Event Program consisting of multiple events across all event formats. Over the course of a customer’s
journey from initial awareness to closing of a sale, an enterprise may interact with that customer through an in-person
industry trade show, a virtual webinar, an in-person seminar, a hybrid roadshow, an in-person prospect development
event, a hybrid user conference and a virtual customer event, among other interactions. For any given event, interaction
and engagement data helps to provide a more accurate view into that customer’s interests and intent.

When combined across all the events in a Total Event Program, this engagement data can deliver actionable
insights into the optimal action in that customer’s journey, helping organizations identify leads and advance sales
opportunities. Some event organizers may attempt to manage their Total Event Program and attendee data with an


-----

array of disparate point solutions designed for a specific event delivery model, like virtual only or in-person only, or
designed only for a specific portion of the event lifecycle, such as registration, a mobile app or onsite check-in.
However, these point solutions leave attendee engagement data isolated in silos and typically lack the functionality
for executing events across event formats, as well as the integration and data sharing capabilities to create a single
system of record for the Total Event Program. We believe the inability to put together a full and clear picture of interest
will lead organizations to use one event technology platform that can show prospect and customer intent across the
Total Event Program.

**_Greater Range of Channels to Engage with Attendees Throughout the Event Lifecycle. Communication_**
with attendees throughout the event lifecycle is critical and event organizers utilize a wide variety of mediums to reach
their intended audience, including email, online marketing, text messaging, virtual chat messaging, social media
platforms and video content. Event organizers also engage with attendees through mobile event apps and, for virtual
events, through the virtual event venue. Event organizers leverage these channels to market their event prior to its
start, increase engagement through gamification, share event-related information in real-time, establish interactive
online attendee networks and communities during the event and connect with attendees following the event to continue
attendee engagement and solicit valuable feedback essential to future event planning and sales follow-up. However,
we believe many event organizers struggle to maintain consistent messaging and branding across the numerous
channels through which they are interacting with attendees. Marketers and planners require a comprehensive crosschannel platform to help them interact with attendees throughout the event lifecycle across the customer’s entire
journey in one consistent voice.

**_Need for Greater Visibility into Meeting and Event Spend and Return on Investment. Organizations have_**
increasingly adopted software platforms to provide visibility into spend in various functional areas. However, they
have historically lacked a solution to centrally monitor and manage their meetings and events spend. As meetings and
events budgets have grown, enterprises organizations are adopting event marketing and management software to help
them assess their aggregate spend, make the event process more efficient and leverage spend data in vendor
negotiations. With an accurate picture of spend, organizations are able to more accurately calculate the return on their
meetings and events investments.

As meetings and events budgets have grown, enterprises are adopting event marketing and management
software to help them assess their aggregate spend, make the event process more efficient and leverage spend data in
vendor negotiations. With an accurate picture of spend, event organizers are able to calculate the return on their
meetings and events investments. This analysis can in turn be used to justify additional events spend, particularly as
event organizers seek to expand their Total Event Program with hybrid and virtual events. Event spend management
can also ensure that events are designed, organized and managed to meet targeted objectives. For example, certain
event organizers in more regulated environments, such as pharmaceutical sales, face comprehensive regulatory
requirements, like reporting on spend per heath care professional, which are not easily manageable with manual
processes.

**_Increased Need for Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations. The changing regulatory environment_**
related to personal data protection is complex. Globally, numerous jurisdictions have passed or are actively
considering passing new or amended privacy laws. As a result, privacy laws are increasing in number, driving more
complexity and with increased enforcement of these new laws, the number of fines and other penalties has also
increased. The heightened security of the regulatory environment is driving even greater focus on compliance needs
and data privacy requirements. As customers seek ways to manage compliance and data privacy, they are searching
for a unified technology solution that can efficiently track and monitor their requirements.

_Hospitality Cloud_

**_Increased Hospitality Demand from Group Business. In normal operating environments, hotels generate_**
revenue from three primary types of business: leisure travel, business travel and event and group business. In addition
to generating revenue for hotels from accommodations, events have a high attach rate of ancillary hotel services, such
as, food and beverage, event space, audiovisual support, equipment rental, and transportation. Event attendees are also
typically hotel guests that utilize the hotel’s restaurants, shops, spas and other paid amenities. As these additional
services generate substantial incremental revenue and profit, hotels and venues can improve their profitability by
increasing the utilization rate of their event space. Given the highly profitable nature of events and group meetings, as


-----

well as the revenue certainty and predictability they provide to hotels, competition to attract and win this business is
increasingly fierce among hotels and venues. With in-person events returning as the pandemic recedes, hotels are
looking to capitalize on this increase in demand by attracting event organizers to their properties. As a result, we
expect hotel operators to increase spend on efficiently driving group business.

**_Underinvestment in Group Meetings Business. Event organizers can be found across a broad range of_**
departments, including marketing, sales, travel, human resources, training and development and operations, and have
a wide variety of titles. Due to the decentralized and periodic nature of event planning within organizations, hotel
operators often find it challenging to qualify high-value leads and effectively market to the professionals responsible
for planning meetings and events.

As a result of this challenge and the high levels of associated manual effort, hotels generally underinvest in
selling and marketing group meetings. We believe that hotels and venues that leverage purpose-built, scalable
technology solutions, such as ours, are better positioned to generate more revenue and increase their return on
marketing spend. Without an effective way to conduct outbound marketing, hotels must rely on less targeted marketing
tactics or on inbound leads to solicit interest and generate events and group meetings business. We believe that hotels
and venues that leverage scalable technology solutions, such as ours, that are built for their target audience are better
positioned to attract more business and increase their return on marketing spend.

**_Industry-wide Hotel Staffing Shortages. Hotel operators have experienced persistent staffing challenges_**
since the COVID-19 pandemic began. According to a January 2023 American Hotel & Lodging Association report,
79% of U.S. hotels are experiencing staffing shortages, with 22% severely under-staffed in a way that was affecting
operations. These staffing shortages result in increased demands on staff and reduced satisfaction levels for customers.
Software productivity solutions that allow hotel employees to automate manual workflows and centrally manage
customer demands are increasingly important for hotel operators.

**_Need to Digitize and Automate Highly Manual RFP and Group Business Processes._** In searching for a
venue, event organizers often submit inquiries and bids to hotels in a variety of formats, including email, phone call
and PDF, Word or Excel files. In responding to these requests, many hoteliers and venue operators often rely on
generic business tools, such as word processing applications and spreadsheets, to respond to these requests. The nonstandard process of both submitting requests and responding to requests results in increased time and cost associated
with an RFP for both parties. In managing confirmed group meetings business, hoteliers and event organizers also
typically leverage these generic tools to gather guest data, book rooms and organize room reservations. In our
experience, these tools increase the time and cost burden of the process, often increase the chance of data entry error
and could heighten the risk of data privacy issues. As hotels look to streamline efforts and ensure compliance,
additional technology solutions will be required.

**_Need to Showcase Meeting and Event Space Virtually. Traditionally, hoteliers and venue operators have_**
showcased their properties to event organizers with in-person site visits. However, even before the pandemic, hoteliers
had begun to utilize virtual tools to showcase their properties to reduce spend and streamline the event planning
process. Macroeconomic pressures, sustainability efforts, and an increasingly digitally native planner base have further
accelerated the trend of online and virtual sourcing, to the extent that many event organizers now expect online site
tours, interactive floorplans and event diagrams to be standard offerings.

**_Need for Group Meetings Business Intelligence to Compete More Effectively. In order to uncover new areas_**
of opportunity and generate leads, hotels and venue operators need to leverage data to evaluate their performance in
this segment. Business intelligence can provide insights into RFP trends, response activities, win ratios, pace against
expected demand, and other key performance metrics. Business intelligence also enables hotels and venue operators
to evaluate their group performance relative to their competition and to identify opportunities for improvement.

**Industry Opportunity**

According to a 2021 Frost & Sullivan study we commissioned, the TAM for our platform is $29.7 billion,
across our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions.


-----

**_Cvent Event Cloud. According to a 2021 Frost & Sullivan study we commissioned, the annual TAM for the_**
Event Cloud is $25.6 billion worldwide. The TAM for Event Cloud was calculated by first estimating the total number
of organizations that our platform and products address, segmented by size of employee base and organization type,
including corporate and non-corporate, based on the 2017 Statistics of U.S. Businesses and 2020 U.S. Census Data.
Addressability assumptions were then applied by segment and band based on our experience in the industry. An
estimated annual value was then applied to each band of organizations based on survey responses related to spend on
event technology. The total number of organizations within each band was then multiplied by the calculated annual
value for that band. The aggregate calculated value represents the current annual estimated market opportunity of
$14.1 billion and $11.5 billion in the United States and Rest of World, respectively. We believe a significant portion
of our TAM for Event Cloud is underpenetrated, including organizations which use traditional, manual processes or
point solutions to manage events, many of which we believe will adopt event management software solutions going
forward.

**_Cvent Hospitality Cloud. According to a 2021 Frost & Sullivan study we commissioned, the annual TAM_**
for the Hospitality Cloud is $4.1 billion. The TAM for Hospitality Cloud was calculated by first estimating the total
number of hotels with meeting space, segmented by geography, tier, and banded by total square footage of meeting
space. Addressability assumptions were then applied by segment and product based on our experience in the industry.
An estimated annual spend was then applied to each band of hotels and venues based on survey responses related to
spend on group marketing in digital channels. The total number of hotels and venues within each band was then
multiplied by the calculated annual value for that band. The aggregate calculated value represents the current global
annual estimated market opportunity of $4.1 billion.

**Key Credit Strengths**

**_Addressing Large and Growing, Yet Underpenetrated Opportunity Experiencing Rapid Digitalization._**
Meetings and events represent one of the most effective ways for organizations to engage, educate and motivate their
target audiences. This value proposition is why meetings and events are often regarded as some of the most effective
and best funded marketing strategies. According to the Events Industry Council, in aggregate organizations spent
approximately $1 trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018. According to a 2021 Forrester study we
commissioned, 74% of respondents considered events to be their most important demand generation tactic. Forrester
also estimates that events in total comprise approximately 24% of the average organization’s business-to-business
marketing program budget.

The rapid evolution of the event environment, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly
expanded our market opportunity and accelerated the digital transformation of the underpenetrated event management
software industry. In this new landscape, organizations can reach larger audiences through multiple event formats,
engage with greater frequency given reduced hosting costs associated with virtual events and deliver differentiated
experiences with enhanced technology offerings that manage the full lifecycle of events across the Total Event
Program. As a result, we believe organizations will host more events with more registrants and will also expand their
event technology spend per event. In order to navigate the increased scale and complexity of the new event
environment, we believe organizations relying on point solutions or internally developed tools will invest in purposebuilt system of record platforms to automate workflows, enable data collection and facilitate the hosting of events
across multiple environments. Also, the global shift to a more distributed workforce is causing organizations to gather
in large groups more regularly, further increasing demand for events. As the market leader, Cvent is well-positioned
to benefit from these trends to capture share and further penetrate its $29.7 billion TAM.

We believe the meetings and events industry is presently benefiting from multiple tailwinds that could
facilitate its continued robust recovery from the pandemic. Third-party reports, from the Knowland Group and a major
industry consultant, respectively, show that the global volume of event attendees during 2022 was 1.5 billion,
approximately 12% below the 2019 level of 1.7 billion prior to the pandemic. In the near-term, we expect event
attendance volumes to continue to recover to pre-pandemic levels, driven by the growth of in-person events. A
Northstar survey we commissioned found that 67% of event planners expect more events in 2023 compared to 2022
and 70% of event planners expect increases in event budgets in 2023 compared to 2022. Longer term, we believe that
event attendee volumes will exceed pre-pandemic levels, due to the increased importance of meetings and events to
both marketing and internal use cases as well as the ability to host across multiple formats.


-----

**_A Clear Leader with Comprehensive, Differentiated Solutions with Network Effects. Our position in the_**
industry is highly favorable. We offer a comprehensive cloud-based platform of mission-critical event marketing and
management solutions for event planners and marketers and hospitality marketing and software solutions for hoteliers.
In connecting both sides of the event landscape, we generate network effects, whereby the value derived by each side
is strengthened by its integration with the other side, all facilitated by our platform.

In the new event landscape, we expect organizations will require a single platform capable of both driving
engagement and managing all of their events. As organizations’ Total Event Programs have rapidly shifted to events
across multiple event formats, point solutions are unable to meet the needs of customers. Our Event Cloud offers event
planners a platform to manage every type of event and all event formats: in-person, virtual and hybrid. As many
incumbent vendors, including Cvent, did not have capabilities for virtual events at the onset of the pandemic,
customers were forced to purchase from point solution vendors when rapidly pivoting to virtual events. We believe
that in order to manage Total Event Programs across in-person, virtual and hybrid events, many of these organizations
will migrate to end-to-end platforms. According to a major industry consultant survey commissioned by the Sponsor,
of the 46% of organizations using different event management solutions for in-person and virtual events,
approximately 35% are likely to consolidate spend onto a single, end-to-end platform in the near-term. As the industry
leader offering a comprehensive platform, we believe Cvent is well-positioned to benefit from this shift.

As organizations’ Total Event Programs deliver multiple high-impact touchpoints across the customer
journey, marketers require a solution to capture and analyze attendee registration and engagement data across multiple
events and all event formats. Our Event Cloud enables event organizers to collect and aggregate a significant amount
of data from before, during and after events, creating a single system of record for all event data. Our platform enables
organizations to combine and analyze event data with data from their CRM and marketing automation systems to
deliver actionable intelligence on customer purchasing intent and next-best actions. The ability to provide value-added
insights into the customer journey has made Event Cloud a mission-critical component of an organization’s marketing
technology stack, increasing the adoption and retention of our platform.

With the rapid return of in-person events amidst industry-wide labor shortages, hotels are increasingly
focused on leveraging technology to efficiently expand their group business volumes. Our Hospitality Cloud enables
hotels to virtually showcase and market their event space to event planners, source and respond to RFPs and automate
the workflows associated with managing group business. The ability to streamline the process for sourcing, winning
and managing business for this highly strategic revenue stream makes our platform integral to the operations of
hospitality providers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, planners sourced approximately $14.0 billion in RFP
value via our platform, illustrating the extent to which Cvent is embedded in the hospitality industry.


-----

Cvent brings together both sides of the event ecosystem via CSN, which connects approximately 109,000
meeting and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our extensive proprietary global
database as of December 31, 2022. As a result of its breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and
extensiveness of its proprietary database, we believe CSN is highly differentiated. We also believe that these factors
enable our marketplace to generate network effects that continually attract event planners and hospitality providers to
our platform.

**_Recession-Resilient and Steady Revenue Model Underpinned by Sum-Certain Contracts. Cvent operates_**
a resilient business model, generating revenue from Event Cloud subscription-based solutions and Hospitality Cloud
marketing-based and subscription-based solutions. The Company’s subscription-based revenue model and strong
emphasis on selling multi-year contracts results in visible, predictable and durable revenue. For the year ended
December 31, 2022, recurring revenue represented 93% of total revenue and approximately 50% of the annual
contractual dollar value of bookings was associated with multi-year subscription contracts.

Central to this resilient business model is the Company’s contracting and pricing structure. Event Cloud
contract amounts are sum-certain based on the committed annual minimum number of registrants and events, rather
than on a purely per-event or per-registrant basis. Generally, if a customer exceeds the number of purchased
registrations, the customer will incur an overage fee for registrations that exceeded the number of registrations
purchased. Hospitality Cloud marketing revenue is generated based on the number of marketing solutions purchased,
rather than on a pay-per-click or impression basis, and software solutions are priced primarily on the number of
licenses purchased. We believe that CSN is a differentiated solution that plays an important role in the sales and
marketing strategy of hospitality providers by enabling them to cost-effectively generate leads, win group business
and drive revenue growth. The terms of our subscription and marketing contracts for both Event Cloud and Hospitality
Cloud are typically non-cancellable, are for annual or multi-year terms and are billed in advance on an annual or
quarterly basis.

Cvent’s recession-resilient model, combined with its experienced, long-tenured management team and strong
culture of innovation, has enabled the Company to deliver strong financial performance through multiple market
cycles, including the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company
demonstrated the strength of its business model during the pandemic when, despite a near-total pause on in-person
events, revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 declined only 12%, and the Company returned to revenue
growth of 4% and 22% in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. For the quarter ended March
31, 2023, we experienced revenue growth of 21% compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by organizations
continuing to invest in meetings and events technology today.

**_Strong, Diversified, Blue-Chip Customer Base with Robust Customer Unit Economics. We have a large,_**
diversified customer base with approximately 11,000 customers using Event Cloud and approximately 11,000
customers using Hospitality Cloud. Cvent’s customers include large, multinational blue-chip enterprises such as CocaCola, Mastercard, Zoom and many of the world’s largest hospitality providers, including MGM Resorts and Marriott.
Our customers are spread across diverse industries and sectors including companies from hospitality, healthcare,
financial services, technology, education, and industrials, among others, as well as trade associations and non-profits.
As it relates to hotels, the vast majority of purchasing occurs at the property level, rather than at the corporate brand
level. As a result, the Company has limited revenue concentration, with the largest customer accounting for less than
1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Cvent’s customer base exhibits attractive unit economics, with high levels of retention and expansion across
the platform. Cvent maintains a loyal customer base, having cultivated many of its customer relationships for over a
decade through a strong emphasis on customer success. We have a strong track record of facilitating upsells and crosssells. As of March 31, 2023, our net dollar retention rate was 115.1%. The expansion of our existing customer base
provides exceptional top-line visibility and results in greater profitability given the less costly nature of selling into
existing clients versus new ones.

Our ability to increase customers’ usage of the platform over time results in higher value customer
relationships and represents a significant opportunity to drive sustainable revenue growth. As of December 31, 2022,
55.8% of our Event Cloud customers have subscriptions to more than one of our solutions, representing an increase


-----

from 41.4 % as of December 31, 2019. We believe there is a significant opportunity to cross-sell additional solutions
within our existing customer base of approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers as of December 31, 2022.

The significant value of our platform and our continued expansion within existing customers results in large
scale, high-retention customer contracts, as evidenced by the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000
of ARR. Revenue from these customers represented 43.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase from
32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. We had 935 of such customers as of December 31, 2022, an increase
from 722 of such customers on December 31, 2019, demonstrating our ability to attract and meet the needs of large
organizations. Historically, we have retained our customers with higher average contract values at a rate higher than
our average rate, as evidenced by a net dollar retention rate of 124.4% and a lost-only churn rate below 1% as of
March 31, 2023 for customers that contribute more than $100,000 of ARR. Our long customer tenure, consistent
customer expansion and strong customer base, including large enterprise customers, helps drive predictable and
durable revenue.

**_Attractive Financial Profile Complemented by Clear Path for Margin Expansion via Identified Cost_**
**_Savings and Operating Leverage. Cvent maintains an attractive financial profile, characterized by a combination of_**
long-term growth, strong profitability and consistent free cash flow generation. Cvent demonstrated strong resiliency
through the unprecedented disruption to the event ecosystem resulting from the pandemic, realizing a compound
annual revenue growth rate of 3.6% for the three-year period from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2022 when
the underlying events market declined significantly. The Company has accelerated growth following the pandemic,
generating $659.4 million in revenue for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023, representing 22.4% over
the prior year period.

In addition to its durable growth, Cvent maintains attractive unit economics, characterized by 73.3% NonGAAP Gross Margin for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, high levels of customer retention and an integrated
technology stack that enables cost-effective cross-sell and upsell. As a result, the Company has the ability to operate
at high margins: for example, in 2017, the Company generated 32.7% Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin. From 2017 to
2022, we experienced a decline in margins due to intentional investments to support long-term growth. We
consolidated ten products into four, including the migration of the Lanyon customer base, re-built our core event
management platform and quickly built and deployed a virtual solution at scale during COVID-19 to meet the rapidly
evolving needs of customers resulting from the disruption to in-person events. The increased level of investment
during this period was primarily focused on research and development but also temporarily constrained the efficiency
with which we were able to sell, serve and support our customers. As a result, for the twelve-month period ended
March 31, 2023, the Company generated $147.0 million of Adjusted Cash EBITDA, representing a 22.3% margin and
$87.3 million of Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, representing 59.3% Adjusted Cash EBITDA less
Capital Expenditures Conversion. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Financial Information— Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.”

We believe that the Company’s competitive position is stronger than ever and that we are now wellpositioned to benefit from these investments. In 2022, Cvent reached an inflection point as the events end market
stabilized which, coupled with its recent platform and product enhancements, enabled the Company to prioritize
operational improvements to better manage its cost structure, drive margin expansion and boost profitability going
forward. In particular, the Company began to right-size its level of investment in certain areas through headcount
optimization and vendor rationalization. Notably, headcount decreased 2.1% between November 30, 2022 and March
31, 2023 while revenue growth has continued to accelerate, as demonstrated by the 21% revenue growth for the quarter
ended March 31, 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022.


-----

As a result of the Sponsor’s diligence, several areas of opportunities for additional efficiency have been
identified that could accelerate realization of cost savings. According to a report from a third-party consultant
commissioned by the Sponsor, the aggregate cost savings opportunity is $74 million, with potential upside. We
believe that these savings, which are split between labor (approximately $58 million) and procurement (approximately
$16 million), are readily actionable and achievable. Labor initiatives include the continued automation of manual
processes as well as further offshoring of research and development personnel to our India office. Additionally, we
plan to right-size and simplify the organization, and selectively outsource non-core functions, especially within
services, customer support, and corporate IT. On the procurement side, cost savings will be largely driven by vendor
rationalization, top vendor negotiation, and office footprint consolidation. We expect a majority of savings will be
realized within 12 months and the full-run rate savings will be realized in 18 months. Fully implemented, these cost
saving measures could result in improved pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin of approximately 34%, which
are in line with our margin profile in 2017 on a revenue base that is approximately 63% larger as of March 31, 2023.

**_Highly Experienced, Founder-Led Management Team with Demonstrated Track Record of Execution._**
Cvent is led by a long-tenured management team with extensive expertise in the meetings and events space. Our
executive team is led by founder and CEO Reggie Aggarwal, who founded Cvent in 1999 and has held this role ever
since. Cvent’s current management team includes seven of the 11 members of the original leadership, who have led
the company through private equity ownership and two separate periods as a public company and have an average
tenure of approximately 12 years at Cvent. We believe our management team has the vision and expertise, as well as
the experience of navigating through multiple market cycles, to successfully execute on our strategy over the long
term.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the following strengths provide us with competitive differentiation relative to our
competitors:

**_One Platform to Manage Events and Drive Engagement Across the Total Event Program. Our platform_**
enables organizations to manage and execute internal and external events of all sizes, complexities and delivery
models. Our platform serves as a single system of record for the Total Event Program, enabling event organizers to
maximize, collect and take action on attendee registration and engagement data before, during and after events. This
centralized repository of data collected from attendee interactions across multiple events throughout the customer
journey delivers actionable intelligence on the interests and preferences of an organization’s customers and prospects.
We believe that our ability to offer an integrated platform that maximizes engagement across a full suite of event
marketing and management solutions for in-person, virtual and hybrid events is a competitive differentiator when
compared to competitors offering point solutions for specific processes or event delivery models.

**_Management of the Entire Event Lifecycle. We offer an integrated, end-to-end, cloud-based platform that_**
addresses the entire lifecycle of meetings and events of every type and format. Organizations using point solutions are
required to cobble together disparate products and data silos from across the event lifecycle to manage a single event.
Importing and exporting data into and out of multiple systems creates data integrity concerns, increases potential risk
as it relates to privacy laws and increases cost as it is highly labor-intensive. Our platform approach enables
organizations to streamline the workflow for managing all elements of an event, and results in a more fluid, branded,
secure and engaging experience for attendees.

**_Integrations with Other Critical Enterprise Systems. Our solution includes native integrations with leading_**
CRM and marketing automation platforms such as Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle Eloqua, HubSpot and Microsoft
Dynamics, and is also capable of connecting to any web-based program through APIs and webhooks. Our end-to-end
platform scores, consolidates and shares attendee engagement data through integrations with CRM and marketing
automation tools to help marketers enhance buyer profiles, obtain a clearer picture of attendee interest, and follow up
more quickly and accurately with attendees, bolstering sales pipelines and aiding in client retention. Our Salesforce
integration is differentiated from our competitors’ offerings in that it empowers sales teams to drive event attendance
by inviting or registering their customers and prospects directly from within Salesforce, mitigating the need for
marketing teams to interface with sales to coordinate invite lists, promotions, and discounts with sales teams.


-----

Our solution also integrates with Concur, Amex, and global distributions systems (GDS) like Sabre and
Amadeus, to provide visibility into expenses and streamline the approval process. Specifically, our Concur integration
provides visibility into typical meeting expenditures and provides insights regarding individual traveler costs.
Collectively, this helps automate the back-end reconciliation process for meetings, travel and expense data.
Additionally, Cvent integrates with web communication systems such as Zoom, Teams and Webex, to help customers
manage attendee registration and capture participation details. These technologies can also be combined with Cvent
solutions to deliver engaging and impactful hybrid events, such as Zoomtopia, which was powered by both Cvent
technologies and Zoom Events.

**_Relationships with Meeting and Event Planners. Unlike personnel in traditional, clearly defined_**
departments, planners can often be based within a wide range of corporate departments, such as marketing, sales,
travel, human resources, training and development and operations. Professionals ranging from marketing managers to
sales representatives to executive assistants are tasked with organizing and executing meetings and events. Given the
periodic nature of events, in many cases event planning falls outside of the scope of their day-to-day responsibilities
and these professionals dedicate only a portion of their time to event planning. Through our more than two decades
supporting the events industry, we have developed a substantial proprietary database of professionals who we believe
are involved in meeting and event planning activities within their organizations. Given our industry prominence and
the millions of events we have powered throughout our history, we have developed expertise on how to maximize
event success, and we create thought leadership content that we promote to our database of professionals and through
digital marketing. Each year, we engage with hundreds of thousands of industry professionals, allowing us to build
new relationships and continue to grow our prominence in the industry.

**_Large Seamless Online Venue Marketplace. We believe that CSN is a valuable, proprietary resource for_**
both components of the meetings and events ecosystem—marketers and event planners as well as hoteliers and venue
operators—due to its:

    - _Depth and Breadth of Venue Profiles. Our proprietary network includes detailed event space profile_
information on over 302,000 hotels and other venues as of December 31, 2022. CSN enables planners
to conduct searches and filter results based on over 200 characteristics and criteria per hotel profile. Once
an event space is identified, CSN enables planners to visit some venues virtually via three-dimensional
models. A portion of the underlying event data is submitted by the hotels and venues and a portion is
researched by our expert team, which has created an extensive data set with an exceptional level of detail
and granularity. Our team of customer-facing staff maintain relationships and work with the venues to
keep their information up to date and enhance the data richness of CSN. The size and accuracy of our
database is of critical importance to planners and sets CSN apart.

    - _Billions in RFP Value. During 2022, planners sourced approximately $14.0 billion in RFP value through_
our sourcing tools, including CSN. In interviews conducted by a third-party consultant on behalf of the
Sponsor, several Hospitality Cloud customers indicated that CSN is the largest source of RFP volume
for their group business. We believe that by offering a global marketplace to connect both sides of the
events ecosystem, CSN is a critical external lead generation channel for event and group meetings
business.

    - _Integration with Hotels. As of December 31, 2022, we are directly integrated with the back-end sales,_
catering and IT systems of more than 41,000 hotels, reducing manual data entry for hotel staff and
enabling a more efficient RFP response process. We believe this level of adoption and back-end IT
system integration from our hotel partners is further evidence of the value hoteliers and venues derive
from CSN.

    - _Network Effects Across the Events Ecosystem. By connecting both sides of the meetings and events_
ecosystem, CSN generates network effects. As more hoteliers and venue operators list and market their
properties on CSN, it becomes more valuable to the more than 109,000 event planners and marketers
sourcing venues for their events. Increased usage by event planners increases the volume of RFPs
delivered to hotels and venues, thereby increasing the value we deliver to hoteliers and venue operators
and causing more hotels and venues to list their properties on the network.


-----

    - _Efficiency for Planners. Planners use CSN, generally at no cost, to search for venues, request price quotes_
and proposals from hotels and venues and compare proposals to identify the venue that best meets the
specialized needs and requirements of their event. The vertical nature of CSN makes it a highly relevant
and effective tool for planners in identifying an appropriate venue. CSN also provides substantial time
savings benefits, as planners can quickly evaluate, generally at no cost, an extensive network of potential
hotels and venues and receive rapid responses from a selected shortlist.

    - _Lead Sourcing for Hoteliers and Venue Operators._ Hotel and venue operators list their event spaces on
CSN in order to receive and respond to event proposal requests from planners. Our ability to connect
hoteliers and venue operators with high-quality leads makes us an essential resource for hoteliers and
venue operators and has resulted in a significant volume of RFPs processed. In part due to the extensive
scope of our marketplace, many hotels have integrated CSN into their core back-end IT systems.

**_Recurring Revenue Model with Sum-Certain Contracts._** Our business model is highly recurring and
predictable with annual or multi-year subscriptions under sum-certain contracts. Our multi-year contracts deliver
strong revenue visibility and resilience, as evidenced by our performance through the COVID-19 pandemic. Contracts
for our Event Cloud solution range from one to five years in length. These contracts generally include subscription
fees for licensed modules, which are based on volume commitments aligned with the registrations and events
anticipated across the customer’s Total Event Program. Our Event Cloud contracts typically include overage fees for
usage beyond the specified registrant and event amounts. We also sell our Hospitality Cloud solutions to hoteliers and
venue operators through annual or multi-year contracts, which typically range from one to three years. These contracts
typically include subscription fees for our marketing placements and licensed software modules.

**_Investment in Product Innovation. We believe that we have an industry leading pace of innovation, deep_**
dedication to security, commitment to compliance and data privacy, and greater investment in next-gen technology
that will further strengthen our solutions. We have continuously invested in our business and technology, with
cumulative spend of approximately $846 million on research and development since 2017. With this investment, we
built an entirely new comprehensive platform in the cloud built for flexibility and scalability, which enable cost
optimization. The strength and breadth of experience of our over 1,000 employee research and development team
enabled us to respond rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing our virtual event solution in September 2020,
which we continued to improve and optimize through 2021 and 2022. As the in-person event format began rebounding
in the wake of the pandemic, we were, and remain, uniquely positioned to meet customer demand for all event types
including internal and external; formats including in-person, virtual, and hybrid; and sizes ranging from large to small.

**_Commitment to Compliance and Privacy Requirements. A compliance mindset underpins our technology_**
foundation. Our platform includes features and options designed to support compliance across governing bodies and
provides options and features to enable customers to make privacy and compliance choices that align with customer
needs and relevant legal requirements. Additionally, our platform has built-in solutions to facilitate compliance with
data subject requests. These solutions allow our customers to obtain and maintain required certifications.

**Our Strategy**

Key elements of our strategy include:

**_Expand Our Customer Base by Adding New Marketers, Planners, Hotels and Venues. We believe that_**
with the accelerated digital transformation of the events industry, organizations will host more events, with more
attendees, and will have a greater need for event technology. We expect organizations will require a single platform
capable of both driving engagement and managing all of their events, which will further increase the demand for our
solutions. We believe a significant portion of organizations that embraced virtual events during the pandemic have
seen the promise of event digitalization and will no longer rely on homegrown tools and manual processes to manage
events.

We also believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our penetration of the hotel and venue market.
With the return in-person events, group meetings business again represents a significant component of hotel revenue.
We believe that hoteliers seeking to grow their group meetings revenue will increasingly seek out technology solutions


-----

to market their venues and generate incremental business. With hoteliers and venue operators operating with reduced
workforces and managing through a tight and competitive labor market, our solution enables them to automate
marketing and sales processes to drive efficiency with fewer resources.

**_Facilitate Upsell and Cross-Sell Activity Within Our Customers. Our Event Cloud consists of multiple_**
solutions for marketing and managing meetings and events. As of December 31, 2022, 56% of our Event Cloud
customers have subscriptions to more than one of our solutions. We believe there is a significant opportunity to crosssell additional solutions and add-on modules within our existing base of approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers
as of December 31, 2022. As the meetings and events ecosystem digitally transforms, we believe that organizations
will derive even greater value from a platform that drives engagement and enables the seamless management of their
Total Event Program. We also believe that the expanded reach and effectiveness of virtual and hybrid events drive
growth in both the number of events and the number of registrants. As a result, we believe that our renewing Event
Cloud customers are likely to increase their overall contract value through both larger Total Event Programs and the
adoption of additional solutions. Additionally, we believe that we can cross-sell new subscriptions or additional
functionality to the approximately 109,000 planners that have access to CSN free of charge, some of whom also have
paid subscriptions to our other Event Cloud solutions.

Our Hospitality Cloud solution not only connects hotels and venues with tens of thousands of planners, but
also provides a suite of products to market their venues and manage sales and operations of their group business. We
continue to expand our inventory of marketing placements and add specialized tiers for hotels and venues to purchase
and develop software solutions to help manage group business. As we add these new capabilities, we believe that
hoteliers and venue operators will leverage our marketplace offerings to reach buyers at scale and expand the use of
our platform to manage the marketing, sales and operations of their group meetings business more efficiently and
profitably. In addition, our Hospitality Cloud software products have demonstrated compelling adoption momentum
by our customers with headroom for further growth. As of December 31, 2022, 26% of Hospitality Cloud customers
have subscriptions to one or more software products and one or more marketing products. We believe there is a
significant opportunity to cross-sell additional software and marketing solutions within our existing base of
approximately 11,000 Hospitality Cloud customers as of December 31, 2022.

**_Expand Our International Footprint. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand globally and_**
increase our revenue derived from outside of North America, which accounted for 12.0% of total revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2022. In our experience, the adoption rate of event technology outside North America has
typically lagged North American adoption. As global adoption of event technology increases, we expect revenue
derived from outside of North America to increase as a percentage of total revenue. With respect to the Hospitality
Cloud, while our international hotel and venue listings represent approximately 59% of the total venues in CSN as of
December 31, 2022, only a small percentage of our RFPs are sent to these international hotels and venues. If the
volume of international meeting RFPs on CSN increases, we expect our international revenue to expand. We have
sales offices in eight countries across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific (“APAC”) and the Middle East as of
December 31, 2022.

**_Extend Our Product Leadership. We have invested in research and development to build and improve our_**
platform over time. The strength of our platform and solutions has helped to solidify our position as the leading cloudbased platform for event marketing and management and hospitality solutions. We have added additional products
and features over time and regularly implement updates and improvements to our platform in order to improve our
position relative to competitors, meet the needs of our customers and to improve the event experience for all
stakeholders in the event ecosystem.

-----

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

_Certain of the below agreements are subject to continuing negotiation and could change in the definitive_
_documentation._

**Support and Services Agreement**

In connection with the Closing, Cvent expects to enter into a services agreement with Blackstone
Management Partners L.L.C. and Blackstone Capital Partners VIII L.P. (collectively, “BX Management”). Under the
services agreement, Cvent will pay or reimburse BX Management and their affiliates for out-of-pocket costs and

TopCo, LP (“TopCo LP”), Cvent’s indirect parent and the controlling shareholder of Topco. The limited partnership
is expected to govern certain matters relating to ownership of equity securities in TopCo LP (and TopCo LP’s
ownership of shares in Topco), including with respect to the election of directors of Topco, transfer of equity securities
in TopCo LP (including tag-along rights and drag-along rights) and other corporate governance provisions. The limited

-----

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

**New Senior Secured Credit Loan Facilities**

In connection with the Merger, we expect to enter into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that will
govern the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as administrative agent
and collateral agent. The Credit Agreement will provide for (a) the New Term Loan Facility in an aggregate principal
amount of $400 million and (b) the New Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of $115 million.

The Issuer (which is referred to throughout this section as the “Borrower”) is the borrower under the New
Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The New Revolving Credit Facility includes sub-facilities for letters of credit and
short-term borrowings referred to as swing line borrowings. Our Credit Agreement will provide that we will have the
right at any time, subject to customary conditions, to request incremental term loans or incremental revolving credit
commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to (a) the greater of (1) $220 million and (2) an amount equal to
100% of our consolidated EBITDA for the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which
financial statements are internally available, on a pro forma basis, plus (b) additional amounts not to exceed available
capacity under a specified general debt basket, plus (c) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments, repurchases
and redemptions of the term loans under our Credit Agreement and certain other debt secured by liens on the collateral
and permanent revolving credit commitment reductions under our Credit Agreement and any other revolving credit
facilities secured by liens on the Collateral, in each case prior to or simultaneous with the date of any such incurrence
(to the extent not funded with the proceeds of long-term debt other than revolving loans), plus (d) an additional
unlimited amount so long as we (I) in the case of incremental indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on an equal
priority basis (without giving effect to the control of remedies) with the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, do not
exceed a specified pro forma senior lien net leverage ratio (or, so long as we do not exceed the pro forma senior lien
net leverage ratio immediately prior to such incurrence or any related transactions), (II) in the case of incremental
indebtedness that is secured on the collateral on a junior lien basis with respect to the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, do not exceed a specified pro forma secured net leverage ratio (or, so long as we do not exceed the pro
forma secured net leverage ratio immediately prior to such incurrence or any related transactions) and (III) in the case
of unsecured incremental indebtedness (or indebtedness secured by assets that do not constitute collateral securing the
New Senior Secured Credit Facilities), either do not exceed a specified pro forma total net leverage ratio or we satisfy
a specified pro forma interest coverage ratio (or, so long as we do not exceed the pro forma total net leverage ratio or
we satisfy such interest coverage ratio, as applicable, immediately prior to such incurrence or any related transactions).
The lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will not be under any obligation to provide any such
incremental loans or commitments, and any such addition of or increase in loans will be subject to certain customary
conditions precedent and other provisions.

**_Interest rate and fees_**

Borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to bear interest, at the Borrower’s
option, at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin over either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the
highest of (1) the “Prime Rate” in the United States as published in The Wall Street Journal, (2) the federal funds
effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) Term SOFR for a one month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a Term SOFR rate
determined by reference to the applicable Term SOFR rate published on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s
Website for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, subject to a Term SOFR floor to be set forth in the Credit
Agreement.

**_Prepayments_**

It is expected that the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain customary mandatory prepayment
requirements, including with respect to excess cash flow, asset sale proceeds and proceeds from certain incurrences
of indebtedness.

It is expected that we may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities
at any time without premium or penalty; provided, however, that we expect that any voluntary prepayment, refinancing
or repricing of the term loans under the New Term Loan Facility in connection with certain repricing transactions that
occur prior to the six-month anniversary of the closing of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall be subject to


-----

a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the principal amount of the term loans so prepaid, refinanced or repriced, subject
to certain exceptions.

**_Amortization and maturity_**

The term loans under the New Term Loan Facility are expected to amortize in equal quarterly installments
in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount of such term loans, with the balance
being payable on the date that is seven years after the closing of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The New
Revolving Credit Facility will mature five years after the closing of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will not amortize.

**_Guarantee and security_**

All of our obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain hedge agreements and cash
management arrangements provided by any lender party to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any of its
affiliates and certain other persons will be unconditionally guaranteed by Parent, the Borrower (with respect to hedge
agreements and cash management arrangements not entered into by the Borrower) and each of our existing and
subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, with customary
exceptions including, among other things, where providing such guarantees is not permitted by law, regulation or
contract or would result in material adverse tax consequences.

All obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain hedge agreements and cash
management arrangements provided by any lender party to the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any of its
affiliates and certain other persons, and the guarantees of such obligations, will be secured, subject to permitted liens
and other exceptions, by: (i) a perfected senior-priority pledge of all the equity interests of the Borrower and each
wholly-owned material restricted subsidiary of the Borrower that is directly held by the Borrower or a subsidiary
guarantor (limited, with respect to equity interests, to 65% of the voting power issued by first-tier foreign subsidiaries,
CFCs or FSHCOs, as defined under the Credit Agreement) and (ii) perfected senior-priority security interests in
substantially all tangible and intangible personal property of the Borrower and the subsidiary guarantors.

**_Certain covenants and events of default_**

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to contain a number of covenants that, among other
things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

      - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

      - create or incur liens;

      - engage in mergers or consolidations;

      - sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;

      - pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock;

      - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain subordinated indebtedness;

      - make investments, loans and advances;

      - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

      - enter into agreements that prohibit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur
liens on assets; and


-----

      - enter into amendments to certain subordinated indebtedness in a manner materially adverse to the
lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities are expected to contain a springing financial covenant requiring
compliance with a maximum ratio of consolidated senior lien net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, applicable
solely to the New Revolving Credit Facility. The financial covenant will be tested on the last day of any fiscal quarter
(commencing with the second full fiscal quarter to occur after the closing of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities)
only if the aggregate principal amount of borrowings (excluding (i) for the first four fiscal quarters following the
closing of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, revolving borrowings to fund certain costs and fees at such closing
and (ii) outstanding letters of credit (whether or not cash collateralized)) under the New Revolving Credit Facility
exceeds 40% of the greater of (a) the total amount of commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility on such
day and (y) the total amount of commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility at such closing.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will also limit Parent’s activities to being a passive holding
company until the consummation of a qualified IPO and will also contain certain customary affirmative covenants and
events of default for facilities of this type, including relating to a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the
lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be entitled to take various actions, including the
acceleration of amounts due under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by
secured creditors under applicable law.

**Preferred Financing**

In connection with the Closing, Vista has committed, pursuant to a commitment letter (the “Preferred
Commitment Letter”), dated as of March 14, 2023, to invest a portion of their proceeds from the merger consideration
to acquire non-convertible preferred shares with an initial liquidation preference of $1.25 billion to be issued by Topco.
The closing of the Preferred Equity Financing is expected to close substantially concurrently with the consummation
of the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Preferred Commitment Letter.

The Preferred Equity will accrue dividends at an initial rate of 10.5% per annum, compounding quarterly,
which rate will increase by 0.75% per annum beginning on the eighth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger,
subject to a maximum rate of 15.0% per annum (the “Maximum Rate”). Prior to the second anniversary of the closing
date, the Preferred Equity will be redeemable, at Topco’s option, for cash at a make-whole redemption price. On and
after the second anniversary of the closing date, the Preferred Equity will be redeemable, at Topco’s option, based on
the redemption prices set forth in the Preferred Commitment Letter, decreasing ratably to par for any redemption
occurring after the fourth anniversary of the closing date. Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events or
upon an IPO (each, a “Mandatory Redemption Event”), Topco will be required to redeem the Preferred Equity at the
applicable redemption price for cash, or in certain circumstances and at the election of Topco, a number of shares of
the acquiring company or shares of the entity consummating such IPO determined based on the value of the common
equity being sold in such Mandatory Redemption Event. In the case of a Mandatory Redemption Event in which the
holders of common stock of Topco would achieve a gross internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 20% or greater, Topco
will make a “catch up” payment to each holder of Preferred Equity in an amount equal to (x) the amount of dividends
that would have accrued on the Preferred Equity assuming an initial rate of 12.5% minus (y) any make-whole amount
or redemption premium to be paid to a holder of a share of Preferred Equity in connection with such Mandatory
Redemption Event (which “catch up” payment is subject to reduction to the extent necessary to cause the IRR to not
be less than 20% after giving effect to such payment). Beginning on the tenth anniversary of the closing date, holders
of a majority of the outstanding Preferred Equity have the right to demand Topco to engage in a process to effect
either an IPO or a sale of Topco. If Topco fails to consummate such an IPO or sale within twelve months of a demand,
the dividend rate will increase by 1.00% per annum subject to the Maximum Rate. In addition, holders of the Preferred
Equity will have certain information rights as well as consent rights over, among other things, the incurrence of
indebtedness, the making of restricted payments and transactions with affiliates. Vista will be entitled to designate one
non-voting observer to Topco’s board of directors so long as the Preferred Equity remains outstanding.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

Certain terms used in this description are defined under the subheading “—Certain Definitions.” In this
description, (1) the term “Issuer” refers to Capstone Borrower, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and not to any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (2) the term “Merger Sub” refers to Capstone Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer that, upon consummation of the Acquisition, will merge with and into
Cvent Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Cvent”), with Cvent surviving as a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Issuer, and not to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; and (3) the term “Parent” refers to Capstone Intermediate, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation and the direct parent company of the Issuer and not to any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates; and
(4) the terms “we”, “our” and “us” each refer to the Issuer and its consolidated Subsidiaries.

The Issuer will issue $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of      % senior secured notes due 2030
(the “Notes”) under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date among the Issuer, the Guarantors
and Wilmington Trust, National Association as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), the registrar (in such capacity,
the “Registrar”) and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”). See “Transfer Restrictions.”
The Issuer will not be required to, nor does it currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered
under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the Securities Act.
The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act.
Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture. The Issuer does not intend to list the
Notes on any securities exchange.

If the closing of this offering of the Notes occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, then, pending the satisfaction
of the Escrow Conditions, the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be placed in a segregated escrow account
(the “Escrow Account”). If the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined below)
(or such earlier date as the Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent (as defined below) in writing that in its reasonable
judgment the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or the Issuer notifies the Escrow
Agent in writing that the Merger Agreement has been terminated), the Notes offered hereby will be subject to a Special
Mandatory Redemption at a redemption price of 100% of the issue price of the Notes offered hereby, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow
of Gross Proceeds; Mandatory Redemption.” The funds in the Escrow Account will be released and applied to pay for
any such redemption and any unpaid fees or expenses of the Escrow Agent, the Trustee and the other agents under the
Indenture, with any excess amounts to be released to the Issuer.

The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Escrow
Agreement. It does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement, including the definitions therein of certain terms used below. We urge you to
read the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement because they, and not this description, will define your rights as Holders
of the Notes. You may request copies of the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement at our address set forth under
“Where You Can Find More Information.”

**Brief Description of the Notes**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date (if the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Issue Date),
the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer, guaranteed only by Parent and Merger Sub and secured only
by a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account and all amounts on deposit therein. From and after the
Completion Date, the Notes will be:

    - general senior obligations of the Issuer;

    - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right
of payment to the Notes;


-----

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral owned by the Issuer;

    - equal in priority as to the Collateral owned by the Issuer with respect to any Equal Priority Obligations
of the Issuer, including the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations to the extent of the value of such
Collateral;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by Liens on
assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock
and other liabilities of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

**Guarantees**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date (if the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Issue Date),
the Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Parent and Merger Sub. From and after the Completion Date,
Parent and certain of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (as detailed below) will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer’s
existing or future Foreign Subsidiaries, any direct or indirect Subsidiary that is a direct or indirect Domestic Subsidiary
of a direct or indirect Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC, existing or future FSHCO Subsidiaries, any future
Securitization Subsidiaries or any future Captive Insurance Subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the Notes.

The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally guarantee, fully
and unconditionally, on a senior secured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for
payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the
terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture or a supplement thereto.

As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee certain Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release
and discharge as described in this “Description of Notes.”

Each of the Guarantees will be:

    - a general senior obligation of such Guarantor;

    - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor;

    - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated
in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor;

    - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, to the extent of
the value of the Collateral owned by such Guarantor;

    - equal in priority as to the Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to any Equal Priority
Obligations of such Guarantor, including the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations to the extent of
the value of such Collateral;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens
on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and

    - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock
and other liabilities of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the
Issuer).


-----

As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions:

    - the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had approximately $900.0 million in total indebtedness
outstanding, none of which would have been subordinated and all of which would have been senior
secured indebtedness, consisting of $400.0 million of term loan borrowings under the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and approximately $500.0 million of the Notes;

    - the Issuer would have had approximately $115.0 million of availability to incur additional secured
indebtedness under the revolving credit facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; and

From and after the Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries (including Cvent) are expected to be
“Restricted Subsidiaries” unless designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Indenture. Under
certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our existing and future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted
Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture
and will not guarantee the Notes.

As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, after intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented approximately 26.8% of
our revenues, 26.4% of our total assets and 8.9% of our total liabilities. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation,
reorganization or similar proceeding of any of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, such non-guarantor Subsidiaries will
pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including
any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. The Indenture does not limit
the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Subsidiaries. As of the Completion Date, Parent and each Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will guarantee the Notes.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee
from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to
protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s
obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could
be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the
Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be
reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent
transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and the liens securing
the notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing
the notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect
of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all
guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such
other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time
of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.

Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, or consummate a
Division as a Dividing Person, or sell all or substantially all its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor without
limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—
Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.”

Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon:

(1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by
merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock
of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a


-----

Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each
case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with or is not
prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments thereof);

(2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of Indebtedness
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or the release or discharge of such other guarantee or
direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or
as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release
subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and
that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that
such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted
Subsidiaries”);

(3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of
the Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer
a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(4) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or Division of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer
or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation or winding up of such Guarantor, in each case, in
compliance with or in a manner not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

(5) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event;

(6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or in accordance with the provisions
of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) the exercise by the Issuer of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described
under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations
under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or

(8) in the case of Parent, if Parent ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer as a result of a transaction
or designation permitted pursuant to the definition of “Parent”.

Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur,
then the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions reasonably
necessary to provide that the Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (to the extent such
guarantee is required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of
Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and
state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and
the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and
the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received
from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.”

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt
of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer and at the Issuer’s expense, will execute such documents reasonably
requested by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such
Guarantee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the notes to reflect
any such release, discharge or termination. The Trustee shall not be liable for any such release undertaken in reliance
upon any such Officer’s Certificate.


-----

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will issue an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million of Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes
will mature on       , 2030.

Subject to compliance with the covenants described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Liens,” the
Issuer may issue additional Notes (“Additional Notes”) from time to time after this offering under the Indenture. The
Notes offered hereby and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase;
_provided, however, that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for the Additional Notes, unless the Notes and the_
Additional Notes are treated as fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context requires otherwise,
references to “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of Notes” include any Additional Notes
that are actually issued.

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrears on each         and         commencing on       , 2023 to the Holders of Notes of record
on the immediately preceding         and         (whether or not a Business Day), respectively. Interest on the
Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from and
including the Issue Date. If the Issuer delivers global notes to the Trustee for cancellation on a date that is on or after
the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but
excluding, the redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered
at the close of business on such record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of The Depository Trust
Company (“DTC”), and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption
by the Issuer. Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months.

**Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest**

Cash payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes will be payable at the office or
agency of the Issuer maintained for such purpose (the “paying agent”) or, at the option of the Issuer, cash payment of
interest on the Notes may be made through the paying agent by check mailed to the Holders of the Notes at their
respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders; provided, that (a) all cash payments of principal, premium, if
any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held
by DTC or its nominee will be made through the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified by the registered Holder or Holders thereof and (b) all cash payments of principal, premium, if any,
and interest with respect to certificated Notes may, at the option of the Issuer, be made by wire transfer to a U.S. dollar
account maintained by the payee with a bank in the United States if the applicable Holder elects payment by wire
transfer by giving written notice to the Trustee or the Paying Agent to such effect designating such account no later
than 30 days immediately preceding the relevant due date for payment (or such other date as the Trustee may accept
in its discretion). Until otherwise designated by the Issuer, the Issuer’s office or agency will be the office of the Trustee
maintained for such purpose.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes. The initial paying agent for the Notes will
be the Trustee.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars and transfer agents for the Notes. The initial Registrar
and transfer agent will be the Trustee. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes
outstanding from time to time. The paying agent will make payments on, and the transfer agent will facilitate transfer
of, the Notes on behalf of the Issuer.


-----

The Issuer may change the paying agent, registrar or transfer agent without prior notice to the Holders. The
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as a paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A Holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee
may require a Holder to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of
Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer and the transfer agent will not be required
to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption or tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection
with a Change of Control Offer, an Alternate Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. Also, the Issuer and the transfer agent will
not be required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption
of Notes to be redeemed or between record date and payment date. The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as
the owner of the Note for all purposes.

**Security for the Notes**

**_Collateral Generally_**

On the Completion Date, upon consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes and the Guarantees will be
secured by Liens on the Collateral on an equal priority basis (but without regard to the control of remedies) with the
Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations and all other Equal Priority Obligations. The Equal Priority Obligations
may include, as applicable, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other obligations in respect of cash management
services (including Bank Products obligations). Certain secured parties other than the Holders, the Trustee and the
Notes Collateral Agent will have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral benefiting the Holders, particularly the rights described below under “—Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement”.

The Issuer and the Guarantors are and will be able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future which could
share in the Collateral, including Additional Equal Priority Obligations and Obligations secured by Permitted Liens.
With respect to the Issuer and the Guarantors, the amount of such additional Obligations will be limited by the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Under certain circumstances, the amount
of any such additional Obligations could be significant.

By their acceptance of the Notes, the Holders are deemed to have approved the Security Documents and
authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into and perform its obligations under the Security
Documents, binding the Holders to the terms thereof.

**_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_**

The Collateral securing the Notes will not include any of the following assets (the “Excluded Assets”):

(1) any property or assets owned by any Foreign Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary becomes a
Guarantor), any Unrestricted Subsidiary (unless such Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor
at the option of the Issuer) or any Subsidiary which is not a Guarantor;

(2) any lease, license, contract, agreement or other general intangible or any property subject to a
purchase money security interest, Financing Lease Obligation or similar arrangement, in each case
permitted or otherwise not prohibited under the Indenture, to the extent that a grant of a security
interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license, contract, agreement or other general
intangible, Financing Lease Obligations or purchase money arrangement or create a right of
termination in favor of any other party thereto (other than the Issuer or a Guarantor) after giving
effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or other
applicable law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly


-----

deemed effective under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law notwithstanding such
prohibition;

(3) any interest in real property;

(4) any interest in leased real property (including any requirement to deliver landlord waivers, estoppels,
non-disturbance agreements, consents, collateral access letters or other similar requirements);

(5) motor vehicles, aircrafts, airframes, aircrafts engines or helicopters and other assets subject to
certificates of title;

(6) margin stock and Equity Interests of any Person other than the Issuer and each wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Issuer that is a Restricted Subsidiary (that is also not an Excluded Subsidiary (as
defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) (other than any Restricted Subsidiary that is an
Excluded Subsidiary solely pursuant to clause (f) or (j)(y) of the definition thereof in the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities));

(7) any intent-to-use trademark application prior to the filing and acceptance of a “Statement of Use”
or “Amendment to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent, if any, that, and solely during the
period, if any, that granting a security interest in such trademark application prior to such filing
would impair the enforceability or validity, or result in the voiding, of such trademark application
(or any registration that may issue therefrom) under applicable federal law;

(8) any property or assets to the extent a security interest therein would result in material adverse tax
consequences to Parent, the Issuer, any direct or indirect owner of the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s
direct or indirect Subsidiaries, in each case, as reasonably determined by the Issuer in consultation
with the Bank Collateral Agent or the Notes Collateral Agent;

(9) any governmental licenses or state or local franchises, charters and authorizations, to the extent a
security in any such license, franchise, charter or authorization is prohibited or restricted thereby,
after giving effect to the anti-assignment provision of the Uniform Commercial Code and other
applicable Law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly
deemed effective under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law notwithstanding such
prohibition or restriction;

(10) any assets to the extent pledges and security interests therein are prohibited or restricted by (1)
applicable law whether on the Completion Date or thereafter (including any requirement to obtain
the consent of any governmental authority or third party (other than the Issuer or any Guarantor))
or (2) any contract to which such asset is subject binding on the Issuer or any Guarantor or that
would require any consent, approval, license or other authorization of any third party (other than the
Issuer or any Guarantor) or governmental or regulatory authority pursuant to such a contract
(provided that such prohibition or requirement described in this clause (2) either (A) existed on or
prior to the Completion Date or at the time of the acquisition of such asset by the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, and was not incurred in contemplation thereof or (B) is of a
similar type of arrangement as those existing on such date that is entered into in the ordinary course
of business or is consistent with past practice of the Issuer or any Guarantor), in each case, after
giving effect to the anti-assignment provision of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable
law, other than proceeds and receivables thereof, the assignment of which is expressly deemed
effective under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law notwithstanding such
prohibition or restriction;

(11) all commercial tort claims;

(12) any deposit accounts, securities accounts or any similar accounts (including securities entitlements)
(in each case, other than to the extent constituting Collateral) and any other accounts used solely as


-----

payroll and other employee wage and benefit accounts, tax accounts (including, without limitation,
sales tax accounts) and any tax benefits accounts, escrow accounts, fiduciary or trust accounts and
any funds and other property held in or maintained in any such accounts;

(13) letter of credit rights, except to the extent constituting a supporting obligation for other Collateral
as to which perfection of the security interest in such other Collateral may be accomplished by the
filing of a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement (it being understood that no actions shall
be required to perfect a security interest in letter of credit rights, other than the filing of a Uniform
Commercial Code financing statement);

(14) cash and Cash Equivalents (other than cash and Cash Equivalents constituting proceeds of
Collateral);

(15) any particular assets if the burden, cost or consequence of creating or perfecting such pledges or
security interests in such assets is excessive in relation to the benefits to be obtained therefrom by
the Holders under the Notes, the Indenture and the Security Documents as reasonably determined
by the Issuer;

(16) voting Equity Interests in any Foreign Subsidiary, CFC or any FSHCO Subsidiary, in each case,
representing more than 65% of the voting power of all outstanding Equity Interests of such Foreign
Subsidiary, CFC or FSHCO Subsidiary;

(17) [reserved];

(18) so long as the Senior Secured Credit Facilities remain outstanding, any asset that is not pledged and
not required to be pledged to secure obligations arising in respect of the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities (whether pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (and any related
document) as a result of any determination made thereunder, or by amendment, waiver or
otherwise); and

(19) proceeds from any and all of the foregoing assets described in clauses (1) through (18) above to the
extent such proceeds would otherwise be excluded pursuant to clauses (1) through (18) above.

The security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes (other than as set forth in the following proviso)
will not be required to be perfected on the Completion Date, but will be required to be perfected no later than 90 days
after the Completion Date (or such later date as the Bank Collateral Agent may agree with respect to similar obligations
in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) or as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter; _provided,_
_however, the perfection of the security interests (1) in the certificated Equity Interests of the Issuer and, to the extent_
received by the Issuer after use of its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such certificates, the Issuer’s whollyowned Domestic Subsidiaries will be required to be delivered on the Completion Date (subject to the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement) and (2) in other assets with respect to which a Lien may be perfected by the filing of a UCC
financing statement (or equivalent), which UCC financing statement (or equivalent) will be required to be filed as of
the Completion Date.

In addition:

(a) Liens required to be granted from time to time pursuant to the Indenture shall be subject to
exceptions and limitations set forth in the Security Documents;

(b) control agreements or other control or similar arrangements shall not be required with respect to
Cash Equivalents, deposit accounts, securities accounts, commodities accounts or other assets
requiring perfection by control agreements;

(c) no actions in any non-U.S. jurisdiction or required by the laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction shall be
required in order to create any security interests in assets located or titled outside of the United States


-----

(and the Notes Collateral Agent shall not be permitted to take any actions under such laws of any
such non-U.S. jurisdiction) (including any intellectual property rights and foreign intellectual
property) or to perfect any security interests in any such assets (it being understood that there shall
be no Security Document (or other security agreements or pledge agreements) governed under the
laws of any non-U.S. jurisdiction); and

(d) except to the extent that perfection and priority may be achieved by the filing of a financing
statement under the Uniform Commercial Code with respect to the Issuer or a Guarantor, there will
be no requirements as to perfection or priority with respect to any assets or property described in
clauses (b) or (c) of this paragraph.

It is understood and agreed that prior to the discharge of the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations, to
the extent that the Bank Collateral Agent is satisfied with or agrees to any deliveries or documents required to be
provided in respect of any matters relating to the Collateral or make any determination in respect of any matters
relating to the Collateral (including, without limitation, extensions of time or waivers for the creation and perfection
of security interests in, or the obtaining of legal opinions or other deliverables, if applicable, with respect to, particular
assets (including in connection with assets acquired, or Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Completion Date),
the Notes Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be satisfied with such deliveries and/or documents and the judgment of
the Bank Collateral Agent in respect of any such matters shall be deemed to be the judgment of the Notes Collateral
Agent in respect of such matters under the Indenture and the Security Documents.

**_After-Acquired Collateral_**

From and after the Completion Date, and subject to certain limitations and exceptions, if the Issuer or any
Guarantor acquires any property or rights which are of a type constituting Collateral under any Security Document
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any Excluded Assets or assets not required to be Collateral pursuant to the
Indenture or the Security Documents), it will be required to execute and deliver such security instruments, financing
statements and such certificates as are required under the Indenture or any Security Document to vest in the Notes
Collateral Agent a perfected security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in such after-acquired collateral and to take
such actions to add such after-acquired collateral to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture and
the Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such after-acquired collateral to the same
extent and with the same force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, opinions of counsel will not be required in
connection with the addition of new Guarantors or in connection with such Guarantors entering into the Security
Documents or to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security interest in after-acquired collateral owned by
such Guarantors.

**_Further Assurances_**

On or following the Completion Date and subject to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer
and the Guarantors shall execute any and all further documents, financing statements (including continuation
statements and amendments to financing statements), agreements and instruments, and take all further action that may
be required under applicable law in order to grant, preserve, maintain, protect and perfect (or continue the perfection
of) the validity and priority of the security interests created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in
the Collateral.

**_Liens with Respect to the Collateral_**

On the Completion Date, the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into the Security
Documents establishing the terms of the security interests with respect to the Collateral. These security interests will
secure the payment and performance when due of all of the Notes Obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

**_Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Notes Collateral Agent and the Bank Collateral Agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the
same may be amended from time to time or any other intercreditor agreement substantially in the form thereof, the


-----

“Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement”) with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended from time to time
without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Equal Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred
under the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement only the “Controlling Collateral Agent” will have the right
to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be
the Bank Collateral Agent and will remain the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of Equal
Priority Obligations that are Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent
Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling
Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent (other than the initial
Bank Collateral Agent) of the Series of Equal Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal
amount of any then outstanding Series of Equal Priority Obligations (excluding the Series of Senior Secured Credit
Facility Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the “Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent”).

With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling
Secured Party shall, or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial
foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or
over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take
any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any
Shared Collateral.

The “Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling
Collateral Agent, the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent
was the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in
the indenture or other debt facility for the Equal Priority Obligations, and (b) the Controlling Collateral Agent and
each other Collateral Agent’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent certifying that (i)
such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent is the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent and that an event of default, as
defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of Equal Priority Obligations has occurred and is
continuing and (ii) the Equal Priority Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a
result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that Series of Equal
Priority Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date will be stayed and will
not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling
Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared
Collateral or any portion thereof or (2) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in
such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding.

The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Bank Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent
will have no rights to take any action under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared
Collateral unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens with respect to the Shared Collateral, the Controlling
Collateral Agent may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such
Collateral. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to
any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party or
any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies
relating to the Shared Collateral. Each of the Equal Priority Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will
waive any right to) contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf
of any of the Equal Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of Equal Priority
Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in
respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any insolvency
or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any Equal


-----

Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement ) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation
of any such Shared Collateral by any Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party and proceeds of any such
distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such distribution, payments or proceeds, to the paragraph
immediately following) to which the Equal Priority Obligations are entitled under such other intercreditor agreement
shall be applied:

(A) FIRST, in payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such); and

(B) SECOND, subject to the immediately following paragraph, among the Equal Priority Obligations
to the payment in full of the Equal Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, with such proceeds to be
applied to the Equal Priority Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Equal Priority Documents for such Series; provided that following the commencement
of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor, solely as among the
holders of Equal Priority Obligations and solely for purposes of this clause SECOND and not the
indenture or other debt facility for the Equal Priority Obligations, in the event the value of the Shared
Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the Equal Priority
Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other
applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law in such insolvency
or liquidation proceeding, the amount of Equal Priority Obligations of each Series of Equal Priority
Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the Equal Priority
Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable
provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law in such insolvency or
liquidation proceeding. “Post-Petition Interest” for purposes of the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement means any interest or entitlement to fees or expenses or other charges that accrue after
the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, whether or not allowed or
allowable as a claim in any such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; and

(C) THIRD, after the discharge of all Equal Priority Obligations, to the Grantors or their successors or
assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same.

It is the intention of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of Equal Priority
Obligations of such Series (and not the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such Series are
unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of Equal
Priority Obligations), (y) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security
interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening
security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of Equal Priority Obligations) on a
basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations but junior to the security interest
of any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of Equal
Priority Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii)
with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any
Impairment with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne
solely by the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Equal
Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Equal
Priority Obligations permitted by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne
solely by the holders of the Series of such Equal Priority Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the
event the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Equal Priority Obligations or the
Equal Priority Documents governing such Equal Priority Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents
as so modified.

None of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may institute in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other
proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party seeking
damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared


-----

Collateral. In addition, none of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof
marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any Equal Priority Secured Party obtains
possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Equal
Priority Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency
or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor
agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Equal Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared
Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other Equal Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared
Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Equal
Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses
upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then
(whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other
Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Notes and each
other Series of Equal Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and
discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall
be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable
Bankruptcy Law.

_Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_

If the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of
financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the
Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under
any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each Equal Priority Secured Party will agree not to
object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”)
and/or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent opposes
or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that
such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling
Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral
on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Equal Priority Secured
Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens
rank on an equal priority basis with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the Equal Priority
Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with
respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared
Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement
of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other Equal Priority Secured Parties
(other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as
existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case;

(B) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral
pledged to any Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection
with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the Equal Priority
Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP
Financing Liens) as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Equal
Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement;
and


-----

(D) if any Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of
periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the
proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement ; _provided that the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to_
object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor
of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that do not constitute Shared
Collateral; and _provided,_ _further, that the Equal Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate_
protection shall not object to any other Equal Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection
comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Equal Priority Secured Parties in connection
with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The Equal Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series may,
subject to the limitations set forth in the other Equal Priority Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced,
restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to
time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any
Series.

**_Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

If the Issuer or any of the Guarantors were to incur Indebtedness secured by the Collateral with a Junior Lien
Priority relative to the Notes, the Bank Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent and the applicable Junior Lien
Collateral Agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time, the “Junior
**_Lien Intercreditor Agreement”). Such Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement would be entered into without the consent_**
of the Holders. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of
the Holders to add other parties holding Junior Lien Obligations and Equal Priority Obligations permitted to be
incurred under the then extant relevant agreements, or their respective representatives.

Notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or
grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens granted to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured
Parties on the Collateral or of any Liens granted to any Equal Priority Secured Parties on the Collateral (or any actual
or alleged defect in any of the foregoing) and notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, any
applicable law, any Junior Lien Documents or any Equal Priority Documents or any other circumstance whatsoever,
the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Representative, in each case on behalf of itself and each
Junior Lien Secured Party under its Junior Lien Documents, will agree that any Lien on the Collateral securing or
purporting to secure any Equal Priority Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Equal Priority Secured
Parties or other representative, agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, statute,
operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien
on the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Junior Lien Obligations.

Pursuant to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, except as provided below, prior to the
Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent or any person authorized by it will have the
exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the Collateral and will also have the exclusive right to
determine and direct the time, method and place for exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding
with respect thereto.

The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree
pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement that it will not (and will waive any right to) take any action to,
contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of a Lien securing, or the allowability of any
claim asserted with respect to, any Equal Priority Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the
Controlling Collateral Agent or any of the Equal Priority Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor in any
Collateral or other collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations. The Junior
Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of any Collateral Agent to contest
or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the
validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of any Lien securing, or the allowability of any claim asserted


-----

with respect to, any Junior Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the Junior Lien Collateral
Agent or any of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Collateral securing the Junior Lien Obligations.

The Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection
on, such Collateral upon the exercise of remedies or in any bankruptcy proceeding will be applied to the Equal Priority
Obligations prior to application to any Junior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant Equal Priority
Documents until the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has occurred.

In addition, so long as the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has not occurred, none of the Grantors
shall grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property of any Grantor to secure any Junior Lien Obligations
unless it has granted, or concurrently therewith grants, a Lien on such asset or property of such Grantor to secure the
Equal Priority Obligations. If the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Party holds or acquires any
Lien on any assets or property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary securing any Junior Lien Obligations that are not also
subject to the senior priority Liens securing Equal Priority Obligations under the Equal Priority Documents, the Junior
Lien Collateral Agent or such Junior Lien Secured Party (i) will be obligated to notify the Controlling Collateral Agent
promptly upon becoming aware thereof and, unless such Grantor shall promptly grant a similar Lien on such assets or
property to the Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations, must assign such Lien to the Collateral
Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations (but may retain a junior lien on such assets or property subject
to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and (ii) until such assignment or such grant of a similar Lien
to the Collateral Agents, will be deemed to also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the Collateral Agents
as security for the Equal Priority Obligations. Any amounts received by or distributed to any Junior Lien Secured
Party pursuant to or as a result of any Lien granted in contravention of the foregoing shall be subject to the turnover
and related provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If any Equal Priority Secured Party is required in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to
disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar
person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be, or otherwise avoided as, fraudulent or
preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a “Recovery”), whether received as proceeds of
security, enforcement of any right of setoff, recoupment or otherwise, then the Equal Priority Obligations shall be
reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the
Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to a future Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations with respect to all
such recovered amounts. If the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery,
the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall
not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto. The Junior Lien
Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party will agree that none of them shall be
entitled to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in
accordance with the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, whether by preference or otherwise, it being understood and
agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over
for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that so long as the Discharge of Equal Priority
Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or
against the Issuer or any Guarantor, (i) neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any Junior Lien Secured Party
will (x) exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or recoupment) with respect to any
collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, or institute any action or
proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), (y) contest, protest or object
to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought with respect to the Collateral or any other collateral by the Controlling
Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party in respect of the Equal Priority Obligations, the exercise of any
right by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party (or any agent or sub-agent on their
behalf) in respect of the Equal Priority Obligations under any lockbox agreement, control agreement, landlord waiver
or bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority
Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third-party beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party
of any rights and remedies relating to such collateral or any other collateral under the Equal Priority Documents or
otherwise in respect of Equal Priority Obligations, or (z) object to any forbearance by the Equal Priority Secured
Parties from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies
relating to such collateral or any other collateral in respect of Equal Priority Obligations and (ii) except as otherwise


-----

provided in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Controlling Collateral Agent and the Equal Priority Secured
Parties shall have the exclusive right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including setoff, recoupment, and the right
to credit bid their debt), and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions with respect to such
collateral without any consultation with or the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured
Party; provided, however, that (a) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, any Junior Lien Representative may
file a claim, proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations in a manner consistent
with the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (b) any Junior Lien Representative may take any action
(not adverse to the prior Liens on the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations or the rights of the Controlling
Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof) in order to create, prove,
perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its rights in, and perfection and priority of its Lien on, the Collateral, (c)
to the extent not otherwise inconsistent with or prohibited by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Lien
Representative and the Junior Lien Secured Parties may exercise their rights and remedies as unsecured creditors, as
provided in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (d) any Junior Lien Representative may exercise the rights and
remedies provided for in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to seeking adequate protection in an
insolvency or liquidation proceeding, and (e) any Junior Lien Representative and the Junior Lien Secured Parties may
file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary
proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or
Liens of the Junior Lien Secured Parties, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case in accordance
with the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. In exercising rights and remedies with respect to any
collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, the Controlling Collateral
Agent and the Equal Priority Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the Equal Priority Documents and exercise
remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion.
Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or otherwise dispose of
Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with such sale or disposition and to exercise all the rights
and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction and of a secured
creditor under bankruptcy laws of any applicable jurisdiction.

In the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of any specified item of Collateral (including all or
substantially all of the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the Issuer), the Liens granted to the Junior Lien
Representatives and the Junior Lien Secured Parties upon such Collateral to secure Junior Lien Obligations shall
terminate and be released, automatically and without any further action, concurrently with the termination and release
of all Liens granted upon such Collateral to secure Equal Priority Obligations.

The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Equal Priority Documents may be amended,
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with their terms, and the Indebtedness under the Equal
Priority Documents may be refinanced, in each case, without the consent of any Junior Lien Secured Party.

Without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, no Junior Lien Document may be
amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, or entered into, and no Indebtedness under the Junior Lien
Document may be refinanced, to the extent such amendment, restatement, supplement or modification or refinancing,
or the terms of such new Junior Lien Document, would (i) contravene the provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor
Agreement, (ii) change to earlier dates any scheduled dates for payment of principal (including the final maturity date)
or of interest on Indebtedness under such Junior Lien Document or (iii) reduce the capacity to incur Indebtedness for
borrowed money constituting Equal Priority Obligations to an amount less than the aggregate principal amount of
term loans or outstanding notes and aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments, in each case, under the
Equal Priority Documents on the day of any such amendment, restatement, supplement, modification or refinancing.

The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall be
enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable
Bankruptcy Law.


-----

_Certain Matters in Connection with Liquidation and Insolvency Proceedings_

Debtor-in-Possession Financings

The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Secured Party will agree, among other things,
that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the Controlling Collateral
Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party desires to permit (or not object to) the use of cash collateral under
Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable
bankruptcy law and/or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing under Section 364 of the
Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law to be
secured by any collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, then each
Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will not object to such
use of cash collateral and/or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection
therewith (except to the extent permitted by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and, to the extent the Liens
securing the Equal Priority Obligations are subordinated to or on an equal priority basis with respect to such DIP
Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral and any other collateral to such DIP Financing (and all
obligations relating thereto), any adequate protection Liens granted to the Equal Priority Secured Parties, and any
“carve out” for professional and United States Trustee fees agreed to by the Controlling Collateral Agent, on the same
basis as they are subordinated to the Equal Priority Obligations pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.
The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree that notice
received two Business Days prior to the entry of an order approving such usage of cash or other collateral and/or
approving such DIP Financing shall be adequate notice.

Relief from Automatic Stay; Bankruptcy Sales

No Junior Lien Secured Party may (x) seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to any Collateral
without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, or object to any motion for relief from the
automatic stay with respect to the Collateral made by the Controlling Collateral Agent, (y) object to any lawful exercise
by any holder of Equal Priority Obligations of the right to credit bid such claims under Section 363(k) of the
Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law, or to any
sale or other disposition of any Collateral that the Controlling Collateral Agent has consented to, provided that in the
case of such a sale, the parties’ respective Liens will attach to the proceeds of such sale on the same basis of priority
as such Liens existed on the Collateral pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (z) object to any claim
of any holder of Equal Priority Obligations for post-petition interest, fees, costs, expenses or other charges under
Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise (for this purpose ignoring all claims and Liens held by the Junior
Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral).

Adequate Protection

Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will
agree that none of them shall object to (a) any request by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured
Parties for adequate protection in any form, (b) any objection by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority
Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action, or proceeding based on the Controlling Collateral Agent’s or the Equal
Priority Secured Parties’ claiming a lack of adequate protection, or (c) the allowance and/or payment of interest, fees,
expenses, or other amounts of the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate
protection or otherwise under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law. If the Equal Priority Secured Parties (or any subset thereof) are granted
adequate protection in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative
expense claim in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or 364 of the
Bankruptcy Code, as applicable, or any similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law, then
each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, may seek or
request adequate protection in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral and/or a
superpriority administrative expense claim, which Lien and/or superpriority administrative expense claim (as
applicable) will be subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate protection for, and claims with respect
to the Equal Priority Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto), on the same basis as
the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens


-----

securing and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement and
(ii) in the event any Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured
Parties, seek or request adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of (as applicable) a
Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative expense claim, then such Junior Lien
Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, agree that the Equal
Priority Secured Parties shall also be granted (as applicable) a senior Lien on such additional or replacement collateral
as security and adequate protection for the Equal Priority Obligations and/or a senior superpriority administrative
expense claim, and that any Lien on such additional or replacement collateral securing or providing adequate
protection for the Junior Lien Obligations and/or superpriority administrative expense claim shall be subordinated to
the Liens on such collateral securing and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations and any such DIP
Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and any other Liens and claims granted to the Equal Priority Secured
Parties as adequate protection on the same basis as the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien
Obligations are so subordinated to such Liens securing and claims with respect to Equal Priority Obligations under
the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that the Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate
protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition fees and expenses, and/or other cash
payments, then the Junior Lien Representatives shall not be prohibited from seeking adequate protection in the form
of payments in the amount of current post-petition incurred fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as
applicable), subject to the right of the Equal Priority Secured Parties to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of
fees and expenses or other cash payments so sought by the Junior Lien Secured Parties.

Plans of Reorganization

No Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Secured Party (whether in the capacity of a secured
or unsecured creditor) may directly or indirectly propose, support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or
similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the Junior Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent or to the extent
any such plan is proposed or supported by the class of holders of Equal Priority Obligations required under Section
1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will
acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the Junior Lien
Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing
rights in the Collateral, the Junior Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the Equal Priority Obligations
and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed,
confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the Equal Priority Secured Parties and
the Junior Lien Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate
classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan,
then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, will
acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of
senior and junior secured claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect
being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held
by the Junior Lien Secured Parties), the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to
amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect
of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation
proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations, with each
Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, acknowledging and
agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the
Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of
reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Lien Secured Parties.

**Release of Collateral**

The release of property and other assets constituting Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes and the
Equal Priority Obligations shall occur automatically and without further action by the Notes Collateral Agent, the
Trustee or the Holders under any one or more of the following circumstances:


-----

(1) to enable the Issuer and/or one or more Guarantors to consummate the sale, transfer or other
disposition (including by the termination of capital leases or the repossession of the leased property
in a capital lease by the lessor) of such property or assets (to a Person other than a Person required
to grant a Lien on such property or asset to the Notes Collateral Agent under the Security
Documents) to the extent consummated in accordance with, or not prohibited by, the covenant
described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee with respect to the Notes pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture, the release of the Equity Interests in, and property and assets of, such
Guarantor;

(3) all Collateral upon the occurrence of an Investment Grade Event;

(4) the release of Excess Proceeds that remain unexpended after the conclusion of an Asset Sale Offer
conducted in accordance with the Indenture;

(5) if all other liens on such Collateral securing Equal Priority Obligations are released or will be
released simultaneously therewith (other than any release by, or as a result of, payment in full and
irrevocable termination of the Equal Priority Obligations);

(6) if the release of such Lien is approved, authorized or ratified by the Required Holders;

(7) to the extent such property or asset constitutes or becomes an Excluded Asset; or

(8) as described under “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees also will be released automatically and
without further action by the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee or the Holders (i) upon payment in full of the principal
of, together with accrued and unpaid interest on, the Notes and all other Obligations under the Indenture, the
Guarantees and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, are paid, (ii) upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the Indenture as
described below under “Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or a discharge of the Indenture as described
under “Satisfaction and Discharge” or (iii) pursuant to the Security Documents or the Equal Priority Intercreditor
Agreement described above.

Notwithstanding clause (3) above, if, after any Investment Grade Event, both of the Rating Agencies
withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade
Rating (or for the avoidance of doubt, only one Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades
the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating in the event that such Rating Agency was the only
Rating Agency to give an Investment Grade Rating to the Notes), the Issuer and the Guarantors shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions reasonably necessary to provide to the Notes Collateral Agent for its benefit and
the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes valid, perfected, first priority security interests (subject to
Permitted Liens) in the Collateral within ninety (90) days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter.

With respect to any release of Collateral, upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate in compliance with the
Indenture, the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall execute, deliver or acknowledge (at the
Issuer’s expense) any instruments or releases reasonably requested by the Issuer to evidence the release of any
Collateral permitted to be released pursuant to the Indenture or the Equal Priority Documents related thereto or the
Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall be liable for any such
release undertaken in reliance upon any such Officer’s Certificate.


-----

**_Sufficiency of Collateral_**

The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others,
the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar
factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors,
including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner
of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market
value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly
manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive post-petition
interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Notes
exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other first- priority debt that is also secured by the
Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Notes.

**_Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired by any bankruptcy law in the event that any
bankruptcy case or other insolvency or liquidation proceeding were to be commenced by or against the Issuer or any
Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral (and in some cases,
even after). Upon the commencement of a case for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as
the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a
bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval (which
may not be given under the circumstances).

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the
meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be
made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments),
whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the
Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the
payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a
debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the
bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral.

Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral
is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to
the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency”
claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not need to be adequately protected during a
bankruptcy case.

**Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

If the Issue Date occurs prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, concurrently with the closing of the
offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”)
with the Trustee and Wilmington Trust, National Association and/or another nationally recognized financial
institution, as escrow agent (in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes into the Escrow Account. The Issuer will grant to the
Trustee, for its benefit and the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, a first priority security interest in the Escrow
Account and all amounts on deposit therein to secure the Obligations under the Notes. The ability of the Holders of
the Notes to realize upon such funds or securities held in the Escrow Account may be subject to certain bankruptcy
law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer.

The Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the funds held in the Escrow Account
in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will
release funds held in the Escrow Account (the “Release”) to, or at the order of, the Issuer (the date of such release
being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery by the Issuer to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee of


-----

an Officer’s Certificate addressed to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or prior to March 14, 2024 (the “Outside
**_Date”), certifying that the following conditions (collectively, the “Escrow Conditions”) will be met substantially_**
concurrently with or promptly following the Release on the Escrow Release Date:

###### (i) (A) the funds held in the Escrow Account will be used to consummate, or in connection with the
consummation or financing of, the Acquisition, (B) the Acquisition will be consummated
substantially concurrently with the release of the funds from the Escrow Account and (C) the
conditions precedent to borrowing under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities shall have been, or
substantially concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects; and

###### (ii) each of the Issuer’s domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries that
guarantee obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the Escrow Release Date shall
become a Guarantor of the Notes.

In the event that (a) the Escrow Agent has not received the Officer’s Certificate described above on or prior
to the Outside Date, (b) the Issuer shall notify the Escrow Agent in writing that in its reasonable judgment the
Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) the Issuer shall notify the Escrow Agent
in writing that the Merger Agreement has been terminated (each such event described in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above
being a “Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Issuer will redeem the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”)
at a price (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) equal to 100.0% of the issue price of the Notes plus accrued
and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for,
to, but not including, the date of such redemption (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”), which shall be the
third Business Day following the Mandatory Redemption Event (or such date as may be required by the applicable
procedures of DTC).

On or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, funds will be liquidated and released from the Escrow
Account in order to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption.

The Escrow Account is not expected to include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to Holders
of the Notes, which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the funds held in the
Escrow Account, one or more of the Investors will be required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to the
Holders of the Notes plus other amounts needed to discharge the Indenture, pursuant to a commitment provided by
them. Alternatively, in lieu of a commitment provided by the Investors, the Escrow Agreement may, at the option of
the Issuer, provide that on the Issue Date and on the date that is three Business Days prior to each monthly anniversary
of the Issue Date (in each case, unless the Escrow Release Date or Outside Date has occurred), the Issuer will deposit
(or cause to be deposited) to the Escrow Account an amount of U.S. dollars equal to one month of interest on the
Notes (as calculated in accordance with the terms of the Indenture). The Escrow Agreement will provide that on the
date that is three Business Days prior to the Outside Date (unless the Escrow Release Date has occurred), the Issuer
will deposit (or cause to be deposited) to the Escrow Account an amount of U.S. dollars sufficient to pay all regularly
scheduled interest that would accrue on the Notes to, but excluding, the third Business Day following the Outside
Date plus other amounts, if any, needed to discharge the Indenture.

If at any time the Escrow Account contains funds having an aggregate value in excess of the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price as determined by the Issuer, such excess cash may be released to or at the direction of
the Issuer.

By its acceptance of the Notes, each Holder shall be deemed to authorize and direct the Trustee to enter into
and perform its obligations under, if any, the Escrow Agreement.

**Activities Prior to the Release**

Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the primary activities of the Issuer will be restricted to obtaining financing
for the Acquisition (including issuing the Notes), issuing capital stock to, and receiving capital contributions from,
Parent or any other direct or indirect parent entity or owner, performing its obligations in respect of the Notes under


-----

the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement and the escrow agreement relating to the Notes and the purchase agreement with
the Initial Purchasers, performing its obligations under any other document relating to financing for the Acquisition,
performing any obligations under the Merger Agreement and redeeming or repaying the Notes, and any other financing
for the Acquisition, if applicable, and conducting such other activities as are necessary or appropriate in connection
with or reasonably related to the Transactions or to carry out the activities described above.

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

Except as described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuer will not be
required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payment with respect to the Notes. However, under
certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the caption “—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders.” As market conditions warrant, we and our direct and indirect equity holders,
including the Investors, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to
purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Notes, in privately negotiated or open market
transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing
our indebtedness, including the Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance
sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities, or through
other sources. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be
material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with
the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series. In addition, any such purchases made at prices
below the “adjusted issue price” (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation
of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and in related adverse tax consequences to us.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, the Issuer will not be entitled to redeem the Notes at its option prior to      ,
2026. Prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, at any time and from time to time, redeem the Notes, in
whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to, but excluding, the date of redemption (the “Redemption Date”), subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption
Date.

On and after       , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, at any time and from time to time, redeem the
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at the redemption prices
(expressed as percentages of principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, thereon to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
Redemption Date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on         of each of the years indicated
below:

**Notes**
**Redemption**

**Year** **Price**

2026 ........................................................................................................ %
2027 ........................................................................................................ %
2028 and thereafter ................................................................................. 100.000%

In addition, prior to       , 2026, the Issuer may, at its option, at any time and from time to time, redeem
an aggregate principal amount of Notes not to exceed the amount of the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer
from one or more Equity Offerings or a capital contribution to the Issuer made with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or
more Equity Offerings, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to (i)
% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus (ii) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of Notes of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date; provided that (1)


-----

the amount redeemed shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes issued under the Indenture
(including any Additional Notes); (2) at least the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
originally issued under the Indenture on the Issue Date and (y) $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes
remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption (unless, in either case, all Notes are
redeemed or repurchased or to be redeemed or repurchased substantially concurrently); and (3) each such redemption
occurs within 270 days of the date of closing of the applicable Equity Offering.

In addition, at any time on and after         , 2024 and on or prior to         , 2026, the Issuer may,
at its option, redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes outstanding under the Indenture (including any Additional
Notes) with an amount not to exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from any Qualified IPO or a capital
contribution to the Issuer made with the Net Cash Proceeds of any Qualified IPO, upon notice as described under “—
Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to      % of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable Redemption Date, subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior
to or on the Redemption Date.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer
or Asset Sale Offer for the Notes, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such offer and the Issuer, or any third party making
such offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such Holders,
the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not
more than 60 days following such purchase date, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase
at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such offer (which may be less than par and excluding any
early tender or incentive fee in such offer) plus, to the extent not included in the offer payment, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption
Date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate
Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed
by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, or any Debt Fund Affiliate, shall be deemed to be outstanding
for the purposes of such tender offer, Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable.

Notice of any redemption or offer to purchase, whether in connection with an Equity Offering, Change of
Control, Alternate Offer, Asset Sale Offer or other transaction or event or otherwise, may, at the Issuer’s (or, in the
case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) discretion, be given prior to
the completion or occurrence thereof, and any such redemption, offer to purchase or notice may, at the Issuer’s (or, in
the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) discretion, be subject to
one or more conditions precedent (including conditions precedent applicable to different amounts of Notes redeemed),
including, but not limited to, completion or occurrence of the related Equity Offering, Change of Control, Asset Sale
or other transaction or event, as the case may be. The Issuer may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant
provisions in the Indenture, and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made
pursuant to different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different provisions
may have different Redemption Dates or may specify the order in which redemptions taking place on the same
Redemption Date are deemed to occur. In addition, if such redemption or offer to purchase is subject to satisfaction
of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s (or, in the case of a Change of Control
Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) discretion, the redemption or repurchase date may be
delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption or offer to purchase was
sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer (or, in the case of a Change of Control
Offer, a third party making such Change of Control Offer) in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied
(or waived by the Issuer (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a third party making such Change of Control
Offer) in its sole discretion) by the redemption or purchase date, or by the redemption or purchase date so delayed, or
that such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s (or, in the case of a Change of Control Offer, a
third party making such Change of Control Offer) sole discretion. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice
or offer to purchase that payment of the redemption or purchase price and performance of the Issuer’s obligations with
respect to such redemption or offer to purchase may be performed by another Person.


-----

The Issuer, Parent, their direct and indirect equityholders, including the Investors, any of its Subsidiaries and
their respective Affiliates and members of our management may acquire the Notes by means other than a redemption,
whether by tender offer, open market purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise.

**Selection and Notice**

If the Issuer is redeeming or purchasing less than all of the Notes issued under the Indenture at any time,
selection of the Notes to be redeemed or purchased will be made in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC;
_provided that no Notes in denominations of $2,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part._

Notices of redemption or purchase shall be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 10 days (except as set forth in the sixth paragraph under “—Optional Redemption” or in connection
with a special mandatory redemption described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Mandatory Redemption”) but
not more than 60 days (except as set forth in the sixth paragraph under “—Optional Redemption”) before the
redemption date to each Holder of the Notes at such Holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the
procedures of DTC, with a copy to the Trustee and the paying agent, except that redemption notices may be delivered
more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance or a satisfaction
and discharge of the Indenture with respect to the Notes. The Issuer may provide in any redemption or purchase notice
that payment of the redemption price and the performance of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption
or purchase may be performed by another Person. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, any notice of redemption
that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be redeemed.

With respect to Notes represented by certificated notes, the Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the original Note;
_provided that new Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in_
excess thereof. Notes called for redemption or purchase become due on the date fixed for redemption or purchase,
unless such redemption or purchase is conditioned on the happening of a future event. On and after the Redemption
Date or purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption or purchase price, interest ceases
to accrue on the Notes called for redemption or purchase.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Completion Date, unless the Issuer
has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under
“—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described
below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase,
subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the
Issuer will send (or cause to be sent) notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with
a copy to the Trustee and the paying agent, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the
security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC with the following information:

(1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control,”
and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for
payment by the Issuer;

(2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60
days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case
of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described
below;

(3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;


-----

(4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted
for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of
Control Payment Date;

(5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on
the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the
paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business
on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new
Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The
unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof;

(7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and shall describe each
such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control
Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is sent)
as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and
such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied
or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as
so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the
Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived;

(8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control covenant,
that a Holder must follow; and

(9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer
to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business
on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile
transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes
tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes, or a
specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Notes purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes or withdraw such
election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase
of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff
of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law:

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and


-----

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with
an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuer.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating
to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of
control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (which may include a Change of Control
under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities and/or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not
refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or such future Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts
outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable
and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down.

Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to
make any required repurchases.

The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no present intention to
engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the
future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including
acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture,
but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure
or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the
Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Required Holders. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all
Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in
contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) have made an offer to purchase (an
“Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control
Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made
in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for
the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer.

A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with
respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but
the Change of Control Offer and the Alternate Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable
law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.


-----

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified with
the written consent of the Required Holders.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
consummate an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including, but
not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset
Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer at the time of
contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, with respect to any Asset Sale in excess of the greater
of (x) $67.5 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration for such
Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Completion Date (on a cumulative basis),
received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash
Equivalents; provided that the amount of:

(a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on
the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in
the footnotes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance
sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted
Subsidiary’s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or
increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the
Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their
terms subordinated to the Notes (other than intercompany liabilities owing to a Restricted
Subsidiary being disposed of), that are (i) assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or
a third party in connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written agreement which
releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities or (ii)
otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer
acting in good faith to be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash
Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received or expected to be received) or
by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalents within 180 days following
the closing of such Asset Sale; and

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with
all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at
that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $90.0 million and (ii) 40.0% of LTM
EBITDA (net of any non-cash consideration converted into Cash Equivalents) at the time
of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (or, at the Issuer’s option, at the
time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), with the fair market value of each item
of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for
purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

Within 24 months after the later of (A) the date of any Asset Sale pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and
(B) the receipt of any Net Proceeds of such Asset Sale, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, at its option, may
apply an amount not to exceed the Applicable Asset Sale Percentage of the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale (the
“Applicable Proceeds”),


-----

(1) to reduce or offer to reduce Indebtedness (through a redemption, prepayment, repayment or
purchase, as applicable) as follows:

(a) Obligations under the Notes;

(b) Equal Priority Obligations (other than the Notes); _provided that if the Issuer or any_
Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce any Equal Priority Obligations other than the Notes,
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will either (A) reduce Obligations under the Notes
on a pro rata basis with such other Equal Priority Obligations by, at its option, (x)
redeeming Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or (y) purchasing Notes
through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices
(which may be below par), or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set
forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes on a ratable
basis with such other Equal Priority Obligations for no less than 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, thereon up to the
principal amount of Notes to be repurchased;

(c) Obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) to the extent such Applicable Proceeds are from an Asset Sale of property or assets of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, Obligations of the Issuer or a
Subsidiary Guarantor other than Subordinated Indebtedness and other than Indebtedness
owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that to the extent the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary makes an offer to redeem, prepay, repay or purchase any
Obligations pursuant to any of the foregoing clauses (a)-(d) at a price of no less than 100%
of the principal amount thereof, to the extent the relevant creditors do not accept such
offering, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have applied an
amount of the Applicable Proceeds equal to such amount not so accepted in such offer, and
such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds (and such amount shall
instead constitute Declined Proceeds); or

(2) to make (a) an Investment in any one or more businesses, provided that such Investment in any
business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business
such that it constitutes or continues to constitute a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) capital expenditures or
(c) acquisitions of other properties or assets that, in each of (a), (b) and (c), are used or useful in a
Similar Business or replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset
Sale; provided that the Issuer may elect to deem Investments, capital expenditures or acquisitions
within the scope of the foregoing clauses (a), (b) or (c), as applicable, that occur prior to the receipt
of the Applicable Proceeds to have been made in accordance with this clause (2) so long as such
deemed Investments, capital expenditures or acquisitions shall have been made no earlier than the
earliest of (x) the notice of such Asset Sale to the Trustee, (y) the execution of a definitive agreement
relating to such Asset Sale or (z) 180 days prior to the consummation of such Asset Sale; or

(3) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided, that a binding commitment or letter of intent entered into not later than the end of such 24-month_
period shall be treated as a permitted application of the Applicable Proceeds from the date of such commitment or
letter of intent so long as the Issuer, or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment or letter of intent with
the good faith expectation that such Applicable Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment or letter of intent
within six months of the end of such 24-month period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) or, in the event any Acceptable
Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Applicable Proceeds are applied in connection
therewith, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a “Second
**_Commitment”) within six months of such cancellation or termination;_** _provided further_ that if any Second


-----

Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Applicable Proceeds are applied, then such
Applicable Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that the application of any or all of
the Applicable Proceeds of any Asset Sale or Casualty Event by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary
Guarantor (a “Non-Guarantor Disposition”) (A) is (x) prohibited or delayed by or would violate or conflict with
applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other
organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States (including for the avoidance
of doubt restrictions, prohibitions or impediments relating to financial assistance, corporate benefit, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance and similar legal principles, restrictions on upstreaming and/or cross-streaming of Cash
Equivalents intra-group and relating to the fiduciary and/or statutory duties of the directors (or equivalent Persons) of
the Issuer and/or any of its Subsidiaries) or would conflict with the fiduciary and/or statutory duties of such
Subsidiary’s directors (or equivalent Persons), or (B) would result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management or
consultant of such Subsidiary, an amount equal to the portion of such Applicable Proceeds so affected will not be
required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor; provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which
the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Applicable
Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, the applicable organizational document or agreement or the
applicable other impediment, an amount equal to such amount of Applicable Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated
will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts
were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant or (ii) to the extent that
the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Applicable Proceeds of any Non-Guarantor
Disposition could have a material adverse tax or cost consequence with respect to such Applicable Proceeds (which
for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates and/or their equityholders would incur a tax liability, including as a
result of a tax dividend, a deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or a withholding tax), the Applicable
Proceeds so affected may be retained by the applicable Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor and
an amount equal to such Applicable Proceeds will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. The
non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance
of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be
construed to require the Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

Any Applicable Proceeds (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately
preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second
preceding paragraph in excess of the Excess Proceeds Threshold will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”;
_provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the_
second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is
accepted by any Holders and any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the
second preceding paragraph that are not accepted shall be deemed to be Declined Proceeds. When the aggregate
amount of such Applicable Proceeds exceeds $110.0 million in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”),
the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the
terms of any other Equal Priority Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the
Collateral disposed of, to the holders of such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, to purchase the
maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such other Equal Priority
Obligations or other Obligations that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to $1,000, or an integral
multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case
of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less),
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such other Equal Priority Obligations or other
Obligations, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
agreement(s) governing such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations. The Issuer will commence an
Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds
exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Applicable
Proceeds by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Applicable Proceeds prior to the time period that may


-----

be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”)
in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”).

To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such other Equal
Priority Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral disposed of, as
the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or
in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the
case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited
under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or such other Equal
Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount
offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase
the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such other Equal Priority Obligations or other
Obligations, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if
applicable) of the Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, tendered
with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the
case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale
Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion)
that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any
remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion). Additionally, the Issuer may, at their option,
make an Asset Sale Offer using Applicable Proceeds at any time after the consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon
consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not
be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited
under the Indenture.

An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect
to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Asset
Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents).

Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Applicable Proceeds in
any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase
of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that
the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to
which the Issuer become a party may contain restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an
Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer are prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent
of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If
the Issuer do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing
Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture
which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture that will apply to the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries.


-----

If on any date following the Completion Date, (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from either of
the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the
events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”
and the date thereof being referred to as the “Suspension Date”), then, the covenants specifically listed under the
following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum will no longer be applicable
to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”) until the occurrence of the Reversion Date (as defined below):

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred
Stock”;

(4) the entire fourth and sixth paragraphs of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially
All Assets”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Issuer may not designate any of its
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes
will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are
not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on
any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) both of the Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or
downgrade the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating (or for the avoidance of doubt, only
one Rating Agency withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes below an
Investment Grade Rating in the event that such Rating Agency was the only Rating Agency to give an Investment
Grade Rating to the Notes), then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the
Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the Suspension
Date and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” The Guarantees of the
Guarantors will be suspended during the Suspension Period. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a Covenant
Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds from any Asset Sales shall be reset to zero.

During the Suspension Period, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be entitled to incur Liens to the
extent provided for under “—Liens” (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens) to the extent provided for in such
covenant and any Permitted Liens which may refer to one or more Suspended Covenants shall be interpreted as though
such applicable Suspended Covenant(s) continued to be applicable during the Suspension Period (but solely for
purposes of the “—Liens” covenant and the “Permitted Liens” definition and for no other covenant).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken
by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement will give rise to a Default or Event of
Default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes, and no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to exist or
have occurred as a result of any failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply with any of the Suspended
Covenants during the Suspension Period; _provided,_ that (1) with respect to Restricted Payments made after such
reinstatement, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be calculated as though the covenant
described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the
Suspension Period (including with respect to a Limited Condition Transaction entered into during the Suspension
Period); (2) all Indebtedness incurred or committed, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the
Suspension Period (or deemed incurred or issued in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into


-----

during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;
(3) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during any
Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Transactions with Affiliates”; (4) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (1) through (3) of the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries” that
becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
Subsidiaries”; (5) no Subsidiary of the Issuer shall be required to comply with the covenant described under “—
Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” after such reinstatement with respect to any
guarantee or obligation entered into by such Subsidiary during any Suspension Period; and (6) all Investments made
during the Suspension Period (or deemed made in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction entered into
during the Suspension Period) will be classified to have been made under clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted
Investments.”

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated after the Reversion Date, (1) no Default,
Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees with
respect to the Suspended Covenants, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for any
actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, in each case as a result of a failure to comply with the
Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (or, upon termination of the Suspension Period or after that time
based solely on any action taken or event that occurred during the Suspension Period), and (2) following a Reversion
Date, the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default, to
honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations arising during any Suspension
Period and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The
Trustee shall have no duty to (i) monitor the ratings of the Notes, (ii) ascertain whether a Covenant Suspension Event
or Reversion Date have occurred, or (iii) notify the Holders of any of the foregoing.

**_Limited Condition Transactions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket, test or ratio under the Indenture or compliance with any
provision of the Indenture in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions
related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or assumption of Liens,
repayments, Restricted Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and
Asset Sales or any disposition, issuance or other transaction excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale”), in each
case, at the option of the Issuer, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, Parent, a direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer,
or any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the “Testing Party,” and the election to
exercise such option, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination for availability under any such basket, test or ratio
or whether any such action or transaction is permitted (or any requirement or condition therefor is complied with or
satisfied (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default)) under the Indenture shall be
deemed to be the date (the “LCT Test Date”) either (a) the definitive agreements or letter of intent (or, if applicable,
a binding offer, or launch of a “certain funds” tender offer) for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into
(or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a notice, declaration or making of a Restricted Payment or similar event) or
(b) solely in connection with an acquisition to which the United Kingdom City Code on Takeovers and Mergers or
similar law or practices in other jurisdictions apply, the date on which a “Rule 2.7 announcement” of a firm intention
to make an offer or similar announcement or determination in another jurisdiction subject to similar laws in respect of
a target of a Limited Condition Transaction, and, in each case, if, after giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition
Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence,
issuance or assumption of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the
incurrence or assumption of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries
or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and Asset Sales or any disposition, issuance or other transaction excluded from the
definition of “Asset Sale”) and any related pro forma adjustments, disregarding for the purposes of such pro forma


-----

calculation any borrowing under a revolving credit, working capital or letter of credit facility), as if they had occurred
at the beginning of the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters ending prior to the LCT Test Date for which
internal consolidated financial statements of the Issuer are available, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
would have been permitted to take such actions or consummate such transactions on the relevant LCT Test Date in
compliance with such ratio, test or basket (and any related requirements and conditions), such ratio, test or basket (and
any related requirements and conditions) shall be deemed to have been complied with (or satisfied) for all purposes
(in the case of Indebtedness, for example, whether such Indebtedness is committed, issued or incurred at the LCT Test
Date or at any time thereafter); provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters
shall have become available, the Testing Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests or
baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be
deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in
the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, tests or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions)
shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition
Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence,
issuance or assumption of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock and the use of proceeds thereof, the
incurrence or assumption of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiaries
or Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and Asset Sales or any disposition, issuance or other transactions excluded from the
definition of “Asset Sale”) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate based on the indicative interest margin contained in any
financing commitment documentation with respect to such Indebtedness or, if no such indicative interest margin
exists, as reasonably determined by the Testing Party in good faith.

For the avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has made an LCT Election, (1) if any of the ratios, tests or
baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test
Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with, including as a result of fluctuations in any
such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in exchange rates or EBITDA or total assets of the Issuer or the
Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or
action, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as
a result of such fluctuations; provided that if such ratios, tests or baskets improve as a result of such fluctuations, such
improved ratios, tests and/or baskets may be utilized; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to
the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or
tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied
(including due to the occurrence or continuation of a Default or an Event of Default), such requirements and conditions
will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in
connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction (including without
limitation a separate Limited Condition Transaction) following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of
the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement, the
date of notice or offer or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in a notice for such Limited Condition
Transaction is terminated, expires or passes, as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited
Condition Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto.

In connection with any action being taken in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes
of determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture which requires that no Default, Event of Default or
specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is continuing or would result from any such action, as
applicable, such condition shall, at the option of the Testing Party, be deemed satisfied, so long as no Default, Event
of Default or specified Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date of the definitive agreement, the date of notice
or offer or date for redemption, purchase or repayment for such Limited Condition Transaction, as applicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has exercised an LCT Election, and any Default, Event of Default or specified
Event of Default occurs following the date the definitive agreements (or, if applicable, the date of delivery of a notice,
declaration or making of a Restricted Payment or similar event) for the applicable Limited Condition Transaction were
entered into and prior to the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such Default, Event of Default
or specified Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining
whether any action being taken in connection with such Limited Condition Transaction is permitted under the
Indenture.

**_Certain Compliance Calculations_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred, assumed or issued, any Lien is incurred or assumed, any Restricted
Payment is made or other transaction is undertaken (including a Limited Condition Transaction) in reliance on a ratio
basket based on the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated
Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio or other ratio-based test, such ratio(s) shall be calculated with
respect to such incurrence, issuance or other transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under any
other non-ratio-based basket substantially concurrently. Each item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock that is incurred, assumed or issued, each Lien incurred and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to
have been incurred, assumed, issued or taken first, to the extent available, pursuant to the relevant Consolidated
Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated
Total Debt Ratio test. For the avoidance of doubt, when testing the availability under a ratio basket for purposes of
making a Restricted Payment, Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) incurred, assumed or issued the proceeds of which
are being utilized to make a Restricted Payment utilizing a non-ratio basket shall not be given effect.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is committed, incurred, assumed or issued, any Lien is committed, incurred,
assumed or issued, any Restricted Payment is made or any other transaction is undertaken (including a Limited
Condition Transaction) in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated
Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio or other ratio-based
test, such ratio(s) shall be calculated without regard to the commitment or incurrence of any Indebtedness under any
revolving facility or letter of credit facility (1) immediately prior to or in connection therewith or (2) used to finance
working capital needs of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as reasonably determined by the Issuer).

If a proposed action, matter, transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one
applicable basket, permission or threshold under the Indenture, the Issuer shall be entitled to divide or classify or later
divide or reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such action, matter,
transaction or amount (or a portion thereof) between such baskets, permission or thresholds as it shall elect from time
to time.

The Indenture shall provide that any calculation, test or measure that is determined with reference to the
Issuer’s financial statements (including, without limitation, EBITDA, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated
Net Income, Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt
Ratio, Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, Fixed Charges, and clause (2)(a) of the first paragraph under “—
Limitation on Restricted Payments”) may be determined with reference to the financial statements of a direct or
indirect parent entity of the Issuer instead, so long as such calculation, test or measure would not differ by more than
an immaterial amount when using the financial statements of such direct or indirect parent entity of the Issuer as
compared to if such calculation, test or measure were made using the Issuer’s financial statements (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer).

Any ratios, tests or baskets required to be satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under the
Indenture shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to
one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down
to the nearest number (with a rounding up if there is no nearest number).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary takes an action which at the time of the taking of such action would
in the good faith determination of the Issuer be permitted under the applicable provisions of the Indenture based on
the financial statements available at such time, such action shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the
Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments, modifications or restatements made in good faith to such
financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income, EBITDA or other applicable financial metric.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:


-----

(I) declare or pay any dividend or make any payment or distribution on account of the Issuer’s, or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries’, Equity Interests (in each case, solely to a holder of Equity Interests
in such Person’s capacity as a holder of such Equity Interests), including any dividend, payment or
distribution payable in connection with any merger, amalgamation or consolidation other than:

(a) dividends, payments and distributions by the Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other
than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase
such Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) or Subordinated Shareholder
Funding; or

(b) dividends, payments and distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of
any dividend, payment or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of
securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Subsidiary, the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend,
payment or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of
securities;

(II) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Issuer
or any direct or indirect parent company of the Issuer, including any purchase, redemption,
defeasance, acquisition or retirement in connection with any merger, amalgamation or
consolidation, in each case held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

(III) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for
value, in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any
Material Subordinated Indebtedness, other than:

(a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
Stock and Preferred Stock”; or

(b) the payment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance or other acquisition or
retirement for value of Material Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of
satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case
due within one year of the date of payment, redemption, purchase, repurchase, defeasance
or acquisition or retirement;

(IV) make any payment (whether of principal, interest or other amounts) on or with respect to, or
purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Material Subordinated
Shareholder Funding (other than any payment of interest thereon in the form of additional
Subordinated Shareholder Funding); or

(V) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (I) through (V) above (other than any
exceptions thereto) being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of
such Restricted Payment:

(1) in the case of a Restricted Payment described under clauses (I) and (II) above and made pursuant to

applicable Subsidiaries; provided that the permitted payment pursuant to this clause (20) with
respect to any Taxes of any Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be limited to the amount actually paid with
respect to such period by such Unrestricted Subsidiary to the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(21) any Restricted Payment made in connection with any Permitted Intercompany Activities;

(22) the Issuer may make any Restricted Payments to any direct or indirect parent for nominal value per
right, of any rights granted to all holders of Capital Stock of the Issuer (or any direct or indirect
parent of the Issuer) pursuant to any equityholders’ rights plan adopted for the purpose of protecting
equityholders from unfair takeover practices;

(23) the Restricted Subsidiaries may make Restricted Payments in connection with the acquisition of
additional Capital Stock in any Restricted Subsidiary from minority equityholders; and

(24) the Issuer may make Restricted Payments to pay for the redemption, discharge, defeasance,

Parent (or any direct or indirect parent thereof) or the Issuer from a former investor of a business
acquired in an Acquisition or other Investment or a current or former employee, officer, director,
manager, or consultant or independent contractor of a business acquired in an Acquisition or other
Investment (or their Controlled Investment Affiliates or Immediate Family Members), which
Capital Stock was issued as part of an earn-out or similar arrangement in the acquisition of such
business, and which redemption, acquisition, retirement or repurchase relates the failure of such
earn-out to fully vest;

_provided, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, (a) any Restricted Payment under clause (11)(iii)_
above other than a Restricted Investment, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur
as a consequence thereof or (b) any Restricted Investment permitted under clause (11)(iii) above, no Event of Default
under clauses (1), (2) or (6) of the first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” shall have occurred and be
continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a proposed Restricted Payment
(or a portion thereof) meets the criteria of clauses (1) through (24) above and/or one or more of the clauses contained
in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” or is entitled to be made pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,
the Issuer will be entitled to divide or classify or later divide or reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date
of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) between such clauses (1) through (24) and


-----

such first paragraph and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” in any
manner that otherwise complies with this covenant.

As of the Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are expected to be Restricted Subsidiaries. The
Issuer will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the definition
of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all
outstanding Investments by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so
designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount determined as set forth in the penultimate sentence
of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment in such amount
would be permitted at such time, pursuant to this covenant or pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Investments,”
and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not
be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, this covenant shall not restrict the making of any “AHYDO catch-up payment”
with respect to, and required by the terms of, any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture.

Clause (2)(a)(ii) of the first paragraph of this covenant is based on the amount calculated pursuant to clause
(b) of the definition of “Cumulative Credit” in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which will be defined as the
greatest of (x) the cumulative retained excess cash flow amount (defined as excess cash flow that is not required to
prepay loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), (y) 50% of consolidated net income (defined in a manner
consistent with Consolidated Net Income in the Indenture) and (z) cumulative EBITDA minus 1.5x Consolidated
Interest Expense (each as defined in a manner consistent with the corresponding terms in the Indenture).

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise
(collectively, “incur” and collectively, an “incurrence”) with respect to any Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) and the Issuer will not issue any shares of Disqualified Stock and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor
to issue Preferred Stock; provided, that the Issuer may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue
shares of Disqualified Stock, and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) and issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor
may issue shares of Preferred Stock, if (i) the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio on a consolidated basis of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 or is equal to or greater than
immediately prior to such incurrence and any related transactions or (ii) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio on a
consolidated basis of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for
which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued would have been equal to or less than
5.25 to 1.00 or is equal to or less than immediately prior to such incurrence and any related transactions, in each case
determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional
Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had been issued, as the case may be, and
the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to:

(1) Indebtedness incurred pursuant to any Credit Facilities by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder (with letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the face amount
thereof); provided that immediately after giving effect to any such incurrence or issuance (including
pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), the then outstanding aggregate principal
amount of all Indebtedness incurred or issued under this clause (1) does not exceed the sum of (a)
(x) $515.0 million, plus (y) an amount equal to the greater of (A) $220.0 million and (B) 100.0% of


-----

LTM EBITDA; and (b) an additional amount after all amounts have been incurred under clause
(1)(a)(x), if after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional amount (including a
pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), (x) if such additional Indebtedness is secured
by the Collateral on an equal priority basis with the Liens securing the Notes (without giving effect
to the control of remedies), the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio would have been equal to or
less than 4.75 to 1.00 or the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio is equal to or less than
immediately prior to such incurrence and any related transactions or (y) if such additional
Indebtedness is secured by the Collateral on a junior lien basis to the Liens securing the Notes, the
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio would have been equal to or less than 5.00 to 1.00 or the
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio is equal to or less than immediately prior to such incurrence and
any related transactions;

personal), equipment or any other asset, whether through the direct purchase of assets or the Capital
Stock of any Person owning such assets, in an aggregate principal amount (together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) not to exceed the sum of (i) the greater of (a) $90.0
million and (b) 40.0% of LTM EBITDA and (ii) additional amounts (including at any time prior to
the utilization of amounts under clause (i) above) so long as the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt
Ratio, determined on a pro forma basis (treating all Indebtedness incurred under this clause (4) as
equal priority Indebtedness for such purpose), would have been equal to or less than 4.75 to 1.00 (in
each case, determined at the date of incurrence or issuance on a pro forma basis (including a pro
forma application of the net proceeds therefrom)); it being understood that any Indebtedness,

Restricted Subsidiary could have incurred such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on this clause (4) and (B) Financing Lease

clauses or under the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that all term Indebtedness outstanding
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the Completion Date will be treated as incurred on the
Completion Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph above;

(2) the Issuer will be entitled to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock in more than one of the types of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
described in the first and second paragraphs above;

(3) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that
is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause of
the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’
acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, then such other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock shall not be
included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred
Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption
or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the
liquidation preference thereof; and

(6) for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Equal
Priority Debt Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as
applicable, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second
paragraph above or the creation or incurrence of any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted
Liens,” the Issuer may elect, at its option, to treat all or any portion of the committed amount of any


-----

Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien, as the case
may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Reserved
**_Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if such Consolidated_**
Interest Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio
or Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, is satisfied with respect thereto on such election
date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters
of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to be permitted under this covenant
or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not the Consolidated Interest
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or
the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or
reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is met;
_provided that for purposes of subsequent calculations of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio,_
the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio, Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio or the Consolidated
Total Debt Ratio, as applicable, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be
outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments
are outstanding or until the Issuer revokes an election of a Reserved Indebtedness Amount.

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of LTM EBITDA under this covenant is being refinanced and
such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock thereunder
to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock will be deemed to have been incurred under the applicable
provision so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus amounts permitted by the next sentence. Any Refinancing Indebtedness
and any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted to be incurred under the Indenture to refinance
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clauses (1)-(38) above shall be deemed to include additional Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay accrued but unpaid interest or dividends, premiums (including
tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including
original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the U.S. Dollar Equivalent principal amount or liquidation
preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock was, at the option of the Issuer, first committed or first incurred or upon execution of the definitive
documentation in respect thereof; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount or liquidation preference of such refinancing
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock does not exceed (a) the principal amount or liquidation preference
of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued
but unpaid interest, fees, underwriting or initial purchaser discounts, premiums (including tender premiums) and other
costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with such
refinancing.

The principal amount or liquidation preference of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, if incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the
currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.


-----

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness
merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because
it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is secured by different collateral or issued or
guaranteed by other obligors.

**_Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,
assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) (each, a “Subject Lien”) that secures Obligations under
any Indebtedness or any related guarantee of Indebtedness, on any Collateral, unless (i) such Subject Lien expressly
has Junior Lien Priority on the Collateral relative to the Notes and the Guarantees or (ii) such Subject Lien is a
Permitted Lien.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The _“Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such_
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original
issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_**

_The Issuer. The Issuer may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into, consummate a Division_
as the Dividing Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person
unless:

(1) (a) the Issuer is the surviving Person or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation, amalgamation, merger or winding up or Division (if other than the Issuer) or to which

of the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the applicable Security Documents, pursuant to
supplemental indentures or other applicable documents or instruments and (ii) is a Person organized
or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or the laws of the United
States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia, or any territory thereof;

(2) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default described under clause (1), (2) or (6) of the
first paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” exists;

(3) the Issuer or, if applicable, the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and, in circumstances involving a supplemental indenture, an Opinion of Counsel, each,
as applicable, stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indentures,
if any, comply with the Indenture; and

(4) to the extent any assets of the Person which is merged, consolidated or amalgamated with or into
the Issuer are assets of the type which would constitute Collateral under the Security Documents,
the Issuer or the Successor Company, as applicable, will take such action, if any, as may be
reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to be made subject to the Lien of the
applicable Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required in the Indenture or the
applicable Security Documents and shall take all reasonably necessary action so that such Lien is
perfected to the extent required by the applicable Security Documents.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes
and the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.

(2) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or amalgamate with or merge with or into or wind up

(3) the Issuer may consolidate or amalgamate with or merge with or into or wind up into, consummate
a Division as the Dividing Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose all or
part of its properties and assets to an Affiliate of the Issuer solely for the purpose of reorganizing
the Issuer in the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof so
long as the amount of Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased
thereby.

_Subsidiary Guarantors._ Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing release of a
Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or transfer of a Subsidiary Guarantor, no Subsidiary Guarantor will, and the Issuer
will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not such
Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) (a) (i) such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person or (ii) the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger or winding up (if other than such Subsidiary
Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made (such Person being herein called the “Successor Person”)
expressly assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture,
the applicable Security Documents and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s related Guarantee
pursuant to supplemental indentures or other applicable documents or instruments;

(b) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default described under clause (1), (2) or

to be made subject to the Lien of the applicable Security Documents in the manner and to
the extent required in the Indenture or the applicable Security Documents and shall take all
reasonably necessary action so that such Lien in perfected to the extent required by the
applicable Security Documents; or

(2) the transaction is not prohibited by the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”; or

(3) in the case of assets comprised of Equity Interests of Subsidiaries, such Equity Interests are sold,
assigned, transferred, leased, conveyed or otherwise disposed of to the Issuer or one or more
Restricted Subsidiaries.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person will succeed to, and be
substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Subsidiary Guarantor may (a) merge or consolidate or amalgamate with
or into, wind up into, consummate a Division as the Dividing Person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise

to the requirements set forth in the second or fourth preceding paragraphs.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All
Assets” covenant, the Issuer may contribute Capital Stock of any or all of its Subsidiaries to any Subsidiary Guarantor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) this covenant will not apply to the Transactions and (ii) the first paragraph
of this covenant will not apply with respect to the sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of
substantially all property or assets of the Issuer if such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition
also constitutes a Change of Control for which a Change of Control Offer is made to Holders pursuant to the covenant
described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control”.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or
enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with any
Affiliate of the Issuer (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or
consideration in excess of the greater of (i) $100.0 million and (ii) 45.0% of LTM EBITDA at such time, unless such
Affiliate Transaction is on terms (when taken as a whole) that are not materially less favorable to the Issuer or its
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis or, if in the good faith judgment of the
Issuer, no comparable transaction is available with which to compare such Affiliate Transaction, such Affiliate
Transaction is otherwise fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view and when such
transaction is taken in its entirety.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) (a) transactions between or among the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or any entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) and (b) any merger, amalgamation

value fee upon the consummation of a corporate event, including an initial public equity offering)
pursuant to the Support and Services Agreement, or any amendment thereto or replacement thereof

judgment of the Issuer to the Holders when taken as a whole, as compared to the Support and
Services Agreement as in effect immediately prior to such amendment or replacement and (b) the
payment of indemnification and other similar amounts to the Investors and reimbursement of
expenses of the Investors;

its Restricted Subsidiaries, including in connection with the Transactions;

(5) transactions in which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, delivers to
the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or stating that the terms are not
materially less favorable, when taken as a whole, to the Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary
than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis;

(6) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Completion Date, or any amendment or

a Qualified IPO and any similar agreements which it (or any parent company of the Issuer) may
enter into thereafter; provided, that the existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries (or such parent company) of obligations under any future amendment to any
such existing agreement or under any similar agreement entered into after the Completion Date or
such Qualified IPO shall only be permitted by this clause (8) to the extent that the terms of any such

or on the date of such Qualified IPO;

Transaction Expenses;

(10) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, contractors, joint venture partners or purchasers or

either (i) the encumbrances and restrictions are not materially more disadvantageous, taken
as a whole, to the Holders than is customary in comparable financings for similarly situated
issuers (as determined in good faith by the Issuer), (ii) the encumbrances and restrictions
are not materially more restrictive, taken as whole, with respect to such Restricted
Subsidiaries, than the restrictions or encumbrances (A) contained in the Indenture, the

modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or

with respect to such encumbrance and other restrictions taken as a whole than those prior
to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding,
replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock in
receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common
equity shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the subordination
of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans and advances made to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction
on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not permit any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and nonWholly Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries guarantee other capital markets debt securities
of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to clause (ii) below), other than a Subsidiary Guarantor, a Captive
Insurance Subsidiary, a Foreign Subsidiary, a direct or indirect Subsidiary that is a direct or indirect Domestic
Subsidiary or a direct or indirect Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC, a FSHCO Subsidiary or a Securitization Subsidiary,
to guarantee the payment of (i) the Senior Secured Credit Facilities incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph
under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or (ii)
capital market debt securities of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor in an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$100.0 million, unless:

(1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 60 days after the guarantee of such Indebtedness executes and
delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted
Subsidiary, except that with respect to a guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor, if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes
or such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with
respect to such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee
substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes; and


-----

(2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other applicable
rights against the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such
Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee;

_provided that this covenant shall not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that existed_
at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation
of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary
that is not otherwise required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor to become a Subsidiary Guarantor, in which case such
Subsidiary shall not be required to comply with the 60 day period described in clause (1) above.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will have its annual consolidated financial statements audited
by a nationally recognized firm of independent auditors. In addition, after the Completion Date, so long as any Notes
are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Holders of the Notes the following reports:

(1) (x) all annual and year-to-date interim period (ended at each quarter end, except for the fourth

“significant” at the 20% or greater level pursuant to clauses (1)(i) and (ii) of the definition of
“Significant Subsidiary” under Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X only), 4.01, 4.02(a) and (b), 5.01 and

principal financial officer and principal operating officer only and other than with respect to
information otherwise required or contemplated by subclause (3) of such Item or by Item 402 of
Regulation S-K) as in effect on the Completion Date if the Issuer were required to file such reports;

_provided, however, that (A) no such report will be required to include as an exhibit, or to include a summary_
of the terms of, any employment or compensatory arrangement, agreement, plan or understanding between the Issuer

any of its direct or indirect parent entities or its Subsidiaries), (B) the Issuer shall not be required to make available
any information regarding the occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (2) above if the Issuer determines in
its good faith judgment that the event that would otherwise be required to be disclosed is not material to the Holders

Subsidiaries taken as a whole, (C) no such report will be required to comply with Regulation G under the Exchange
Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K with respect to any “non-GAAP” financial information contained therein, (D) no
such report will be required to comply with Regulation S-X including, without limitation, Rules 3-03(e), 3-05, 3-09,

to provide any information that is not otherwise similar to information currently included in this offering
memorandum, (F) in no event will such reports be required to include as an exhibit copies of any agreements, financial
statements or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits under the SEC rules, (G) trade secrets and other
information that could cause competitive harm to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may be excluded from any

GAAP or IFRS and may be prepared using U.S. GAAP or IFRS as applicable to private companies and (J) no report
will be required to be provided in connection with the Transactions.


-----

All such annual reports shall be furnished within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate;
_provided that the annual report for the fiscal year ending on or about December 31, 2023 or any fiscal year in which_
either (A) the Issuer or any Subsidiary has consummated a material (in the good faith judgment of management of the
Issuer) acquisition or similar Investment or (B) a material (in the good faith judgment of management of the Issuer)
accounting change has occurred, shall be furnished within 150 days after the end of such fiscal year; provided that to
the extent the Issuer has a longer period to deliver annual reports in accordance with Section 6.01(a) of the Senior
Secured Credit Facilities, the Issuer shall be permitted to deliver such information within such longer period; all such
quarterly reports shall be furnished within 60 days after the end of the fiscal quarter to which they relate; provided
that the quarterly report for the fiscal quarters ending on or about June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023, March 31, 2024
and June 30, 2024 or any fiscal quarter in which either (A) the Issuer or any Subsidiary has consummated a material
(in the good faith judgment of management of the Issuer) acquisition or similar Investment or (B) a material (in the
good faith judgment of management of the Issuer) accounting change has occurred, shall be furnished within 75 days
after the end of the fiscal quarter which they relate; provided that to the extent the Issuer has a longer period to deliver
annual reports in accordance with Section 6.01(b) of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Issuer shall be permitted
to deliver such information within such longer period; and all such current reports shall be furnished within 15 days
of the due date specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for reporting companies under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any annual reports or quarterly reports may be furnished on or prior to the due date
applicable to the Issuer or any parent entity of the Issuer pursuant to the SEC’s rules and regulations under the
Exchange Act, if later than a date provided in the preceding sentence.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph
of this covenant if the Issuer or any parent entity of the Issuer has filed reports containing substantially such
information (or any such information of a parent entity pursuant to the fourth succeeding paragraph) with the SEC.

If the Issuer or any parent entity of the Issuer does not file reports containing such information with the SEC,
then the Issuer will make available such information and such reports to any Holder of the Notes and to any beneficial
owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information on a password-protected website or online data system
which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such information readily available to any bona
fide prospective investor, any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or any
market maker in the Notes who agrees to treat such information as confidential; provided that the Issuer shall post
such information thereon and make readily available any password or other login information to any such bona fide
prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker; provided, however, that the Issuer may deny access to any
information or reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this covenant to any such Holder, beneficial owner, bona
fide prospective investor, securities analyst or market maker that is a competitor or to the extent that the Issuer
determines in its sole discretion that the provision of such information to such Person may be harmful to the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries, its parent entities or the Investors; provided, further, that such Holders, beneficial owners, bona
fide prospective investors, securities analysts and market makers shall agree to (A) treat all such reports (and
information contained therein) as confidential, (B) not to use such reports (and the information contained therein) for
any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (C) not publicly disclose any such
reports (and the information contained therein).

To the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will furnish to Holders of the Notes, securities analysts
and prospective investors upon request the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under
the Securities Act.

If any Subsidiary of the Issuer is an Unrestricted Subsidiary and if any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group
of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of the
Issuer, then the Issuer should furnish the annual and quarterly information required by clause (1) of the first paragraph
of this covenant, which shall include a presentation of selected financial metrics (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) of
such Unrestricted Subsidiaries as a group in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant
with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to Parent or any
parent entity of the Issuer; provided that if Parent or such parent entity does not Guarantee the Notes then the same is


-----

accompanied by selected financial metrics that show the differences (in the Issuer’s sole discretion) between the
information relating to Parent or such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis, on the other hand.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuer will not be deemed to have failed to comply with
any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” until 180 days
after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder.

To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this section “—Reports
and Other Information” and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its
obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished or made available to it and the
Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained
therein or determinable therefrom, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee
is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to disclose any information or take any actions
that, in the good faith view of the Issuer, would violate applicable securities laws or the SEC’s “gun-jumping” rules.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal
of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to the Notes;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee
or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes to
comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in
clause (1) or (2) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes;

(4) (i) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which
there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such
Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of the Notes, if both:

(a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its
stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an
obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated
final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such
Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and

(b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other
such Indebtedness in default for failure to pay principal at stated final maturity (after giving
effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregate the greater of (i) $150.0 million (or its foreign currency equivalent) and (ii)
55.0% of LTM EBITDA or more outstanding;

(5) (i) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that
together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant


-----

Subsidiary) to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of the greater of (i) $150.0 million and (ii)
55.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of amounts covered by insurance policies issued by reputable
insurance companies), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a
period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is
covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such
judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary
(or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together (as of the latest consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other
Information”) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary);

(7) the Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of
Subsidiary Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer
for a fiscal quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or be
declared null and void or any responsible officer of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a
Significant Subsidiary (or the responsible officers of any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that
together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end
provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information”) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary), as the case may be, denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee
or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the
release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture;

(8) (i) the Liens created by the Security Documents shall at any time not constitute a valid and perfected
Lien on any material portion of the Collateral intended to be covered thereby (unless perfection is
not required by the Indenture or the Security Documents) other than (A) in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Security Document and the Indenture, (B) the satisfaction in full of all
Obligations under the Indenture or (C) any loss of perfection that results from the failure of the
Controlling Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent or other applicable collateral agent to
maintain possession of certificates delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Security
Documents and (ii) such default continues for 30 days after receipt of written notice given by the
Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes;

(9) the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary (or any group of Subsidiary
Guarantors that together (as of the latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal
quarter end provided as required under “—Reports and Other Information” would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary) shall assert, in any pleading in any court of competent jurisdiction, that any
security interest in any Security Document is invalid or unenforceable (other than by reason of the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture and discharge of the Indenture, the release
of the Guarantor of such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or the
release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Security
Documents); and

(10) the failure by the Issuer to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption to the extent required,
as described under “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (6) above) occurs and is continuing under the
Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding
Notes may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then
outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately; provided that no such declaration may be made with respect to
any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior to such declaration. Any notice of
Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with
respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, instruction
to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this


-----

section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first
paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent to take any other action with
respect to an alleged Default or Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this
section (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each, a
“Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Issuer,
the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, that (i) such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is
DTC or DTC’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short and
(ii) such Holder and the Affiliates of such Holder do not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, that
such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners and Affiliates of such beneficial owners that do not) hold
or beneficially own Notes in excess of the Voting Cap (each, a “Position Representation”), which representation, in
the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing
representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In
addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the
Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a
“Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, any Position Representation
or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or
DTC’s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification
Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the
Issuer has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in
breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of
competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their
Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder
Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect
to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to
the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable,
shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the
Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders
have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification
Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure
period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of
the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being
disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining
Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder
Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered
or provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed
never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if
applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or
Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future
Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification
Covenant, then the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with
such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to
achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the
Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder
Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). Each of the Trustee and
the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate
delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements
made therein.


-----

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a
bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. Each Holder by
accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent (nor any agent)
shall be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any
Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee or the Notes
Collateral Agent, if applicable, may determine in its sole discretion. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent
shall have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position,
(ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action
to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant,
(v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default
or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or
determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short
Derivative Instrument or otherwise.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first
paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium,
if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of
Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and
payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders
notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if
it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee may
on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture or
the Security Documents and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such
rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in
the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a non-consenting Holder).

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of
this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than
as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action
by the Trustee or the Holders, if after such Event of Default arose:

(1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged;

(2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action
(as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or

(3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will
be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any
of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes
Collateral Agent, if applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if
applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium
(if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a
Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing
and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph
of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant;


-----

(2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section,
Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant,
comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) Holders of the Notes have offered, and if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer
of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Required
Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available
to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow
any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights
of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action
that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes (it being understood that the Trustee
does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder).

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding
compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware of any
Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived
within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or
Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its
office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice
of Default.”

Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the
Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default giving rise to
such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this
paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may
(x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an
actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the
Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and
(y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Managers, Officers, Members, Partners, Employees and Equityholders**

No past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or direct or
indirect equityholder of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiaries or of any of their direct or indirect parent companies
(other than in such equityholder’s capacity as the Issuer or a Guarantor) shall have any liability, for any obligations of
the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Guarantees, the Indenture or the Security Documents or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting Notes waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and the
Security Documents, as the case may be, will terminate (other than certain obligations) and will be released upon
payment in full of all of the Notes. The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations


-----

discharged with respect to the Notes and have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee
(“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default except for:

(1) the rights of Holders of Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes when such payments are due solely out of the trust created pursuant to the
Indenture;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of
such Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Issuer’s obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and those of each
Guarantor released with respect to substantially all of the restrictive covenants that are described in the Indenture
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default
or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including
bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and insolvency events pertaining to the Issuer) described under “—Events of
Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Notes:

(1) the Issuer shall irrevocably deposit with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the Issuer
for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S.
Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amount as will be sufficient, in the opinion
of an Independent Financial Advisor, without consideration of any reinvestment to pay the principal
of, premium, if any, and interest due on such Notes on the stated maturity date or on the redemption
date, as the case may be, of such principal, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes and the Issuer
must specify whether such Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;
_provided,_ that upon any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the
amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the Indenture to the extent that an amount is
deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the Issuer for this purpose) equal to
the Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of
the date of redemption (any such amount, the “Applicable Premium Deficit”) only required to be
deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity designated by the Issuer for this purpose) on or prior
to the date of redemption. Any Applicable Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least one Business Day prior to the date of the deposit of such
Applicable Premium Deficit that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied
toward such redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions,

(a) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or

(b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law,

in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax


-----

on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance
had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel confirming that, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, the beneficial owners
of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance
had not occurred;

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which
the Issuer or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Issuer or any Guarantor is bound (other than
that resulting from any borrowing of funds to be applied to make the deposit required to effect such
Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance and any similar and simultaneous deposit relating to
other Indebtedness, and, in each case, the granting of Liens in connection therewith);

(5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of
the Issuer or any Guarantor or others; and

(6) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
(which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes (other than certain rights
of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent and the Issuer’s obligations with respect thereto), when either:

(1) all Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have
been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust,
have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(2) (a) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise, will become due
and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the
Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer, and the Issuer have or any Guarantor
has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity
designated by the Issuer for this purpose) as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the
Holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Securities, or a combination
thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment to
pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the
Trustee for cancellation for principal, premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of
maturity or redemption; provided, that upon any redemption that requires the payment of
the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the
Indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the Trustee (or such other entity
designated by the Issuer for this purpose) equal to the Applicable Premium calculated as
of the date of the notice of redemption, with any Applicable Premium Deficit only required
to be deposited with the Trustee on or prior to the date of redemption. Any Applicable
Premium Deficit shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee at
least one Business Day prior to the date of the deposit of such Applicable Premium Deficit
that confirms that such Applicable Premium Deficit shall be applied toward such
redemption;


-----

(b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and

(c) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee (or such other entity
designated by the Issuer for this purpose) to apply the deposited money toward the payment
of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, (i) the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Notes and
the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the Required Holders (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and (ii) any existing
Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if
any, or interest on the Notes (which shall be considered waived only with respect to Notes held by consenting Holders),
except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of
the Indenture, any Guarantee, the Notes or the Security Documents may be waived with the consent of the Required
Holders (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the
Notes).

Notwithstanding anything in this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section, the “Events of Default and
Remedies” section, the definition of “Required Holders” or otherwise in the Indenture to the contrary, for purposes of
determining whether the Required Holders have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment, modification,
waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the
Security Documents or any departure by the Issuer or any Guarantor therefrom, unless the action in question affects
any Affiliated Holder in a disproportionately adverse manner than its effect on the other Holders, or any plan of
reorganization pursuant to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, (ii) otherwise acted on any
matter related to the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees or (iii) directed or required the
Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent or any Holder to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with
respect to or under the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees, no Affiliated Holder shall
have any right to consent (or not consent), otherwise act or direct or require the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent
or any Holder to take (or refrain from taking) any such action and all Notes held by any Affiliated Holders shall be
deemed to be not outstanding for all purposes of calculating whether the Required Holders have taken any actions.

Notwithstanding anything in this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section, the “Events of Default and
Remedies” section, the definition of “Required Holders” or otherwise in the Indenture to the contrary, for purposes of
determining whether the Required Holders have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment, modification,
waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the
Security Documents or any departure by the Issuer or any Guarantor therefrom, (ii) otherwise acted on any matter
related to the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents or (iii) directed or required the Trustee,
the Notes Collateral Agent or any Holder to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to
or under the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents or the Guarantees, all Notes held or beneficially owned by
Debt Fund Affiliates may not account for more than 49.9% (pro rata among such Debt Fund Affiliates) of the Notes
of consenting Holders included in determining whether the Required Holders have consented to any action pursuant
to this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” section, the “Events
of Default and Remedies” section, the definition of “Required Holders” or otherwise in the Indenture, for purposes of
determining whether the Required Holders or any of the Holders, as applicable, have (i) consented (or not consented)
to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of the Indenture, the
Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents or any departure by the Issuer or any Guarantor therefrom, (ii)
otherwise acted on any matter related to the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents or (iii)
directed or required the Trustee or any Holder to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect
to or under the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents, all Notes held or beneficially owned
by any Holder (or beneficial owner) or any Affiliate of such Holder (or beneficial owner), shall not, subject to the


-----

proviso to this paragraph below, account for more than 20.0% of the Notes outstanding at any time (with respect to
any Holder (or beneficial owner) (collectively with any Affiliates of such Holder (or beneficial owner)), the “Voting
**_Cap”) included in determining whether the Required Holders or any of the Holders, as applicable, have consented to_**
any action (or refrained from taking any action) or provided any consent or waiver pursuant to this “Amendment,
Supplement and Waiver” section. All Notes held or beneficially owned by any Holder (or beneficial owner) or any
Affiliate of such Holder (or beneficial owner) in excess of the Voting Cap shall be deemed to not be outstanding for
all purposes of calculating whether the Required Holders, or with respect to any other action which requires the consent
of the Holders, the Holders, as applicable, have taken any action (or refrained from taking any action) or provided any
consent or waiver; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, consent to an
increase of the Voting Cap for any individual Holder (or beneficial owner) (collectively with any Affiliates of such
Holder (or beneficial owner)) from time to time, which increase shall become effective with respect to the Voting Cap
solely for such Holder (or beneficial owner) (collectively with any Affiliates of such Holder (or beneficial owner))
(and not, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Voting Cap for any other Holder (or beneficial owner) or the
Affiliates of any other Holder (or beneficial owner)) upon written notice to the Trustee.

In connection with any action under the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees or the Security Documents that
requires a determination of whether the Required Holders or any of the Holders, as applicable, have consented to such
action or otherwise acted on any matter or directed the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent to undertake any action
(or refrain from taking any action), the Issuer shall identify the amount of Notes held or beneficially owned by an
Affiliated Holder or a Debt Fund Affiliate, the amount of the Voting Cap and whether the Voting Cap is triggered
with respect to such consent, action or direction in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee and Notes Collateral
Agent, upon which the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely without investigation.

The Indenture will provide that, without the consent of each affected Holder of a Note (including, for
purposes of this paragraph, Notes held or beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates), an amendment or waiver
may not, with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed final maturity of any such Note or alter or waive the
provisions with respect to the redemption of such Notes (other than provisions relating to (a) notice
periods (to the extent consistent with applicable requirements of clearing and settlement systems)
for redemption and conditions to redemption (including the timing of the Outside Date and
conditions relating to the Special Mandatory Redemption) and (b) the covenants described above
under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any such Note (other than provisions
relating to the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders”);

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on
such Notes, except a rescission of acceleration of such Notes by the Required Holders, and a waiver
of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration, or in respect of a covenant or provision
contained in the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee which cannot be amended or modified
without the consent of each affected Holder;

(5) make any such Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults;

(7) make any change in these amendment and waiver provisions;


-----

(8) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture or the Notes of any Holder to institute
suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes on or after the
due dates therefor;

(9) make any change to or modify the ranking of such Notes that would adversely affect the Holders;
or

(10) except as expressly permitted by the Indenture, modify the Guarantees of any Subsidiary Guarantor
that is a Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Subsidiary Guarantors that, taken together (as of the
latest consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for a fiscal quarter end provided as required
under “—Reports and Other Information”), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, in any manner
materially adverse to the Holders of such Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding, no amendment or waiver may make any change in any Security Document or
the provisions in the Indenture dealing with Collateral or application of trust proceeds of the Collateral with the effect
of releasing the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral which secure the Obligations in respect of the Notes,
other than as provided under the terms of the Indenture or the Security Documents.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee, the Indenture or the
Security Documents to which it is a party), the Trustee and/or the Notes Collateral Agent (and any other agents party
thereto (to the extent applicable)), as the case may be, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, any
Guarantee or the Security Documents without the consent of any Holder:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of assets;

(4) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to the Holders;

(5) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not materially adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any such Holder;

(6) to add or modify covenants for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power conferred
upon the Issuer or any Guarantor;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture of a successor
Trustee, a successor Notes Collateral Agent or a successor paying agent thereunder (or any other
applicable agent) pursuant to the requirements thereof;

(9) to add an obligor or a Guarantor under the Indenture;

(10) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantees or the Security Documents to any
provision of this “Description of Notes”;

(11) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation to facilitate the issuance and
administration of the Notes; _provided, however, that such amendment does not materially and_
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Notes;


-----

(12) to release any Guarantor from its Guarantee pursuant to the Indenture when permitted or required
by the Indenture;

(13) to release and discharge any Lien securing the Notes when permitted or required by the Indenture
or the Security Documents;

(14) to comply with the rules of any applicable securities depositary;

(15) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant any other Lien in favor of the Trustee or the Notes
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Holders, as additional security for the payment and
performance of all or any portion of the Equal Priority Obligations, in any property or assets,
including any which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Lien is
required to be granted to or for the benefit of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent pursuant to
the Indenture, any of the Security Documents or otherwise;

(16) to add Additional Equal Priority Secured Parties to any Security Documents;

(17) (A) to enter into any intercreditor agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the
Holders as those set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, taken as a whole, or any
joinder thereto, (B) to enter into the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or any intercreditor
agreement having substantially similar terms with respect to the Holders as those set forth in the
Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, taken as a whole, or any joinder thereto or (C) to enter into
any amendment or supplement to any intercreditor agreement to add other debt representatives as
party thereto and to make such other changes to the applicable intercreditor agreement, as in the
good faith determination of the Issuer, are required to effectuate the foregoing;

(18) in the case of any Security Document, to include therein any legend required to be set forth therein
pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or any other intercreditor agreement or to
modify any such legend as required by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or any other
intercreditor agreement; and

(19) to provide for the succession of any parties to the Security Documents (and other amendments that
are administrative or ministerial in nature) in connection with an amendment, renewal, extension,
substitution, refinancing, restructuring, replacement, supplementing or other modification from time
to time of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any other agreement that is not prohibited by the
Indenture.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of any of the covenants described under, “—
Repurchase at the option of Holders” or “—Certain Covenants,” or action taken in compliance with the covenants in
effect at the time of such action, shall be deemed to impair or affect any legal rights of any Holders of the Notes to
receive payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or to institute suit for the enforcement of
any payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication (including posting of information as contemplated by the covenant described
under “Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) will be deemed given on the first date on which
publication is made and notices given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days
after mailing or transmitting. Notices sent by overnight delivery service will be deemed given when delivered and
notices given electronically will be deemed given when sent. Notice otherwise given in accordance with the procedures
of DTC will be deemed given on the date sent to DTC.


-----

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer or a Guarantor, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property
received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the Required Holders will have the right to direct the time, method and place
of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent,
subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall occur (which shall not
be cured) of which the Trustee has received written notice or a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge,
the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct
of his own affairs. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of
its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of the Notes, unless such Holder shall have
offered, and if requested, provided, to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, security and indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and any Guarantee will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York.

**Certain Definitions**

Set forth below are certain defined terms used in the Indenture. For purposes of the Indenture, unless
otherwise specifically indicated, the term “consolidated” with respect to any Person refers to such Person consolidated
with its Restricted Subsidiaries.

“Acquired Indebtedness” means, with respect to any specified Person,

(1) Indebtedness of any other Person existing at the time such other Person is merged, consolidated or
amalgamated with or into or became a Restricted Subsidiary of such specified Person, including
Indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with, or in contemplation of, such other Person
merging, consolidating or amalgamating with or into or becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of such
specified Person, and

(2) Indebtedness secured by a Lien encumbering any asset acquired by such specified Person.

“Acquisition” means the transactions directly or indirectly related to or contemplated pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.

“Acquisition Date” means the date of consummation of the Acquisition.

“Additional Equal Priority Obligations” means any Indebtedness having, and which is permitted by each
Equal Priority Document to have, Equal Lien Priority relative to the Notes with respect to the Collateral; provided that
an authorized representative of the holders of such Indebtedness shall have executed a joinder to the Equal Priority
Intercreditor Agreement.

“Additional Equal Priority Secured Parties” means the holders of any Additional Equal Priority Obligations
and any trustee, authorized representative or agent of such Additional Equal Priority Obligations.

“Affiliate” of any specified Person means any other Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by
or under direct or indirect common control with such specified Person. No Person shall be an “Affiliate” of the Issuer
or any Subsidiary solely because it is an unrelated portfolio operating company of an Investor. For purposes of this
definition, “control” (including, with correlative meanings, the terms “controlling”, “controlled by” and “under


-----

**_common control with”), as used with respect to any Person, shall mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of the_**
power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of such Person, whether through the ownership
of voting securities, by agreement or otherwise.

“Affiliated Holder” means, at any time, any Holder that is a direct or indirect holding company of Parent or
an Investor (including portfolio companies of the Investors notwithstanding the exclusion in the definition of
“Investors”) (other than Parent, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries and other than any Debt Fund Affiliate) or a NonDebt Fund Affiliate of an Investor at such time.

“Applicable Asset Sale Percentage” means, (1) 100.0%, if the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be greater than 3.75 to 1.00 for the Issuer’s most recently ended four full
fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of the applicable
Asset Sale, (2) 50.0%, if the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall
be less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.00 and greater than 3.25 to 1.00 for the Issuer’s most recently ended four full fiscal
quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of the applicable Asset
Sale and (3) 0.0%, if the Consolidated Equal Priority Debt Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be
less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.00 for the Issuer’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date of the applicable Asset Sale and in each case
calculated after giving pro forma effect to such Asset Sale and any related prepayment; provided, that, for the

“Consolidated Equal Priority Net Debt” means Consolidated Total Indebtedness minus, without duplication,
the sum of (i) the portion of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary included in Consolidated Total
Indebtedness that is not secured, in whole or in part, by any Lien on the Collateral and (ii) the portion of Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary included in Consolidated Total Indebtedness that is expressly subordinated
in right of payment to, or that is secured on a junior lien basis to the Liens securing, the Equal Priority Notes
Obligations.

“Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the ratio of
EBITDA of such Person for such period to the Consolidated Interest Expense of such Person for such period. In the
event that such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs, assumes, guarantees, redeems, repays, retires or
extinguishes any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness incurred under any revolving credit, working capital or letter
of credit facility) or issues or redeems Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock subsequent to the commencement of the
period for which the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is being calculated but prior to or substantially concurrently
with the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is made (the “Consolidated
**_Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving_**
pro forma effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, redemption, repayment, retirement or extinguishment of
Indebtedness, or such issuance or redemption of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, including a pro
forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable fourquarter period, subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the paragraphs contained in “—Certain Covenants—Certain
Compliance Calculations”; provided, however, that the pro forma calculation of Consolidated Interest Expense for
purposes of the first paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance
of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” (and for the purposes of other provisions of the Indenture that refer to such
first paragraph) shall not give effect to any Indebtedness being incurred on such date (or on such other subsequent
date which would otherwise require pro forma effect to be given to such incurrence) pursuant to the second paragraph
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock” (other than Secured Indebtedness incurred pursuant to subclause (2) of the proviso to clause (14)
thereof).

For purposes of making the computation referred to above, Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations (as determined in accordance with GAAP), operational
changes, Business Expansions, new or revised contracts and other transactions that have been made by or involving
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference
period and on or prior to or substantially concurrently with the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation Date
shall be calculated on a _pro forma_ basis assuming that all such Investments, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers,
amalgamations, consolidations, discontinued operations, operational changes, Business Expansions, new or revised
contracts and other transactions (and the change in any associated fixed charge obligations and the change in EBITDA
resulting therefrom) had occurred on the first day of the four-quarter reference period; provided that at the election of
the Issuer, such pro forma adjustments shall not be required to be determined to the extent the aggregate consideration
paid in connection with such acquisition or other transaction was less than $100.0 million. If since the beginning of


-----

such period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated
with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational
change, Business Expansion or other transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then
the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational
change, Business Expansion, new or revised contract or other transaction had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever _pro forma_ effect is to be given to an Investment, acquisition,
disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued operation, operational change, Business Expansion,
new or revised contract or other transaction (including the Transactions), the pro forma calculations shall be made in
good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries (and may include,
for the avoidance of doubt, cost savings, operating expense reductions and product margin, and other synergies
resulting from such Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, discontinued
operation, operational change, Business Expansion, new or revised contract or other transaction (including the
Transactions) which is being given pro forma effect) calculated in accordance with and permitted by clauses (1)(h)
and (1)(o) of the definition of “EBITDA.” If any Indebtedness bears a floating or formula rate of interest and is being
given pro forma effect, the interest on such Indebtedness shall be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Consolidated
Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any
Hedging Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness). Interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be deemed to
accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the
rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation in accordance with GAAP. For purposes of making the
computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed on a pro forma
basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the applicable period except
as set forth in the first paragraph of this definition. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined at an
interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or other rate, shall
be deemed to have been based upon the rate actually chosen, or, if none, then based upon such optional rate chosen as
the Issuer may designate.

“Consolidated Interest Expense” means, with respect to any Person for any period, without duplication, the
sum of:

(1) consolidated cash interest expense of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period
with respect to all outstanding Indebtedness to the extent included in the calculation of Consolidated
Total Indebtedness, to the extent such expense was deducted (and not added back) in computing
Consolidated Net Income (including (a) amortization of original issue discount resulting from the
issuance of Indebtedness at less than par, (b) all commissions, discounts and other fees and charges
owed with respect to letters of credit or bankers acceptances, (c) [reserved], (d) the interest
component of Financing Lease Obligations, and (e) net payments, if any made (less net payments,
if any, received), pursuant to interest rate Hedging Obligations with respect to Indebtedness, and
excluding (o) annual agency or similar fees paid to the administrative agents, collateral agents and
other agents under any Credit Facilities, (p) any additional interest with respect to failure to comply
with any registration rights agreement owing with respect to any securities, (q) costs associated with
obtaining Hedging Obligations, (r) any expense resulting from the discounting of any Indebtedness
in connection with the application of recapitalization accounting or, if applicable, purchase or
acquisition accounting in connection with the Transactions, any acquisition or other transaction, (s)
penalties and interest relating to taxes, (t) any “additional interest” or “liquidated damages” with
respect to other securities for failure to timely comply with registration rights obligations, (u)
amortization or expensing of deferred financing fees, amendment and consent fees, debt issuance
costs, commissions, fees, expenses and discounted liabilities and any other amounts of non-cash
interest, (v) any expensing of bridge, commitment and other financing fees and any other fees related
to the Transactions, any acquisitions after the Completion Date or other transaction, (w)
Securitization Fees, commissions, discounts, yield, make-whole premium and other fees and
charges (including any interest expense) incurred in connection with any Qualified Securitization
Facility, (x) any accretion of accrued interest on discounted liabilities and any prepayment, make

resulting from push-down accounting and (z) any lease, rental or other expense in connection with
a Non-Financing Lease Obligation); plus

(2) consolidated cash interest of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period, whether
paid or accrued (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt, any paid-in-kind interest, and excluding
any interest capitalized, accrued, accreted or paid in respect of Subordinated Shareholder Funding);
less

(3) interest income of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period.

For purposes of this definition, interest on a Financing Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an
interest rate reasonably determined by such Person to be the rate of interest implicit in such Financing Lease Obligation
in accordance with GAAP (or, if not implicit, as otherwise determined in accordance with GAAP).

“Consolidated Net Income” means, with respect to any Person for any period, the aggregate of the Net
Income of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period, on a consolidated basis, and otherwise
determined in accordance with GAAP; provided that, without duplication:

losses or expenses (including all fees and expenses relating thereto) (including any extraordinary,
exceptional, one-time, infrequent, non-operating, unusual or nonrecurring operating expenses

respect of any extraordinary, exceptional, infrequent, unusual or nonrecurring items, charges or

(5) the Net Income for such period of any Person that is not a Subsidiary, or is an Unrestricted

Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the
“Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC
only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership
interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect
Participants.

DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it:

(1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, DTC
will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the
principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes;
and

(2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of
these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the
Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of
beneficial interests in Global Notes).

Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein
directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein
indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in a
Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must
initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or
indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but
not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system
other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, NA., as operator
of Clearstream, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the
books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and
requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require
that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer
beneficial interests in a Global Note to persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent.
Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of
a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to persons that do not participate in the
DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate
evidencing those interests.

Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their
names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and
will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose.

Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the
name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture. Under
the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose names notes, including Global
Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records
relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or


-----

(2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect
Participants.

DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the
notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the
payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant
Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount
of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to
the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the
responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or
the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying
the beneficial owners of any notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in
relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes.

Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in
DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers
between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and
operating procedures.

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market
transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will
be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be,
by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and
procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case
may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to
take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from
DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement
applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the
depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the direction
of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect
of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or
have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants.
Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may
discontinue or change those procedures at any time.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes**

Prior to any exchange of any beneficial interest in a Regulation S Temporary Global Note for a beneficial
interest in a Regulation S Permanent Global Note:

    - the holder of the beneficial interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note must provide Euroclear
or Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the indenture that will
govern the notes certifying that the beneficial owner of the interest in the Regulation S Temporary Global
Note is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that has purchased that interest in a transaction that is
exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act; and


-----

    - Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the Trustee (or the paying agent if other
than the Trustee) a certificate in the form required by the indenture that will govern the notes.

**Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes**

A Global Note is exchangeable for a Certificated Note if:

    - DTC (a) notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the applicable Global
Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and, in each case, a
successor depositary is not appointed;

    - we, at our option, notify the Trustee in writing that we elect to cause the issuance of Certificated Notes
(although Regulation S Temporary Global Notes at the Issuer’s election pursuant to this clause may not
be exchanged for Certificated Notes prior to (a) the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period
and (b) the receipt of any certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S); or

    - there has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default with respect to the notes.

In addition, beneficial interests in a Global Note may be exchanged for Certificated Notes upon prior written
notice given to the Trustee by or on behalf of DTC in accordance with the indenture. In all cases, Certificated Notes
delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in a Global Note will be registered in the names, and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of the depositary (in accordance with its customary
procedures) and will bear the applicable restrictive legend referred to in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is
not required by applicable law.

**Exchange of Certificated Notes for Global Notes**

If Certificated Notes are issued in the future, they will not be exchangeable for beneficial interests in any
Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided
in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to the
notes being transferred. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Exchanges Among Global Notes**

Beneficial interests in a Regulation S Temporary Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a
Regulation S Permanent Global Note only after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period and then only
upon provision of the certification described above under “— Certifications by Holders of the Regulation S Temporary
Global Notes.”

Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global
Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note only if:

    - the exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

    - the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
indenture) to the effect that the notes are being transferred:

    - to a person who (i) the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the
meaning of Rule 144A and (ii) is purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional
buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

    - in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Distribution


-----

Compliance Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Issuer and the Trustee a written certificate (in the form
provided in the indenture) to the effect that the transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of
Regulation S.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between a Regulation S Global Note and a Rule 144A
Global Note will be effected in DTC by means of an instruction originated by the DTC Participant through the DTC
Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect the changes in the principal amounts of the Regulation S Global Note and the Rule 144A Global
Note, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in the original Global
Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interest in the other Global Note. The policies and practices
of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Temporary Global Note prior to the expiration
of the Distribution Compliance Period.

**Same Day Settlement and Payment**

We will make payments in respect of notes represented by Global Notes, including payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by DTC or its
nominee. We will make all payments of principal of and premium, if any, and interest on Certificated Notes by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Holders of the Certificated Notes or, if no
account is specified, by mailing a check to each Holder’s registered address. Notes represented by Global Notes are
expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market
trading activity in notes represented by Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in immediately
available funds. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to
the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a
business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has advised us
that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear
or Clearstream participant to a Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be
available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or
Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the notes as of the date hereof, but it does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the
potential tax considerations.

This summary deals only with notes that are held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (generally, property held for investment) by persons who
purchase the notes for cash upon original issuance at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount
of the notes is sold for cash to investors, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriter, placement agent or wholesaler), and does not represent a detailed description of
the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the
United States federal income tax laws, including if you are:

    - a dealer or broker in securities or currencies;

    - a financial institution;

    - a regulated investment company;

    - a real estate investment trust;

    - a tax-exempt organization;

    - an insurance company;

    - a person holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, conversion or constructive sale transaction or
a straddle;

    - a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;

    - a person liable for alternative minimum tax;

    - a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes (or an investor
in such an entity);

    - a United States Holder (as defined below) whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

    - a “controlled foreign corporation”;

    - a “passive foreign investment company”;

    - a person required to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income with respect to the notes as
a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement; or

    - a United States expatriate.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code, and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the
date hereof. Those authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as
to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not
sought and do not intend to seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with this summary or that a court would not sustain
any challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.


-----

If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes) holds the notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partnership or a partner of a partnership considering an investment in the
notes, you should consult your tax advisors.

This discussion does not contain a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax
consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare contribution tax on
net investment income, United States federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax (including estate and
gift tax laws), or the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase of
**notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax**
**consequences to you of the ownership of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under other United**
**States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**Effects of Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances (see, for example, “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption,” “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control,” we may
be required to redeem or repurchase the notes significantly earlier than their scheduled maturity date and/or to pay
amounts in excess of stated interest and principal on the notes. The foregoing contingencies may implicate the
provisions of the United States Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” However, we
believe and intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the notes to be subject to the
contingent payment debt instrument rules. Our position is binding on you unless you disclose that you are taking a
contrary position in the manner required by applicable United States Treasury regulations. However, the position is
not binding on the IRS. If the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, you might be required to, among other
things, accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the notes, and to treat as ordinary income
(rather than capital gain) any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of a note. The remainder of this discussion
assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Holders are urged to consult their
tax advisors regarding the potential application to the notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the
consequences thereof.

**Consequences to United States Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you
if you are a United States Holder.

As used herein, “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is, for United States federal
income tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source;
or

    - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid
election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States
person.


-----

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the issue price of the notes will be equal to the stated
principal amount or, if the issue price is less than the stated principal amount, the difference will be a de minimis
amount (as set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations). Accordingly, stated interest on a note will generally be
taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your method of accounting for
United States federal income tax purposes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, you generally will
recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount you realize upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less an amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest,
which will be taxable as interest income to the extent not previously included in income) and your adjusted tax basis
in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note will generally be your cost for that note. Any gain or loss you recognize
will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the note for
more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate United States Holders (including individuals) are
eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**Consequences to Non-United States Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you
if you are a Non-United States Holder. “Non-United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes (other than
an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not a United
States Holder.

**_United States Federal Withholding Tax_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, United States federal income or
withholding tax will not apply to any payment of interest on the notes under the “portfolio interest rule,” provided
that:

    - interest paid on the notes is not effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the
United States (or, in the case of an income tax treaty resident, is not attributable to your permanent
establishment in the United States);

    - you do not actually or constructively own 10% or more of our capital or profits interest within the
meaning of the Code and applicable United States Treasury regulations;

    - you are not a controlled foreign corporation that is actually or constructively related to us through stock
ownership;

    - you are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code; and

    - either (a) you provide your name and address on an applicable IRS Form W-8, and certify, under
penalties of perjury, that you are not a United States person as defined under the Code or (b) you hold
your notes through certain foreign intermediaries and satisfy the certification requirements of applicable
United States Treasury regulations. Special certification rules apply to Non-United States Holders that
are pass-through entities rather than corporations or individuals.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to you will be subject to
a 30% United States federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly
executed:


-----

    - IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable form) claiming an exemption from or
reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty; or

    - IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form) certifying that interest paid on the notes is not subject to
withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to your permanent
establishment in the United States) (as discussed below under “—United States Federal Income Tax”).

The 30% United States federal withholding tax generally will not apply to any payment of principal or gain
that you realize on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note, except with respect
to accrued and unpaid interest. If you are eligible for an exemption from or reduced rate of United States federal
withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty, you may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by
timely filing an appropriate claim with the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding your entitlement
to benefits under an applicable income tax treaty and the requirements for claiming any such benefits.

**_United States Federal Income Tax_**

If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on the notes is effectively connected
with the conduct of that trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to your
United States permanent establishment), then you will be subject to United States federal income tax on that interest
on a net income basis in the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code. In addition,
if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or lower applicable income
tax treaty rate) of your effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to adjustments. Any effectively connected
interest will be exempt from the 30% United States federal withholding tax, provided the certification requirements
discussed above in “—United States Federal Withholding Tax” are satisfied.

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding below, and except with respect to accrued and unpaid interest
(which will be treated as described above under “—United States Federal Withholding Tax”), any gain realized on
the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note generally will not be subject to United States
federal income tax unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to your United States permanent
establishment), in which case such gain will generally be subject to United States federal income tax
(and possibly branch profits tax) in the same manner as effectively connected interest as described above;
or

    - you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that
disposition and certain other conditions are met, in which case, unless an applicable income tax treaty
provides otherwise, you will generally be subject to a 30% United States federal income tax on any gain
recognized, which may be offset by certain of your United States source losses, if any.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_United States Holders_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest and principal on a note and
the proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of a note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient. A
backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a taxpayer identification number or a
certification of exempt status, or if you fail to report in full dividend and interest income.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.


-----

**_Non-United States Holders_**

Interest paid to you and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments generally will be
reported to the IRS and you. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or
eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and
any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside under the
provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement with those tax authorities.

In general, you will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments on the notes that we make
to you provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are
a United States person as defined under the Code, and such withholding agent has received from you the statement
described above in the fifth bullet point under “Consequences to Non-United States Holders—United States Federal
Withholding Tax.”

Information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding will apply to the proceeds
of a sale or other taxable disposition of notes made within the United States or conducted through certain United
States-related financial intermediaries, unless you certify to the payor under penalties of perjury that you are a NonUnited States Holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States
person as defined under the Code), or you otherwise establish an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, if any, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Additional Withholding Requirements**

Under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (such Sections and the United States Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder, collectively, commonly referred to as “FATCA”), a 30% United States federal withholding
tax may apply to any interest income paid on the notes to (i) a “foreign financial institution” (as specifically defined
in the Code and regardless of whether such foreign financial institution is the beneficial owner or an intermediary)
which does not provide sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an
exemption from FATCA, or (y) its compliance (or deemed compliance) with FATCA (which may alternatively be in
the form of compliance with an intergovernmental agreement with the United States) in a manner which avoids
withholding, or (ii) a “non-financial foreign entity” (as specifically defined in the Code) which does not provide
sufficient documentation, typically on IRS Form W-8BEN-E, evidencing either (x) an exemption from FATCA, or
(y) adequate information regarding certain substantial United States beneficial owners of such entity (if any). If an
interest payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above
under “Consequences to Non-United States Holders—United States Federal Withholding Tax,” an applicable
withholding agent may credit the withholding under FATCA against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding
tax. While withholding under FATCA would also have applied to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other
taxable disposition of the notes, proposed United States Treasury regulations (upon which taxpayers may rely until
final regulations are issued) eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds (other than amounts treated
as interest) entirely. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding these rules and whether they may be relevant
to your purchase, ownership and disposition of the notes.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the notes
by (i) “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of Section 3 (3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) that are subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) plans, individual retirement accounts and
other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)
or provisions under any other U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state, local or other laws or regulations that are similar to such
provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”) and (iii) entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include the assets of any of the foregoing described in clauses (i) and (ii), pursuant to ERISA or
otherwise (each of the foregoing described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) referred to herein as a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (a “Covered Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of a
Covered Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any
discretionary authority or control over the administration of such a Covered Plan or the management or disposition of
the assets of such a Covered Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Covered
Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Covered Plan.

In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA,
the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Covered Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
Section 3(14) of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an
exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary
of the Covered Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and/or the Code.

The purchase and/or holding of the notes by a Covered Plan with respect to which the Issuer, a Sponsor, a
guarantor, an initial purchaser, the Trustee or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”)
is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the notes are acquired and held in
accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S.
Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the purchase
and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance
company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In
addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer
of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control
or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Covered Plan involved in the transaction and provided
further that the Covered Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. Each of
the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of Covered Plans
considering purchasing and/or holding the notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review
the exemption in consultation with its own legal advisors to assure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any
class exemption, statutory exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular


-----

transaction involving the notes, or that if an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular
transaction.

Plans that are governmental plans, certain church plans and non-U.S. plans, may not be subject to the
fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may
nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such Plans should consult with their legal advisors
regarding the potential consequences of an investment in the notes under any applicable Similar Laws before
purchasing or holding any notes.

Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing the assets of any
Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under
ERISA and the Code or a similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a note (or any interest therein), each purchaser and subsequent transferee will
be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or
transferee to purchase or hold the notes (or any interest therein) constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the purchase,
holding and subsequent disposition of the notes (or any interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any
applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it
is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing or holding the notes (or any interest
therein) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their legal advisors regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption
would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes (and any interest therein). Each purchaser and subsequent
transferee has exclusive responsibility for ensuring that its purchase and holding of the notes (and any interest therein)
does not violate the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code, or the provisions of
any applicable Similar Laws. Neither this discussion nor anything provided in this offering memorandum is, or is
intended to be, investment advice directed at any potential Plan purchasers, or at Plan purchasers generally, and such
purchasers of any notes should consult and rely on their own counsel and advisors as to whether such an investment
is suitable for the Plan. The sale of any notes to any Plan hereunder is in no respect a representation by any Transaction
Party that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or
any particular Plan, or that such investment is prudent or appropriate for Plans generally or any particular Plan.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC is acting as representative (the “Representative”) of each of the several initial
purchasers named below. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement among us and the
Representative of the several initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and each of the initial
purchasers has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from us, the principal amount of notes set forth opposite
its name below.

**Principal Amount of**

**Initial Purchasers** **Notes**

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ................................................................................................ $
UBS Securities LLC ............................................................................................................ $
Citizens Capital Markets, Inc. ............................................................................................. $
Fifth Third Securities, Inc. .................................................................................................. $
Blackstone Securities Partners L.P. ..................................................................................... $
**Total ............................................................................................................................** **$** **500,000,000**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the notes sold under the purchase agreement if any of these notes are
purchased. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the
non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be terminated. The offering of the
notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject
any order in whole or in part.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The representative has advised us that the initial purchasers propose initially to offer the notes at the offering
price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the offering price or any other
term of the offering may be changed. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain of their affiliates.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws.
Accordingly, the notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”
The initial purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities
Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and Regulation
S under the Securities Act. The initial purchasers will not offer or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably
believe to be QIBs or pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside of the United States within
the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act. In addition, until 40 days following the later of the
commencement or closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or
not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes
the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each
purchaser of the notes will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and agreements as
described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

**New Issue of Notes**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The notes will not be listed on any
national securities exchange or quoted on any automated dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain
of the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the notes after completion of the offering.
However, they are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without
any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the notes. In addition, our ability to make a market
in the notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements (including as a result of regulatory
developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 and its application to debt securities) applicable to the
marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the notes. If an active trading market for the


-----

notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded,
they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for
similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made to investors on or about    , 2023 which will be the
business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement cycle being referred to as T+     ).
Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are generally required to settle in two
business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to
trade notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the
fact that the notes initially settle in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder
should consult their advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

In the purchase agreement we have agreed that we will not and will not permit any of our subsidiaries, for a
period of 45 days after the date of this offering memorandum, without first obtaining the prior written consent of the
Representative, directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or establish an
open “put equivalent position” within the meaning of Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act, or otherwise dispose of or
transfer, or announce the offering of, or file any registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any of
our or any of our subsidiaries debt securities or securities exchangeable for or convertible into our or any of our
subsidiaries debt securities, except for the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the purchase agreement.

**Short Positions**

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell the notes in the open market.
These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve secondary market sale by the initial purchasers of a greater principal amount of notes than they are
required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in
the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be
downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who
purchase in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, any purchase by the initial purchasers to cover the syndicate short
sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline
in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise
exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. In addition, neither
we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that the representative will engage in these transactions
or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of Sales to European Economic Area Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as
amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2017/1129 (as
amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them


-----

available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This offering
memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold
or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (“UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii)
a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the
“FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available
to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has
been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK
Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering
memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

This document is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Some of the
initial purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other
commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the
future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. Furthermore, certain of the initial purchasers
and their respective affiliates have entered and may, from time to time, enter into arms-length transactions with us in
the ordinary course of their business.

For example, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are lenders, arrangers and/or
agents under the Existing Credit Facility. As such facility will be repaid in connection with the Transactions, the
lenders party thereto, including affiliates of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Citizens Capital Markets, Inc., and Fifth
Third Securities, Inc., will receive a portion of the net proceeds from the transactions contemplated by this offering
memorandum, including potentially from the notes offered hereby. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective
affiliates have committed to become arrangers, lenders or administrative agents under the New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, to be entered into in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and will receive customary fees
and expenses in connection therewith. For each of the New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Term Loan Facility,
Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., UBS Securities LLC, Citizens Bank, N.A. and Fifth Third Bank, National
Association have been hired to act as lead arrangers and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. has been hired to act as
administrative agent and collateral agent, and Blackstone Holdings Finance Co. L.L.C., an affiliate of Blackstone, has
been hired to act as a co-manager. See “Description of Other Financing Arrangements.”

Furthermore, Blackstone Securities Partners L.P., one of the initial purchasers, is also an affiliate of
Blackstone, one of the Sponsors of the Merger, and will receive customary initial purchaser discounts and
commissions. UBS Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC have acted as financial advisors to Blackstone
Management Partners L.L.C., an affiliate of Blackstone, in connection with the transaction and will receive a
customary fee.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)
and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such


-----

investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the
initial purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge, and certain of the initial
purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, such initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions
which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including
potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes
offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.
