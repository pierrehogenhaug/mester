Prior to an event, event organizers use our platform to identify the appropriate venue via CSN, our Hospitality Cloud product sold into hotels and venues; secure competitive proposals; diagram venue space to optimize the event layout; secure speakers; build an event website; market the event; conduct pre-event surveys; coordinate event logistics and produce broadcast-quality video content; automate expense approvals; and manage budgeting and costs through integrations with other enterprise systems. During the course of an event, our platform enables event marketers and planners to process registrations, check-in attendees, conduct sessions, broadcast sessions, facilitate networking appointments, capture leads and manage on-going communication with attendees via an event-specific mobile app. Following an event, exhibitors and sponsors can act on leads collected and scored via our platform and provide registrants with access to on-demand video content, while event organizers can leverage our platform to analyze registration, attendance, session data and survey responses to measure engagement, content effectiveness and overall event success. Our platform leverages specific engagement actions within our Event Cloud solution to generate an engagement score for each attendee. When this data is integrated with an organization’s customer relationship management (“CRM”) and marketing automation systems, it can boost existing lead scores and inform the optimal next action such as sales follow up and marketing nurture campaigns.

1609,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Business Overview,9.1.2,Hospitality Cloud,"Group business is a critical component of revenue and income for the hospitality industry. According to a hotel industry data provider, group business can account for approximately one-third of hotel room nights; events also have a high attach rate of ancillary revenue, including food and beverage, A/V and other equipment rental and transportation services. We believe that as the hospitality industry continues to recover from the significant impact of the pandemic, hoteliers and venues are actively seeking to drive group meeting business and are turning to digital marketing tools and supporting software solutions, to market, sell and manage their event space, services and sleeping rooms. ----- Our CSN solution is a vertical online marketplace that allows event organizers to seamlessly solicit, receive and manage multiple RFPs for event space (by connecting them directly to hotels and venues at no charge to the organizers). Our platform helps hotels find event organizers and win group business by enabling them to digitally showcase their event space and automate the RFP process, while also providing event organizers the tools needed to search, diligence, negotiate and contract with hotels for event space. CSN connects approximately 109,000 meeting and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our proprietary global database as of December 31, 2022. We believe the breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and extensiveness of its proprietary database makes CSN a highly differentiated platform and well positioned in the industry. We believe that CSN contains one of the world’s most extensive and accurate repositories of detailed meeting venue information, empowering event organizers to search for, and qualify, potential event sites. We also believe that our marketplace generates network effects that simultaneously increase the volume of requests for proposal (“RFPs”) submitted from event organizers and increase the number of hospitality professionals using our system to respond to RFPs. Our Hospitality Cloud also offers software solutions to hotels and venues that improve the group sales process and streamline collaboration between hoteliers and event organizers to design, manage and execute events. Our software solutions include, but are not limited to, lead scoring to prioritize group RFPs received via CSN, event diagramming to collaborate with event organizers on designing optimal and safe event layouts and viewing threedimensional renderings, room block management that allows hotels and planners to work in concert to efficiently manage guest room reservations and room blocks for events and enables event attendees to reserve hotel rooms, business transient solutions that simplify how hotels attract, manage and win corporate travel business and business intelligence solutions to benchmark against internal and targeted competitive metrics. We sell our platform primarily through a direct inside sales team. For our Event Cloud, our customers enter annual and multi-year subscriptions to utilize our cloud-based event marketing and management solutions. The amount of these sum-certain contracts is contractually committed upfront based on the expected aggregate number of registrants for all events across an organization’s Total Event Program in a given year. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers. For our Hospitality Cloud, hotels and venues enter into annual and multi-year contracts for group business marketing solutions and software. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 Hospitality Cloud customers. We employ a land-and-expand business model, where customers grow their spend with us over time. As our Event Cloud customers grow their Total Event Program by launching new types of events, running more events and attracting additional registrants to their events, their contracts are typically renewed at higher annual values. Additionally, customers purchasing our platform to replace certain homegrown or multiple disparate point solutions may initially purchase only one or a few of our solutions. As those customers recognize the value of an integrated platform, they typically expand their footprint over time. As of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our net dollar retention rate was 115.1%, 113.9% and 101.0%, respectively. The increase in our net dollar retention rate between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2023 is primarily due to the lessening impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and 2023 on both the Event and Hospitality Clouds, resulting in increased spend on products supporting in-person events, in addition to the continued adoption of Attendee Hub, our solution for ongoing attendee engagement and hybrid and virtual events. ----- Our resilient business model has yielded strong results across all economic cycles and market conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, during which the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a near-total pause on in-person events, and a shift to virtual formats, our revenue decreased only 12% due to our sum-certain pricing model and multiyear contracts, despite not having a product catering to virtual formats at the start of the pandemic. As the meetings and events industry continues its strong recovery from the pandemic, we have leveraged our comprehensive platform to extend our industry leading position and delivered strong financial results. For the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2023, the Company generated $659.4 million in revenue, representing 22.4% year-over-year growth, a Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA Margin of 33.6% and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Conversion of 73.0%.

We believe the breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and extensiveness of its proprietary database makes CSN a highly differentiated platform and well positioned in the industry. We believe that CSN contains one of the world\u2019s most extensive and accurate repositories of detailed meeting venue information, empowering event organizers to search for, and qualify, potential event sites. We also believe that our marketplace generates network effects that simultaneously increase the volume of requests for proposal (\u201cRFPs\u201d) submitted from event organizers and increase the number of hospitality professionals using our system to respond to RFPs. Our Hospitality Cloud also offers software solutions to hotels and venues that improve the group sales process and streamline collaboration between hoteliers and event organizers to design, manage and execute events. Our software solutions include, but are not limited to, lead scoring to prioritize group RFPs received via CSN, event diagramming to collaborate with event organizers on designing optimal and safe event layouts and viewing threedimensional renderings, room block management that allows hotels and planners to work in concert to efficiently manage guest room reservations and room blocks for events and enables event attendees to reserve hotel rooms, business transient solutions that simplify how hotels attract, manage and win corporate travel business and business intelligence solutions to benchmark against internal and targeted competitive metrics. We sell our platform primarily through a direct inside sales team. For our Event Cloud, our customers enter annual and multi-year subscriptions to utilize our cloud-based event marketing and management solutions. The amount of these sum-certain contracts is contractually committed upfront based on the expected aggregate number of registrants for all events across an organization\u2019s Total Event Program in a given year. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers. For our Hospitality Cloud, hotels and venues enter into annual and multi-year contracts for group business marketing solutions and software. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 Hospitality Cloud customers. We employ a land-and-expand business model, where customers grow their spend with us over time. As our Event Cloud customers grow their Total Event Program by launching new types of events, running more events and attracting additional registrants to their events, their contracts are typically renewed at higher annual values. Additionally, customers purchasing our platform to replace certain homegrown or multiple disparate point solutions may initially purchase only one or a few of our solutions. As those customers recognize the value of an integrated platform, they typically expand their footprint over time. As of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our net dollar retention rate was 115.1%, 113.9% and 101.0%, respectively. The increase in our net dollar retention rate between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2023 is primarily due to the lessening impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and 2023 on both the Event and Hospitality Clouds, resulting in increased spend on products supporting in-person events, in addition to the continued adoption of Attendee Hub, our solution for ongoing attendee engagement and hybrid and virtual events. ----- Our resilient business model has yielded strong results across all economic cycles and market conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, during which the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a near-total pause on in-person events, and a shift to virtual formats, our revenue decreased only 12% due to our sum-certain pricing model and multiyear contracts, despite not having a product catering to virtual formats at the start of the pandemic. As the meetings and events industry continues its strong recovery from the pandemic, we have leveraged our comprehensive platform to extend our industry leading position and delivered strong financial results. For the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2023, the Company generated $659.4 million in revenue, representing 22.4% year-over-year growth, a Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA Margin of 33.6% and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Conversion of 73.0%.

1609,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Business Overview,9.1.3,,"Cvent is the leading cloud-based software platform of event marketing and management and hospitality solutions. We support the marketing and management of meetings and events through our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions. Our Event Cloud consists of software solutions and tools to enable event organizers to manage the entire event lifecycle and deliver engaging experiences across every type of event and all event formats: in-person, virtual and hybrid. Event Cloud serves as the system of record for event and engagement data collected across an organization’s total event program, which comprises every internal and external event an organization hosts or attends (“Total Event Program”). Our Hospitality Cloud includes Cvent Supplier Network (“CSN”), a marketplace that connects event organizers looking for the appropriate event space for their in-person and hybrid events with hoteliers and venue operators through a vertical search engine built on our proprietary database of detailed event space information. In addition, our Hospitality Cloud provides software solutions that hotels and venues leverage to digitally showcase their event space to attract valuable leads and grow their business, as well as tools that help our customers manage group room blocks. This combination of our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud results in an integrated solution that is mutually reinforcing. Meetings and events are prevalent in organizations of almost every size, industry vertical and geography. The meetings and events space encompasses a broad spectrum of external marketing events, such as customer events, conferences, trade shows and prospect meetings; and internal events, such as sales kick-offs, training seminars, board meetings, team-building activities and companywide gatherings. Collectively, organizations spent approximately $1 trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018, according to the Events Industry Council. According to a 2021 Frost & Sullivan study we commissioned, the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our platform is $29.7 billion, across our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions. ----- Meetings and events are regarded as some of the most effective ways to build engagement and drive outcomes with customers, employees and members. External events, whether conducted in-person or virtually, are critical to sales and marketing efforts, as they represent opportunities for organizations to directly engage with their most important external audiences. Events offer a highly effective way for organizations to maximize engagement throughout the customer journey, helping them to generate and qualify leads, deepen relationships with customers and build brand loyalty and advocacy. In addition, internal events aid in employee retention and development, as they offer critical opportunities for human resources, training professionals and executive leadership to inspire and motivate their employees through engaging experiences. The ability to host events today across in-person, virtual and hybrid formats offers significant flexibility to event planners and attendees and allows organizations to host more events with more registrants than ever before. Organizations are also increasingly expanding their event technology spend given the increased complexity of their Total Event Program. For event professionals, planning, marketing and executing an event is a highly complex endeavor that can become inefficient and time-consuming when managed using traditional manual processes, homegrown solutions or disparate point software solutions. This complexity is further exacerbated by the proliferation of hybrid events, which essentially require planners to simultaneously execute two events that are consistent across distinct event formats. With events throughout the customer journey now being held across various event types and multiple event formats, organizations increasingly desire a single system of record – one platform – to collect and analyze these interrelated account and attendee engagement data points and act on this data, as well as manage the associated meetings spend, enabling them to measure the impact of, and return on, their events investment.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Meetings and events are regarded as some of the most effective ways to build engagement and drive outcomes with customers, employees and members.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""Meetings and events are regarded as some of the most effective ways to build engagement and drive outcomes with customers, employees and members.""}, ""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""Meetings and events are regarded as some of the most effective ways to build engagement and drive outcomes with customers, employees and members."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: Cvent is the leading cloud-based software platform of event marketing and management and hospitality solutions.

This value proposition is why meetings and events are often regarded as some of the most effective and best funded marketing strategies. According to the Events Industry Council, in aggregate organizations spent approximately $1 trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018. According to a 2021 Forrester study we commissioned, 74% of respondents considered events to be their most important demand generation tactic. Forrester also estimates that events in total comprise approximately 24% of the average organization’s business-to-business marketing program budget. The rapid evolution of the event environment, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly expanded our market opportunity and accelerated the digital transformation of the underpenetrated event management software industry. In this new landscape, organizations can reach larger audiences through multiple event formats, engage with greater frequency given reduced hosting costs associated with virtual events and deliver differentiated experiences with enhanced technology offerings that manage the full lifecycle of events across the Total Event Program. As a result, we believe organizations will host more events with more registrants and will also expand their event technology spend per event. In order to navigate the increased scale and complexity of the new event environment, we believe organizations relying on point solutions or internally developed tools will invest in purposebuilt system of record platforms to automate workflows, enable data collection and facilitate the hosting of events across multiple environments. Also, the global shift to a more distributed workforce is causing organizations to gather in large groups more regularly, further increasing demand for events. As the market leader, Cvent is well-positioned to benefit from these trends to capture share and further penetrate its $29.7 billion TAM. We believe the meetings and events industry is presently benefiting from multiple tailwinds that could facilitate its continued robust recovery from the pandemic. Third-party reports, from the Knowland Group and a major industry consultant, respectively, show that the global volume of event attendees during 2022 was 1.5 billion, approximately 12% below the 2019 level of 1.7 billion prior to the pandemic. In the near-term, we expect event attendance volumes to continue to recover to pre-pandemic levels, driven by the growth of in-person events. A Northstar survey we commissioned found that 67% of event planners expect more events in 2023 compared to 2022 and 70% of event planners expect increases in event budgets in 2023 compared to 2022.

Our strong position","and the positioning of our platform are defensible. We offer a comprehensive cloud-based platform of mission-critical event marketing and management solutions for event planners and marketers and hospitality marketing and software solutions for hoteliers. In connecting both sides of the event landscape, we generate network effects, whereby the value derived by each side is strengthened by its integration with the other side, all facilitated by our platform. ----- In the new event landscape, we expect organizations will require a single platform capable of both driving engagement and managing all of their events. As organizations’ Total Event Programs have rapidly shifted to events across multiple event formats, point solutions are unable to meet the needs of customers. Our Event Cloud offers event planners a platform to manage every type of event and all event formats: in-person, virtual and hybrid. As many incumbent vendors, including Cvent, did not have capabilities for virtual events at the onset of the pandemic, customers were forced to purchase from point solution vendors when rapidly pivoting to virtual events. We believe that in order to manage Total Event Programs across in-person, virtual and hybrid events, many of these organizations will migrate to end-to-end platforms. According to a major industry consultant survey commissioned by the Sponsor, of the 46% of organizations using different event management solutions for in-person and virtual events, approximately 35% are likely to consolidate spend onto a single, end-to-end platform in the near-term. As the industry leader offering a comprehensive platform, we believe Cvent is well-positioned to benefit from this shift. As organizations’ Total Event Programs deliver multiple high-impact touchpoints across the customer journey, marketers require a solution to capture and analyze attendee registration and engagement data across multiple events and all event formats. Our Event Cloud enables event organizers to collect and aggregate a significant amount of data from before, during and after events, creating a single system of record for all event data. Our platform enables organizations to combine and analyze event data with data from their CRM and marketing automation systems to deliver actionable intelligence on customer purchasing intent and next-best actions. The ability to provide value-added insights into the customer journey has made Event Cloud a mission-critical component of an organization’s marketing technology stack, increasing the adoption and retention of our platform. With the rapid return of in-person events amidst industry-wide labor shortages, hotels are increasingly focused on leveraging technology to efficiently expand their group business volumes. Our Hospitality Cloud enables hotels to virtually showcase and market their event space to event planners, source and respond to RFPs and automate the workflows associated with managing group business. The ability to streamline the process for sourcing, winning and managing business for this highly strategic revenue stream makes our platform integral to the operations of hospitality providers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, planners sourced approximately $14.0 billion in RFP value via our platform, illustrating the extent to which Cvent is embedded in the hospitality industry. Cvent brings together both sides of the event ecosystem via CSN, which connects approximately 109,000 meeting and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our extensive proprietary global database as of December 31, 2022.

As many incumbent vendors, including Cvent, did not have capabilities for virtual events at the onset of the pandemic, customers were forced to purchase from point solution vendors when rapidly pivoting to virtual events. We believe that in order to manage Total Event Programs across in-person, virtual and hybrid events, many of these organizations will migrate to end-to-end platforms. According to a major industry consultant survey commissioned by the Sponsor, of the 46% of organizations using different event management solutions for in-person and virtual events, approximately 35% are likely to consolidate spend onto a single, end-to-end platform in the near-term. As the industry leader offering a comprehensive platform, we believe Cvent is well-positioned to benefit from this shift. As organizations\u2019 Total Event Programs deliver multiple high-impact touchpoints across the customer journey, marketers require a solution to capture and analyze attendee registration and engagement data across multiple events and all event formats. Our Event Cloud enables event organizers to collect and aggregate a significant amount of data from before, during and after events, creating a single system of record for all event data. Our platform enables organizations to combine and analyze event data with data from their CRM and marketing automation systems to deliver actionable intelligence on customer purchasing intent and next-best actions. The ability to provide value-added insights into the customer journey has made Event Cloud a mission-critical component of an organization\u2019s marketing technology stack, increasing the adoption and retention of our platform. With the rapid return of in-person events amidst industry-wide labor shortages, hotels are increasingly focused on leveraging technology to efficiently expand their group business volumes. Our Hospitality Cloud enables hotels to virtually showcase and market their event space to event planners, source and respond to RFPs and automate the workflows associated with managing group business. The ability to streamline the process for sourcing, winning and managing business for this highly strategic revenue stream makes our platform integral to the operations of hospitality providers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, planners sourced approximately $14.0 billion in RFP value via our platform, illustrating the extent to which Cvent is embedded in the hospitality industry. Cvent brings together both sides of the event ecosystem via CSN, which connects approximately 109,000 meeting and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our extensive proprietary global database as of December 31, 2022. As a result of its breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and extensiveness of its proprietary database, we believe CSN is highly differentiated. We also believe that these factors enable our marketplace to generate network effects that continually attract event planners and hospitality providers to our platform. -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}","{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""As many incumbent vendors, including Cvent, did not have capabilities for virtual events at the onset of the pandemic, customers were forced to purchase from point solution vendors when rapidly pivoting to virtual events.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""As many incumbent vendors, including Cvent, did not have capabilities for virtual events at the onset of the pandemic, customers were forced to purchase from point solution vendors when rapidly pivoting to virtual events.""}, ""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""As many incumbent vendors, including Cvent, did not have capabilities for virtual events at the onset of the pandemic, customers were forced to purchase from point solution vendors when rapidly pivoting to virtual events."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the industry is susceptible to rapid technological advances or innovations?\nTitle: Industry Leader with Comprehensive, Differentiated Solutions with Network Effects.

1609,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Key Credit Strengths,9.4.3,Recession-Resilient and Steady Revenue Model Underpinned by Sum-Certain Contracts. Cvent operates,"a resilient business model, generating revenue from Event Cloud subscription-based solutions and Hospitality Cloud marketing-based and subscription-based solutions. The Company’s subscription-based revenue model and strong emphasis on selling multi-year contracts results in visible, predictable and durable revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2022, recurring revenue represented 93% of total revenue and approximately 50% of the annual contractual dollar value of bookings was associated with multi-year subscription contracts. Central to this resilient business model is the Company’s contracting and pricing structure. Event Cloud contract amounts are sum-certain based on the committed annual minimum number of registrants and events, rather than on a purely per-event or per-registrant basis. Generally, if a customer exceeds the number of purchased registrations, the customer will incur an overage fee for registrations that exceeded the number of registrations purchased. Hospitality Cloud marketing revenue is generated based on the number of marketing solutions purchased, rather than on a pay-per-click or impression basis, and software solutions are priced primarily on the number of licenses purchased. We believe that CSN is a differentiated solution that plays an important role in the sales and marketing strategy of hospitality providers by enabling them to cost-effectively generate leads, win group business and drive revenue growth. The terms of our subscription and marketing contracts for both Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud are typically non-cancellable, are for annual or multi-year terms and are billed in advance on an annual or quarterly basis. Cvent’s recession-resilient model, combined with its experienced, long-tenured management team and strong culture of innovation, has enabled the Company to deliver strong financial performance through multiple market cycles, including the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company demonstrated the strength of its business model during the pandemic when, despite a near-total pause on in-person events, revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 declined only 12%, and the Company subsequently returned to revenue growth of 4% and 22% in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

We have a large,","diversified customer base with approximately 11,000 customers using Event Cloud and approximately 11,000 customers using Hospitality Cloud.

Our customers are spread across diverse industries and sectors including companies from hospitality, healthcare, financial services, technology, education, and industrials, among others, as well as trade associations and non-profits. As it relates to hotels, the vast majority of purchasing occurs at the property level, rather than at the corporate brand level. As a result, the Company has limited revenue concentration, with the largest customer accounting for less than 1% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Cvent’s customer base exhibits attractive unit economics, with high levels of retention and expansion across the platform.

1609,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Key Credit Strengths,9.4.5,"Attractive Financial Profile Complemented by Clear Path for Margin Expansion via Identified Cost Savings and Operating Leverage. Cvent maintains an attractive financial profile, characterized by a combination of","long-term growth, strong profitability and consistent free cash flow generation. Cvent demonstrated strong resiliency through the unprecedented disruption to the event ecosystem resulting from the pandemic, realizing a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.6% for the three-year period from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2022 when the underlying events market declined significantly. The Company has accelerated growth following the pandemic, generating $659.4 million in revenue for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023, representing 22.4% over the prior year period. In addition to its durable growth, Cvent maintains attractive unit economics, characterized by 73.3% NonGAAP Gross Margin for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, high levels of customer retention and an integrated technology stack that enables cost-effective cross-sell and upsell. As a result, the Company has the ability to operate at high margins: for example, in 2017, the Company generated 32.7% Adjusted Cash EBITDA margins. From 2017 to 2022, we experienced a decline in margins due to intentional investments to support long-term growth. We consolidated ten products into four, including the migration of the Lanyon customer base, re-built our core event management platform and quickly built and deployed a virtual solution at scale during COVID-19 to meet the rapidly evolving needs of customers resulting from the disruption to in-person events. The increased level of investment during this period was primarily focused on research and development but also temporarily constrained the efficiency with which we were able to sell, serve and support our customers. As a result, for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023, the Company generated $147.0 million of Adjusted Cash EBITDA, representing a 22.3% margin and $87.3 million of Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, representing 59.3% Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Conversion. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information— Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.” We believe that the Company’s competitive position is stronger than ever and that we are now wellpositioned to benefit from these investments. In 2022, Cvent reached an inflection point as the events end market stabilized which, coupled with its recent platform and product enhancements, enabled the Company to prioritize operational improvements to better manage its cost structure, drive margin expansion and boost profitability going forward. In particular, the Company began to right-size its level of investment in certain areas through headcount optimization and vendor rationalization. Notably, headcount decreased 2.1% between November 30, 2022 and March 31, 2023 while revenue growth has continued to accelerate, as demonstrated by the 21% revenue growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022. As a result of the Sponsor’s diligence, several areas of opportunities for additional efficiency have been identified that could accelerate realization of cost savings. According to a report from a third-party consultant ----- commissioned by the Sponsor, the aggregate cost savings opportunity is up to approximately $74 million, with potential upside. We believe that these savings, which are split between labor (approximately $58 million) and procurement (approximately $16 million), are readily actionable and achievable. Labor initiatives include the continued automation of manual processes as well as further offshoring of research and development personnel to our India office. Additionally, we plan to right-size and simplify the organization, and selectively outsource non-core functions, especially within services, customer support, and corporate IT. On the procurement side, cost savings will be largely driven by vendor rationalization, top vendor negotiation, and office footprint consolidation. We expect a majority of savings will be realized within 12 months of the closing of the Transactions and the full-run rate savings will be realized in 18 months following closing of the Transactions. Fully implemented, these cost saving measures could result in improved Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA Margins of approximately 34%, which are in line with our margin profile for fiscal year 2017 on a revenue base that is approximately 63% larger as of the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023 compared to fiscal year 2017. Note that these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies.

As a result of the Sponsor\u2019s diligence, several areas of opportunities for additional efficiency have been identified that could accelerate realization of cost savings. According to a report from a third-party consultant ----- commissioned by the Sponsor, the aggregate cost savings opportunity is up to approximately $74 million, with potential upside. We believe that these savings, which are split between labor (approximately $58 million) and procurement (approximately $16 million), are readily actionable and achievable. Labor initiatives include the continued automation of manual processes as well as further offshoring of research and development personnel to our India office. Additionally, we plan to right-size and simplify the organization, and selectively outsource non-core functions, especially within services, customer support, and corporate IT. On the procurement side, cost savings will be largely driven by vendor rationalization, top vendor negotiation, and office footprint consolidation. We expect a majority of savings will be realized within 12 months of the closing of the Transactions and the full-run rate savings will be realized in 18 months following closing of the Transactions. Fully implemented, these cost saving measures could result in improved Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA Margins of approximately 34%, which are in line with our margin profile for fiscal year 2017 on a revenue base that is approximately 63% larger as of the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023 compared to fiscal year 2017. Note that these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. See \u201cRisk Factors\u2014Risks Related to the Transactions\u2014We may not realize the anticipated cost savings from the Transactions.\u201d\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

1609,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Competitive Strengths,9.5.5,"Large Seamless Online Venue Marketplace. We believe that CSN is a valuable, proprietary resource for","both components of the meetings and events ecosystem—marketers and event planners as well as hoteliers and venue operators—due to its: - _Depth and Breadth of Venue Profiles. Our proprietary network includes detailed event space profile information on over 302,000 hotels and other venues as of December 31, 2022. CSN enables planners to conduct searches and filter results based on over 200 characteristics and criteria per hotel profile. The size and accuracy of our database is of critical importance to planners and sets CSN apart. - _Billions in RFP Value. During 2022, planners sourced approximately $14.0 billion in RFP value through our sourcing tools, including CSN. In interviews conducted by a third-party consultant on behalf of the Sponsor, several Hospitality Cloud customers indicated that CSN is the largest source of RFP volume for their group business. We believe that by offering a global marketplace to connect both sides of the events ecosystem, CSN is a critical external lead generation channel for event and group meetings business. - _Integration with Hotels. As of December 31, 2022, we are directly integrated with the back-end sales, catering and IT systems of more than 41,000 hotels, reducing manual data entry for hotel staff and enabling a more efficient RFP response process. We believe this level of adoption and back-end IT system integration from our hotel partners is further evidence of the value hoteliers and venues derive from CSN. - _Network Effects Across the Events Ecosystem. By connecting both sides of the meetings and events ecosystem, CSN generates network effects. As more hoteliers and venue operators list and market their properties on CSN, it becomes more valuable to the more than 109,000 event planners and marketers sourcing venues for their events. Increased usage by event planners increases the volume of RFPs delivered to hotels and venues, thereby increasing the value we deliver to hoteliers and venue operators and causing more hotels and venues to list their properties on the network. - _Efficiency for Planners. The vertical nature of CSN makes it a highly relevant and effective tool for planners in identifying an appropriate venue. CSN also provides substantial time savings benefits, as planners can quickly evaluate, generally at no cost, an extensive network of potential hotels and venues and receive rapid responses from a selected shortlist. ----- - _Lead Sourcing for Hoteliers and Venue Operators._ Our ability to connect hoteliers and venue operators with high quality leads makes us an essential resource for hoteliers and venue operators and has resulted in a significant volume of RFPs processed. In part due to the extensive scope of our marketplace, many hotels have integrated CSN into their core back-end IT systems. Recurring Revenue Model with Sum-Certain Contracts._** Our business model is highly recurring and predictable with annual or multi-year subscriptions under sum-certain contracts. Our multi-year contracts deliver strong revenue visibility and resilience, as evidenced by our performance through the COVID-19 pandemic. Contracts for our Event Cloud solution range from one to five years in length. These contracts generally include subscription fees for licensed modules, which are based on volume commitments aligned with the registrations and events anticipated across the customer’s Total Event Program. Our Event Cloud contracts typically include overage fees for usage beyond the specified registrant and event amounts.

Moreover, litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert the Company\u2019s or our respective managements\u2019 attention away from their regular business, and, if any lawsuit is adversely resolved against us, could have a material adverse impact on its or our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Transactions is that no law, order or injunction prohibits the consummation of the Transactions. The Company and members of our board of directors were named as defendants in a two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York captioned _O\u2019Dell v. Cvent Holding Corp. et al., Case No. 23-cv-03688 (filed May 2, 2023) and Wang v. Cvent Holding Corp. et al., Case No. 23-cv-03799 (filed May 5, 2023). The Company and members of our board of directors were also named_ as defendants in one lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Westchester captioned _Herzog v. Aggarwal, Index No. 61007/2023, (filed May 10, 2023). These lawsuits challenges the adequacy of the_ public disclosures related to the merger and seeks, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin us from completing the merger. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in these lawsuits and the plaintiffs in this litigation or in possible future similar lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the merger, then such an injunction may prevent the merger from being completed, or delay it from being completed within the expected time frame.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of the notes, and the fair market value of the Collateral will be subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, changing economic conditions, competition and other future trends. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the lenders under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the holders of the notes will be entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of the Collateral before any payment is made in respect of any other indebtedness that is secured by a junior lien on the Collateral or that is unsecured. Moreover, the lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by an equal priority lien on the Collateral will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the holders of the notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage available to holders of the notes. In particular, the fair market value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the Collateral, if any. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the notes and other obligations secured by an equal priority lien on the Collateral will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to receive postpetition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the notes exceeded the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other equal priority debt that was also secured by the Collateral, including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the notes. See “—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees.” With respect to some of the Collateral, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent and its ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents and making additional filings. If the Issuer is unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuer will be permitted to incur indebtedness in amounts in excess of the current commitments under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit the Issuer and the guarantors to create additional liens on the Collateral under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be equal priority with or senior to the liens securing the notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further dilute the collateral coverage and limit the recovery from the realization of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the notes.

Moreover, the lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities and the holders of any other additional indebtedness secured by an equal priority lien on the Collateral will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the holders of the notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage available to holders of the notes. In particular, the fair market value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the holders of the notes upon any foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding and after the repayment of indebtedness with prior security interests in the Collateral, if any. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable, and even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the notes and other obligations secured by an equal priority lien on the Collateral will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer\u2019s unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, as discussed further below, the holders of the notes would not be entitled to receive postpetition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the notes exceeded the value of the Collateral (after taking into account all other equal priority debt that was also secured by the Collateral, including the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities), or any \u201cadequate protection\u201d on account of any undersecured portion of the notes. See \u201c\u2014In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuer or any of the guarantors, the holders of the notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuer\u2019s obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of the Collateral securing the notes and the related guarantees.\u201d With respect to some of the Collateral, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent and its ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third-party consents and making additional filings. If the Issuer is unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders will not be entitled to the Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure you that any such required consents will be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the notes, the Issuer will be permitted to incur indebtedness in amounts in excess of the current commitments under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The indenture that will govern the notes will also permit the Issuer and the guarantors to create additional liens on the Collateral under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be equal priority with or senior to the liens securing the notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further dilute the collateral coverage and limit the recovery from the realization of the collateral available to satisfy holders of the notes.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens was a fraudulent conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the ----- notes or such guarantee or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of such Issuer or such guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee or, in the case of the notes and the related guarantees, void the granting of liens to secure the notes or the related guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in acceleration of such debt. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that the Issuer or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee and/or lien if the Issuer or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens in the case of the notes), subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. To the extent a court avoids any of the guarantees as fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, (x) the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable guarantor or (y) in the case of liens granted to secure the notes or the related guarantees, the holders of notes would cease to have a secured claim against the Issuer or the guarantors, as applicable. If a court were to take this action, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the Issuer or the applicable guarantor. Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time such Issuer or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to the Issuer or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside ----- party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against the Issuer or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.\nText: The issuance of the notes and the guarantees and, in the case of the notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens by the Issuer and the guarantors (including any future guarantees and future liens) may be subject to review under federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes if a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization case or a lawsuit, including under circumstances in which bankruptcy is not involved, were commenced at some future date by the Issuer, by the guarantors or on behalf of our unpaid creditors or the unpaid creditors of a guarantor.

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of the notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount thereof may be allowed in an amount equal to the sum of: - the original issue price of the notes; and - that portion of the stated principal amount of the notes that exceeds the issue price thereof, if any, that does not constitute \u201cunmatured interest\u201d for the purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

During the course of an event, our platform enables event marketers and planners to process registrations, check-in attendees, conduct sessions, broadcast sessions, facilitate networking appointments, capture leads and manage on-going communication with attendees via an event-specific mobile app. Following an event, exhibitors and sponsors can act on leads collected and scored via our platform and provide registrants with access to on-demand video content, while event organizers can leverage our platform to analyze registration, attendance, session data and survey responses to measure engagement, content effectiveness and overall event success. Our platform leverages specific engagement actions within our Event Cloud solution to generate an engagement score for each attendee.

Our platform helps hotels find event organizers and win group business by enabling them to digitally showcase their event space and automate the RFP process, while also providing event organizers the tools needed to search, diligence, negotiate and contract with hotels for event space. CSN connects approximately 109,000 meeting and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our proprietary global database as of December 31, 2022. We believe the breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and extensiveness of its proprietary database makes CSN a highly differentiated platform and well positioned in the industry. We believe that CSN contains one of the world’s most extensive and accurate repositories of detailed meeting venue information, empowering event organizers to search for, and qualify, potential event sites. We also believe that our marketplace generates network effects that simultaneously increase the volume of requests for proposal (“RFPs”) submitted from event organizers and increase the number of hospitality professionals using our system to respond to RFPs. Our Hospitality Cloud also offers software solutions to hotels and venues that improve the group sales process and streamline collaboration between hoteliers and event organizers to design, manage and execute events. Our software solutions include, but are not limited to, lead scoring to prioritize group RFPs received via CSN, event diagramming to collaborate with event organizers on designing optimal and safe event layouts and viewing threedimensional renderings, room block management that allows hotels and planners to work in concert to efficiently manage guest room reservations and room blocks for events and enables event attendees to reserve hotel rooms, business transient solutions that simplify how hotels attract, manage and win corporate travel business and business intelligence solutions to benchmark against internal and targeted competitive metrics. We sell our platform primarily through a direct inside sales team. For our Event Cloud, our customers enter annual and multi-year subscriptions to utilize our cloud-based event marketing and management solutions. The amount of these sum-certain contracts is contractually committed upfront based on the expected aggregate number of registrants for all events across an organization’s Total Event Program in a given year. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers. For our Hospitality Cloud, hotels and venues enter into annual and multi-year contracts for group business marketing solutions and software. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 11,000 Hospitality Cloud customers. We employ a land-and-expand business model, where customers grow their spend with us over time. As our Event Cloud customers grow their Total Event Program by launching new types of events, running more events and attracting additional registrants to their events, their contracts are typically renewed at higher annual values. Additionally, customers purchasing our platform to replace certain homegrown or multiple disparate point solutions may initially purchase only one or a few of our solutions. As those customers recognize the value of an integrated platform, they typically expand their footprint over time. As of March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, our net dollar retention rate was 115.1%, 113.9% and 101.0%, respectively. The increase in our net dollar retention rate between December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2023 is primarily due to the lessening impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and 2023 on both the Event and Hospitality Clouds, resulting in increased spend on products supporting in-person events, in addition to the continued adoption of Attendee Hub, our solution for ongoing attendee engagement and hybrid and virtual events. ----- Our resilient business model has yielded strong results across all economic cycles and market conditions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, during which the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a near-total pause on in-person events, and a shift to virtual formats, our revenue decreased only 12% due to our sum-certain pricing model and multiyear contracts, despite not having a product catering to virtual formats at the start of the pandemic. As the meetings and events industry continues its strong recovery from the pandemic, we have leveraged our comprehensive platform to extend our industry leading position and delivered strong financial results. For the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2023, the Company generated $659.4 million in revenue, representing 22.4% year-over-year growth, a Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA Margin of 33.6% and Pro Forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Conversion of 73.0%.

Our platform helps hotels find event organizers and win group business by enabling them to digitally showcase their event space and automate the RFP process, while also providing event organizers the tools needed to search, diligence, negotiate and contract with hotels for event space. CSN connects approximately 109,000 meeting and event organizers with over 302,000 hotels and venues featured in our proprietary global database as of December 31, 2022. We believe the breadth of participants, depth of industry relationships and extensiveness of its proprietary database makes CSN a highly differentiated platform and well positioned in the industry. We believe that CSN contains one of the world\u2019s most extensive and accurate repositories of detailed meeting venue information, empowering event organizers to search for, and qualify, potential event sites. We also believe that our marketplace generates network effects that simultaneously increase the volume of requests for proposal (\u201cRFPs\u201d) submitted from event organizers and increase the number of hospitality professionals using our system to respond to RFPs. Our Hospitality Cloud also offers software solutions to hotels and venues that improve the group sales process and streamline collaboration between hoteliers and event organizers to design, manage and execute events. Our software solutions include, but are not limited to, lead scoring to prioritize group RFPs received via CSN, event diagramming to collaborate with event organizers on designing optimal and safe event layouts and viewing threedimensional renderings, room block management that allows hotels and planners to work in concert to efficiently manage guest room reservations and room blocks for events and enables event attendees to reserve hotel rooms, business transient solutions that simplify how hotels attract, manage and win corporate travel business and business intelligence solutions to benchmark against internal and targeted competitive metrics. We sell our platform primarily through a direct inside sales team. For our Event Cloud, our customers enter annual and multi-year subscriptions to utilize our cloud-based event marketing and management solutions. The amount of these sum-certain contracts is contractually committed upfront based on the expected aggregate number of registrants for all events across an organization\u2019s Total Event Program in a given year.

We support the marketing and management of meetings and events through our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions. Our Event Cloud consists of software solutions and tools to enable event organizers to manage the entire event lifecycle and deliver engaging experiences across every type of event and all event formats: in-person, virtual and hybrid. Event Cloud serves as the system of record for event and engagement data collected across an organization’s total event program, which comprises every internal and external event an organization hosts or attends (“Total Event Program”). Our Hospitality Cloud includes Cvent Supplier Network (“CSN”), a marketplace that connects event organizers looking for the appropriate event space for their in-person and hybrid events with hoteliers and venue operators through a vertical search engine built on our proprietary database of detailed event space information. In addition, our Hospitality Cloud provides software solutions that hotels and venues leverage to digitally showcase their event space to attract valuable leads and grow their business, as well as tools that help our customers manage group room blocks. This combination of our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud results in an integrated solution that is mutually reinforcing. Meetings and events are prevalent in organizations of almost every size, industry vertical and geography. The meetings and events space encompasses a broad spectrum of external marketing events, such as customer events, conferences, trade shows and prospect meetings; and internal events, such as sales kick-offs, training seminars, board meetings, team-building activities and companywide gatherings. Collectively, organizations spent approximately $1 trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018, according to the Events Industry Council. According to a 2021 Frost & Sullivan study we commissioned, the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our platform is $29.7 billion, across our Event Cloud and Hospitality Cloud solutions. Meetings and events are regarded as some of the most effective ways to build engagement and drive outcomes with customers, employees and members. External events, whether conducted in-person or virtually, are critical to sales and marketing efforts, as they represent opportunities for organizations to directly engage with their most important external audiences. Events offer a highly effective way for organizations to maximize engagement ----- throughout the customer journey, helping them to generate and qualify leads, deepen relationships with customers and build brand loyalty and advocacy. In addition, internal events aid in employee retention and development, as they offer critical opportunities for human resources, training professionals and executive leadership to inspire and motivate their employees through engaging experiences. In 2020, the meetings and events industry was transformed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which forced events into virtual environments and accelerated the ongoing digital transformation of the events industry. For virtual events, the event technology is the event venue, video is the primary method of content delivery and virtual attendees create a digital footprint of all of their event engagement that can be captured, analyzed and leveraged to both deliver better event experiences and inform subsequent sales and marketing efforts. Even as the pandemic has subsided, we believe virtual events will continue to remain prominent due to their ability to attract and engage vast audiences across the globe. However, we believe the fundamental and innate desire to meet in-person will mean that organizations’ Total Event Programs will be primarily characterized by in-person events, complemented by virtual events and hybrid events that offer the benefits of both. The hybrid event model enables organizations to harness the advantages of both inperson and virtual meetings at the same time by reaching both a broader audience and achieving greater levels of engagement across far more attendees, thereby unlocking the potential for maximum return on their events investment. The ability to host events today across in-person, virtual and hybrid formats offers significant flexibility to event planners and attendees and allows organizations to host more events with more registrants than ever before. Organizations are also increasingly expanding their event technology spend given the increased complexity of their Total Event Program. For event professionals, planning, marketing and executing an event is a highly complex endeavor that can become inefficient and time-consuming when managed using traditional manual processes, homegrown solutions or disparate point software solutions. This complexity is further exacerbated by the proliferation of hybrid events, which essentially require planners to simultaneously execute two events that are consistent across distinct event formats. With events throughout the customer journey now being held across various event types and multiple event formats, organizations increasingly desire a single system of record—one platform—to collect and analyze these interrelated account and attendee engagement data points and act on this data, as well as manage the associated meetings spend, enabling them to measure the impact of, and return on, their events investment.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""However, we believe the fundamental and innate desire to meet in-person will mean that organizations\u2019 Total Event Programs will be primarily characterized by in-person events, complemented by virtual events and hybrid events that offer the benefits of both.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""However, we believe the fundamental and innate desire to meet in-person will mean that organizations\u2019 Total Event Programs will be primarily characterized by in-person events, complemented by virtual events and hybrid events that offer the benefits of both.""}, ""answer"": ""Yes"", ""evidence"": ""However, we believe the fundamental and innate desire to meet in-person will mean that organizations\u2019 Total Event Programs will be primarily characterized by in-person events, complemented by virtual events and hybrid events that offer the benefits of both."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: Cvent is the leading cloud-based software platform of event marketing and management and hospitality solutions.

Some event organizers may attempt to manage their Total Event Program and attendee data with an ----- array of disparate point solutions designed for a specific event delivery model, like virtual only or in-person only, or designed only for a specific portion of the event lifecycle, such as registration, a mobile app or onsite check-in. However, these point solutions leave attendee engagement data isolated in silos and typically lack the functionality for executing events across event formats, as well as the integration and data sharing capabilities to create a single system of record for the Total Event Program. We believe the inability to put together a full and clear picture of interest will lead organizations to use one event technology platform that can show prospect and customer intent across the Total Event Program.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

1609,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.7,Key Credit Strengths,17.7.1,"Addressing Large and Growing, Yet Underpenetrated Opportunity Experiencing Rapid Digitalization.","Meetings and events represent one of the most effective ways for organizations to engage, educate and motivate their target audiences. This value proposition is why meetings and events are often regarded as some of the most effective and best funded marketing strategies. According to the Events Industry Council, in aggregate organizations spent approximately $1 trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018. According to a 2021 Forrester study we commissioned, 74% of respondents considered events to be their most important demand generation tactic. Forrester also estimates that events in total comprise approximately 24% of the average organization’s business-to-business marketing program budget. The rapid evolution of the event environment, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly expanded our market opportunity and accelerated the digital transformation of the underpenetrated event management software industry. In this new landscape, organizations can reach larger audiences through multiple event formats, engage with greater frequency given reduced hosting costs associated with virtual events and deliver differentiated experiences with enhanced technology offerings that manage the full lifecycle of events across the Total Event Program. As a result, we believe organizations will host more events with more registrants and will also expand their event technology spend per event. In order to navigate the increased scale and complexity of the new event environment, we believe organizations relying on point solutions or internally developed tools will invest in purposebuilt system of record platforms to automate workflows, enable data collection and facilitate the hosting of events across multiple environments. Also, the global shift to a more distributed workforce is causing organizations to gather in large groups more regularly, further increasing demand for events. As the market leader, Cvent is well-positioned to benefit from these trends to capture share and further penetrate its $29.7 billion TAM. We believe the meetings and events industry is presently benefiting from multiple tailwinds that could facilitate its continued robust recovery from the pandemic. Third-party reports, from the Knowland Group and a major industry consultant, respectively, show that the global volume of event attendees during 2022 was 1.5 billion, approximately 12% below the 2019 level of 1.7 billion prior to the pandemic. In the near-term, we expect event attendance volumes to continue to recover to pre-pandemic levels, driven by the growth of in-person events. A Northstar survey we commissioned found that 67% of event planners expect more events in 2023 compared to 2022 and 70% of event planners expect increases in event budgets in 2023 compared to 2022.

This value proposition is why meetings and events are often regarded as some of the most effective and best funded marketing strategies. According to the Events Industry Council, in aggregate organizations spent approximately $1 trillion on meetings and events globally in 2018. According to a 2021 Forrester study we commissioned, 74% of respondents considered events to be their most important demand generation tactic. Forrester also estimates that events in total comprise approximately 24% of the average organization\u2019s business-to-business marketing program budget. The rapid evolution of the event environment, catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, has significantly expanded our market opportunity and accelerated the digital transformation of the underpenetrated event management software industry. In this new landscape, organizations can reach larger audiences through multiple event formats, engage with greater frequency given reduced hosting costs associated with virtual events and deliver differentiated experiences with enhanced technology offerings that manage the full lifecycle of events across the Total Event Program. As a result, we believe organizations will host more events with more registrants and will also expand their event technology spend per event. In order to navigate the increased scale and complexity of the new event environment, we believe organizations relying on point solutions or internally developed tools will invest in purposebuilt system of record platforms to automate workflows, enable data collection and facilitate the hosting of events across multiple environments. Also, the global shift to a more distributed workforce is causing organizations to gather in large groups more regularly, further increasing demand for events. As the market leader, Cvent is well-positioned to benefit from these trends to capture share and further penetrate its $29.7 billion TAM. We believe the meetings and events industry is presently benefiting from multiple tailwinds that could facilitate its continued robust recovery from the pandemic. Third-party reports, from the Knowland Group and a major industry consultant, respectively, show that the global volume of event attendees during 2022 was 1.5 billion, approximately 12% below the 2019 level of 1.7 billion prior to the pandemic. In the near-term, we expect event attendance volumes to continue to recover to pre-pandemic levels, driven by the growth of in-person events. A Northstar survey we commissioned found that 67% of event planners expect more events in 2023 compared to 2022 and 70% of event planners expect increases in event budgets in 2023 compared to 2022.

Cvent maintains an attractive financial profile, characterized by a combination of","long-term growth, strong profitability and consistent free cash flow generation. Cvent demonstrated strong resiliency through the unprecedented disruption to the event ecosystem resulting from the pandemic, realizing a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.6% for the three-year period from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2022 when the underlying events market declined significantly. The Company has accelerated growth following the pandemic, generating $659.4 million in revenue for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023, representing 22.4% over the prior year period. In addition to its durable growth, Cvent maintains attractive unit economics, characterized by 73.3% NonGAAP Gross Margin for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, high levels of customer retention and an integrated technology stack that enables cost-effective cross-sell and upsell. As a result, the Company has the ability to operate at high margins: for example, in 2017, the Company generated 32.7% Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin. From 2017 to 2022, we experienced a decline in margins due to intentional investments to support long-term growth. We consolidated ten products into four, including the migration of the Lanyon customer base, re-built our core event management platform and quickly built and deployed a virtual solution at scale during COVID-19 to meet the rapidly evolving needs of customers resulting from the disruption to in-person events. The increased level of investment during this period was primarily focused on research and development but also temporarily constrained the efficiency with which we were able to sell, serve and support our customers. As a result, for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2023, the Company generated $147.0 million of Adjusted Cash EBITDA, representing a 22.3% margin and $87.3 million of Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures, representing 59.3% Adjusted Cash EBITDA less Capital Expenditures Conversion. See “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information— Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.” We believe that the Company’s competitive position is stronger than ever and that we are now wellpositioned to benefit from these investments. In 2022, Cvent reached an inflection point as the events end market stabilized which, coupled with its recent platform and product enhancements, enabled the Company to prioritize operational improvements to better manage its cost structure, drive margin expansion and boost profitability going forward. In particular, the Company began to right-size its level of investment in certain areas through headcount optimization and vendor rationalization. Notably, headcount decreased 2.1% between November 30, 2022 and March 31, 2023 while revenue growth has continued to accelerate, as demonstrated by the 21% revenue growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022. ----- As a result of the Sponsor’s diligence, several areas of opportunities for additional efficiency have been identified that could accelerate realization of cost savings. According to a report from a third-party consultant commissioned by the Sponsor, the aggregate cost savings opportunity is $74 million, with potential upside. We believe that these savings, which are split between labor (approximately $58 million) and procurement (approximately $16 million), are readily actionable and achievable. Labor initiatives include the continued automation of manual processes as well as further offshoring of research and development personnel to our India office. Additionally, we plan to right-size and simplify the organization, and selectively outsource non-core functions, especially within services, customer support, and corporate IT. On the procurement side, cost savings will be largely driven by vendor rationalization, top vendor negotiation, and office footprint consolidation. We expect a majority of savings will be realized within 12 months and the full-run rate savings will be realized in 18 months. Fully implemented, these cost saving measures could result in improved pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin of approximately 34%, which are in line with our margin profile in 2017 on a revenue base that is approximately 63% larger as of March 31, 2023.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Attractive Financial Profile Complemented by Clear Path for Margin Expansion via Identified Cost Savings and Operating Leverage.

In 2022, Cvent reached an inflection point as the events end market stabilized which, coupled with its recent platform and product enhancements, enabled the Company to prioritize operational improvements to better manage its cost structure, drive margin expansion and boost profitability going forward. In particular, the Company began to right-size its level of investment in certain areas through headcount optimization and vendor rationalization. Notably, headcount decreased 2.1% between November 30, 2022 and March 31, 2023 while revenue growth has continued to accelerate, as demonstrated by the 21% revenue growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022. ----- As a result of the Sponsor\u2019s diligence, several areas of opportunities for additional efficiency have been identified that could accelerate realization of cost savings. According to a report from a third-party consultant commissioned by the Sponsor, the aggregate cost savings opportunity is $74 million, with potential upside. We believe that these savings, which are split between labor (approximately $58 million) and procurement (approximately $16 million), are readily actionable and achievable. Labor initiatives include the continued automation of manual processes as well as further offshoring of research and development personnel to our India office. Additionally, we plan to right-size and simplify the organization, and selectively outsource non-core functions, especially within services, customer support, and corporate IT. On the procurement side, cost savings will be largely driven by vendor rationalization, top vendor negotiation, and office footprint consolidation. We expect a majority of savings will be realized within 12 months and the full-run rate savings will be realized in 18 months. Fully implemented, these cost saving measures could result in improved pro forma Adjusted Cash EBITDA margin of approximately 34%, which are in line with our margin profile in 2017 on a revenue base that is approximately 63% larger as of March 31, 2023.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

1609,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.8,Our Competitive Strengths,17.8.5,"Large Seamless Online Venue Marketplace. We believe that CSN is a valuable, proprietary resource for","both components of the meetings and events ecosystem—marketers and event planners as well as hoteliers and venue operators—due to its: - _Depth and Breadth of Venue Profiles. Our proprietary network includes detailed event space profile information on over 302,000 hotels and other venues as of December 31, 2022. CSN enables planners to conduct searches and filter results based on over 200 characteristics and criteria per hotel profile. Once an event space is identified, CSN enables planners to visit some venues virtually via three-dimensional models. A portion of the underlying event data is submitted by the hotels and venues and a portion is researched by our expert team, which has created an extensive data set with an exceptional level of detail and granularity. Our team of customer-facing staff maintain relationships and work with the venues to keep their information up to date and enhance the data richness of CSN. The size and accuracy of our database is of critical importance to planners and sets CSN apart. - _Billions in RFP Value. During 2022, planners sourced approximately $14.0 billion in RFP value through our sourcing tools, including CSN. In interviews conducted by a third-party consultant on behalf of the Sponsor, several Hospitality Cloud customers indicated that CSN is the largest source of RFP volume for their group business. We believe that by offering a global marketplace to connect both sides of the events ecosystem, CSN is a critical external lead generation channel for event and group meetings business. - _Integration with Hotels. As of December 31, 2022, we are directly integrated with the back-end sales, catering and IT systems of more than 41,000 hotels, reducing manual data entry for hotel staff and enabling a more efficient RFP response process. We believe this level of adoption and back-end IT system integration from our hotel partners is further evidence of the value hoteliers and venues derive from CSN. - _Network Effects Across the Events Ecosystem. By connecting both sides of the meetings and events ecosystem, CSN generates network effects. As more hoteliers and venue operators list and market their properties on CSN, it becomes more valuable to the more than 109,000 event planners and marketers sourcing venues for their events. Increased usage by event planners increases the volume of RFPs delivered to hotels and venues, thereby increasing the value we deliver to hoteliers and venue operators and causing more hotels and venues to list their properties on the network. ----- - _Efficiency for Planners. Planners use CSN, generally at no cost, to search for venues, request price quotes and proposals from hotels and venues and compare proposals to identify the venue that best meets the specialized needs and requirements of their event. The vertical nature of CSN makes it a highly relevant and effective tool for planners in identifying an appropriate venue. CSN also provides substantial time savings benefits, as planners can quickly evaluate, generally at no cost, an extensive network of potential hotels and venues and receive rapid responses from a selected shortlist. - _Lead Sourcing for Hoteliers and Venue Operators._ Hotel and venue operators list their event spaces on CSN in order to receive and respond to event proposal requests from planners. Our ability to connect hoteliers and venue operators with high-quality leads makes us an essential resource for hoteliers and venue operators and has resulted in a significant volume of RFPs processed.

With the return in-person events, group meetings business again represents a significant component of hotel revenue. We believe that hoteliers seeking to grow their group meetings revenue will increasingly seek out technology solutions ----- to market their venues and generate incremental business. With hoteliers and venue operators operating with reduced workforces and managing through a tight and competitive labor market, our solution enables them to automate marketing and sales processes to drive efficiency with fewer resources.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

Our Event Cloud consists of multiple,"solutions for marketing and managing meetings and events. As of December 31, 2022, 56% of our Event Cloud customers have subscriptions to more than one of our solutions. We believe there is a significant opportunity to crosssell additional solutions and add-on modules within our existing base of approximately 11,000 Event Cloud customers as of December 31, 2022. As the meetings and events ecosystem digitally transforms, we believe that organizations will derive even greater value from a platform that drives engagement and enables the seamless management of their Total Event Program. We also believe that the expanded reach and effectiveness of virtual and hybrid events drive growth in both the number of events and the number of registrants. As a result, we believe that our renewing Event Cloud customers are likely to increase their overall contract value through both larger Total Event Programs and the adoption of additional solutions. Additionally, we believe that we can cross-sell new subscriptions or additional functionality to the approximately 109,000 planners that have access to CSN free of charge, some of whom also have paid subscriptions to our other Event Cloud solutions. Our Hospitality Cloud solution not only connects hotels and venues with tens of thousands of planners, but also provides a suite of products to market their venues and manage sales and operations of their group business. We continue to expand our inventory of marketing placements and add specialized tiers for hotels and venues to purchase and develop software solutions to help manage group business. As we add these new capabilities, we believe that hoteliers and venue operators will leverage our marketplace offerings to reach buyers at scale and expand the use of our platform to manage the marketing, sales and operations of their group meetings business more efficiently and profitably. In addition, our Hospitality Cloud software products have demonstrated compelling adoption momentum by our customers with headroom for further growth.

The Issuer will issue $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of      % senior secured notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) under an indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated as of the Issue Date among the Issuer, the Guarantors and Wilmington Trust, National Association as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), the registrar (in such capacity, the “Registrar”) and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “Notes Collateral Agent”). See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuer will not be required to, nor does it currently intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register or qualify by prospectus the Notes for resale under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act or subject to the terms of the Trust Indenture Act. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture. The Issuer does not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. If the closing of this offering of the Notes occurs prior to the Acquisition Date, then, pending the satisfaction of the Escrow Conditions, the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be placed in a segregated escrow account (the “Escrow Account”). If the Escrow Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined below) (or such earlier date as the Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent (as defined below) in writing that in its reasonable judgment the Acquisition will not be consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or the Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent in writing that the Merger Agreement has been terminated), the Notes offered hereby will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption at a redemption price of 100% of the issue price of the Notes offered hereby, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below). See “—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Mandatory Redemption.” The funds in the Escrow Account will be released and applied to pay for any such redemption and any unpaid fees or expenses of the Escrow Agent, the Trustee and the other agents under the Indenture, with any excess amounts to be released to the Issuer. The following description is only a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement.

From and after the Completion Date, Parent and certain of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (as detailed below) will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer’s existing or future Foreign Subsidiaries, any direct or indirect Subsidiary that is a direct or indirect Domestic Subsidiary of a direct or indirect Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC, existing or future FSHCO Subsidiaries, any future Securitization Subsidiaries or any future Captive Insurance Subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the Notes. The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally guarantee, fully and unconditionally, on a senior secured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture or a supplement thereto. As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as described in this “Description of Notes.” Each of the Guarantees will be: - a general senior obligation of such Guarantor; - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor; - effectively senior to all existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Collateral owned by such Guarantor; - equal in priority as to the Collateral owned by such Guarantor with respect to any Equal Priority Obligations of such Guarantor, including the Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations to the extent of the value of such Collateral; - effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets; and - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the Issuer). ----- As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions: - the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had approximately $900.0 million in total indebtedness outstanding, none of which would have been subordinated and all of which would have been senior secured indebtedness, consisting of $400.0 million of term loan borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and approximately $500.0 million of the Notes; - the Issuer would have had approximately $115.0 million of availability to incur additional secured indebtedness under the revolving credit facility under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; and From and after the Completion Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries (including Cvent) are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries” unless designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Indenture. Under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our existing and future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, after intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor Subsidiaries represented approximately 26.8% of our revenues, 26.4% of our total assets and 8.9% of our total liabilities. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, such non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, will be structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness which may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-guarantor Subsidiaries. As of the Completion Date, Parent and each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that guarantees the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will guarantee the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee was rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the Indenture to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP. Each Guarantor may consolidate with, amalgamate or merge with or into or wind up into, or consummate a Division as a Dividing Person, or sell all or substantially all its assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor without limitation or any other Person upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants— Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.” Each Guarantee by a Guarantor will provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (1) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, any sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer (by merger, amalgamation, consolidation, dividend, distribution or otherwise) of (i) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, after which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a ----- Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case if such sale, exchange, issuance, disposition or transfer is made in compliance with or is not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture (including any amendments thereof); (2) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, or the release or discharge of such other guarantee or direct obligation that resulted in the creation of such Guarantee, except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment under such guarantee or direct obligation (it being understood that a release subject to a contingent reinstatement will constitute a release for the purposes of this provision, and that if any such Guarantee is so reinstated, such Guarantee shall also be reinstated to the extent that such Guarantor would then be required to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”); (3) in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor, the designation of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture or the occurrence of any event following which the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (4) upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation or Division of any Guarantor with and into the Issuer or another Guarantor or upon the liquidation or winding up of such Guarantor, in each case, in compliance with or in a manner not prohibited by the applicable provisions of the Indenture; (5) the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event; (6) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” or in accordance with the provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (7) the exercise by the Issuer of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” or the discharge of the Issuer’s obligations under the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; or (8) in the case of Parent, if Parent ceases to be the direct parent of the Issuer as a result of a transaction or designation permitted pursuant to the definition of “Parent”. Notwithstanding clause (5) above, if, after any Covenant Suspension Event, a Reversion Date shall occur, then the Suspension Period with respect to such Covenant Suspension Event shall terminate and all actions reasonably necessary to provide that the Notes shall have been unconditionally guaranteed by each Guarantor (to the extent such guarantee is required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”) shall be taken within 90 days after such Reversion Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer laws permit a court, under certain circumstances, to void the notes and the guarantees, and the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees, subordinate claims in respect of the notes, the guarantees and the liens securing the notes and the related guarantees and/or require holders of the notes to return payments received from us in respect of the guarantees and the liens and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the notes.” Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee, as specified above, the Trustee, subject to receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer and at the Issuer’s expense, will execute such documents reasonably requested by the Issuer in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Guarantee. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the notes to reflect any such release, discharge or termination.

Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement only the “Controlling Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Bank Collateral Agent and will remain the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations that are Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent (other than the initial Bank Collateral Agent) of the Series of Equal Priority Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of Equal Priority Obligations (excluding the Series of Senior Secured Credit Facility Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the “Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent”). With respect to any Shared Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall, or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral. The “Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, the date that is 120 days (throughout which 120-day period such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent was the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the Equal Priority Obligations, and (b) the Controlling Collateral Agent and each other Collateral Agent’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent is the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent and that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of Equal Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Equal Priority Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that Series of Equal Priority Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to such Shared Collateral or any portion thereof or (2) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Bank Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent will have no rights to take any action under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens with respect to the Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with the Shared Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral. Each of the Equal Priority Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the Equal Priority Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of Equal Priority Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any Equal ----- Priority Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement ) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by any Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party and proceeds of any such distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such distribution, payments or proceeds, to the paragraph immediately following) to which the Equal Priority Obligations are entitled under such other intercreditor agreement shall be applied: (A) FIRST, in payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such); and (B) SECOND, subject to the immediately following paragraph, among the Equal Priority Obligations to the payment in full of the Equal Priority Obligations on a ratable basis, with such proceeds to be applied to the Equal Priority Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable Equal Priority Documents for such Series; provided that following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor, solely as among the holders of Equal Priority Obligations and solely for purposes of this clause SECOND and not the indenture or other debt facility for the Equal Priority Obligations, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the Equal Priority Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of Equal Priority Obligations of each Series of Equal Priority Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the Equal Priority Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding. “Post-Petition Interest” for purposes of the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement means any interest or entitlement to fees or expenses or other charges that accrue after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, whether or not allowed or allowable as a claim in any such insolvency or liquidation proceeding; and (C) THIRD, after the discharge of all Equal Priority Obligations, to the Grantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same. It is the intention of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of Equal Priority Obligations of such Series (and not the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of Equal Priority Obligations), (y) any of the Equal Priority Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of Equal Priority Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of Equal Priority Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of Equal Priority Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Equal Priority Obligations permitted by the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such Equal Priority Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Equal Priority Obligations or the Equal Priority Documents governing such Equal Priority Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may institute in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared ----- Collateral. In addition, none of the Equal Priority Secured Parties may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any Equal Priority Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Equal Priority Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Equal Priority Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other Equal Priority Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other Collateral Agents for the benefit of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Holders of the Notes and each other Series of Equal Priority Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement. The Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law. _Certain Limitations Applicable in Bankruptcy Proceedings_ If the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any bankruptcy case, the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each Equal Priority Secured Party will agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) and/or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank on an equal priority basis with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the Equal Priority Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other Equal Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; (B) the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional collateral pledged to any Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the Equal Priority Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the Equal Priority Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Equal Priority Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement; and ----- (D) if any Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement ; _provided that the Equal Priority Secured Parties of each Series will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of such Series or its representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and _provided,_ _further, that the Equal Priority Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other Equal Priority Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such Equal Priority Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The Equal Priority Secured Parties acknowledge that the Equal Priority Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other Equal Priority Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the Equal Priority Secured Parties of any Series.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement\nText: The Notes Collateral Agent and the Bank Collateral Agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement (as the same may be amended from time to time or any other intercreditor agreement substantially in the form thereof, the ----- \u201cEqual Priority Intercreditor Agreement\u201d) with respect to the Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Equal Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Equal Priority Intercreditor Agreement.

Such Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement would be entered into without the consent,"of the Holders. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Junior Lien Obligations and Equal Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred under the then extant relevant agreements, or their respective representatives. Notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens granted to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral or of any Liens granted to any Equal Priority Secured Parties on the Collateral (or any actual or alleged defect in any of the foregoing) and notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, any applicable law, any Junior Lien Documents or any Equal Priority Documents or any other circumstance whatsoever, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Representative, in each case on behalf of itself and each Junior Lien Secured Party under its Junior Lien Documents, will agree that any Lien on the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Equal Priority Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Equal Priority Secured Parties or other representative, agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Junior Lien Obligations. Pursuant to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, except as provided below, prior to the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent or any person authorized by it will have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the Collateral and will also have the exclusive right to determine and direct the time, method and place for exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding with respect thereto. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement that it will not (and will waive any right to) take any action to, contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of a Lien securing, or the allowability of any claim asserted with respect to, any Equal Priority Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any of the Equal Priority Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor in any Collateral or other collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of any Collateral Agent to contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of any Lien securing, or the allowability of any claim asserted ----- with respect to, any Junior Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Collateral securing the Junior Lien Obligations. The Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such Collateral upon the exercise of remedies or in any bankruptcy proceeding will be applied to the Equal Priority Obligations prior to application to any Junior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant Equal Priority Documents until the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has occurred. In addition, so long as the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has not occurred, none of the Grantors shall grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property of any Grantor to secure any Junior Lien Obligations unless it has granted, or concurrently therewith grants, a Lien on such asset or property of such Grantor to secure the Equal Priority Obligations. If the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Party holds or acquires any Lien on any assets or property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary securing any Junior Lien Obligations that are not also subject to the senior priority Liens securing Equal Priority Obligations under the Equal Priority Documents, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or such Junior Lien Secured Party (i) will be obligated to notify the Controlling Collateral Agent promptly upon becoming aware thereof and, unless such Grantor shall promptly grant a similar Lien on such assets or property to the Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations, must assign such Lien to the Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations (but may retain a junior lien on such assets or property subject to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and (ii) until such assignment or such grant of a similar Lien to the Collateral Agents, will be deemed to also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations. Any amounts received by or distributed to any Junior Lien Secured Party pursuant to or as a result of any Lien granted in contravention of the foregoing shall be subject to the turnover and related provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party will agree that none of them shall be entitled to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, whether by preference or otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that so long as the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor, (i) neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any Junior Lien Secured Party will (x) exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or recoupment) with respect to any collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), (y) contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought with respect to the Collateral or any other collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party in respect of the Equal Priority Obligations, the exercise of any right by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party (or any agent or sub-agent on their behalf) in respect of the Equal Priority Obligations under any lockbox agreement, control agreement, landlord waiver or bailee’s letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third-party beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party of any rights and remedies relating to such collateral or any other collateral under the Equal Priority Documents or otherwise in respect of Equal Priority Obligations, or (z) object to any forbearance by the Equal Priority Secured Parties from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to such collateral or any other collateral in respect of Equal Priority Obligations and (ii) except as otherwise ----- provided in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Controlling Collateral Agent and the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall have the exclusive right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including setoff, recoupment, and the right to credit bid their debt), and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions with respect to such collateral without any consultation with or the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Party; provided, however, that (a) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, any Junior Lien Representative may file a claim, proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations in a manner consistent with the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (b) any Junior Lien Representative may take any action (not adverse to the prior Liens on the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof) in order to create, prove, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its rights in, and perfection and priority of its Lien on, the Collateral, (c) to the extent not otherwise inconsistent with or prohibited by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Lien Representative and the Junior Lien Secured Parties may exercise their rights and remedies as unsecured creditors, as provided in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (d) any Junior Lien Representative may exercise the rights and remedies provided for in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to seeking adequate protection in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding, and (e) any Junior Lien Representative and the Junior Lien Secured Parties may file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of the Junior Lien Secured Parties, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. In exercising rights and remedies with respect to any collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent and the Equal Priority Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the Equal Priority Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion. Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or otherwise dispose of Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with such sale or disposition and to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction and of a secured creditor under bankruptcy laws of any applicable jurisdiction. In the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of any specified item of Collateral (including all or substantially all of the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the Issuer), the Liens granted to the Junior Lien Representatives and the Junior Lien Secured Parties upon such Collateral to secure Junior Lien Obligations shall terminate and be released, automatically and without any further action, concurrently with the termination and release of all Liens granted upon such Collateral to secure Equal Priority Obligations. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Equal Priority Documents may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with their terms, and the Indebtedness under the Equal Priority Documents may be refinanced, in each case, without the consent of any Junior Lien Secured Party. Without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, no Junior Lien Document may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, or entered into, and no Indebtedness under the Junior Lien Document may be refinanced, to the extent such amendment, restatement, supplement or modification or refinancing, or the terms of such new Junior Lien Document, would (i) contravene the provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) change to earlier dates any scheduled dates for payment of principal (including the final maturity date) or of interest on Indebtedness under such Junior Lien Document or (iii) reduce the capacity to incur Indebtedness for borrowed money constituting Equal Priority Obligations to an amount less than the aggregate principal amount of term loans or outstanding notes and aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments, in each case, under the Equal Priority Documents on the day of any such amendment, restatement, supplement, modification or refinancing. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law. ----- _Certain Matters in Connection with Liquidation and Insolvency Proceedings_ Debtor-in-Possession Financings The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Secured Party will agree, among other things, that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party desires to permit (or not object to) the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law and/or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law to be secured by any collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, then each Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will not object to such use of cash collateral and/or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to the extent permitted by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and, to the extent the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations are subordinated to or on an equal priority basis with respect to such DIP Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral and any other collateral to such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto), any adequate protection Liens granted to the Equal Priority Secured Parties, and any “carve out” for professional and United States Trustee fees agreed to by the Controlling Collateral Agent, on the same basis as they are subordinated to the Equal Priority Obligations pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree that notice received two Business Days prior to the entry of an order approving such usage of cash or other collateral and/or approving such DIP Financing shall be adequate notice. Relief from Automatic Stay; Bankruptcy Sales No Junior Lien Secured Party may (x) seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to any Collateral without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, or object to any motion for relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Collateral made by the Controlling Collateral Agent, (y) object to any lawful exercise by any holder of Equal Priority Obligations of the right to credit bid such claims under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law, or to any sale or other disposition of any Collateral that the Controlling Collateral Agent has consented to, provided that in the case of such a sale, the parties’ respective Liens will attach to the proceeds of such sale on the same basis of priority as such Liens existed on the Collateral pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (z) object to any claim of any holder of Equal Priority Obligations for post-petition interest, fees, costs, expenses or other charges under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise (for this purpose ignoring all claims and Liens held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral). Adequate Protection Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree that none of them shall object to (a) any request by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties for adequate protection in any form, (b) any objection by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action, or proceeding based on the Controlling Collateral Agent’s or the Equal Priority Secured Parties’ claiming a lack of adequate protection, or (c) the allowance and/or payment of interest, fees, expenses, or other amounts of the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law. If the Equal Priority Secured Parties (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative expense claim in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, as applicable, or any similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law, then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative expense claim, which Lien and/or superpriority administrative expense claim (as applicable) will be subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate protection for, and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto), on the same basis as the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens ----- securing and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) in the event any Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, seek or request adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative expense claim, then such Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, agree that the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall also be granted (as applicable) a senior Lien on such additional or replacement collateral as security and adequate protection for the Equal Priority Obligations and/or a senior superpriority administrative expense claim, and that any Lien on such additional or replacement collateral securing or providing adequate protection for the Junior Lien Obligations and/or superpriority administrative expense claim shall be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and any other Liens and claims granted to the Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection on the same basis as the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations are so subordinated to such Liens securing and claims with respect to Equal Priority Obligations under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that the Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Junior Lien Representatives shall not be prohibited from seeking adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition incurred fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as applicable), subject to the right of the Equal Priority Secured Parties to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees and expenses or other cash payments so sought by the Junior Lien Secured Parties. Plans of Reorganization No Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Secured Party (whether in the capacity of a secured or unsecured creditor) may directly or indirectly propose, support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent or to the extent any such plan is proposed or supported by the class of holders of Equal Priority Obligations required under Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the Junior Lien Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Junior Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the Equal Priority Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the Equal Priority Secured Parties and the Junior Lien Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties), the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations, with each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Lien Secured Parties.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""```json\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}\n```"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Lien Intercreditor Agreement\u201d).

The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding Junior Lien Obligations and Equal Priority Obligations permitted to be incurred under the then extant relevant agreements, or their respective representatives. Notwithstanding the date, time, manner or order of filing or recordation of any document or instrument or grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens granted to the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral or of any Liens granted to any Equal Priority Secured Parties on the Collateral (or any actual or alleged defect in any of the foregoing) and notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code, any applicable law, any Junior Lien Documents or any Equal Priority Documents or any other circumstance whatsoever, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Representative, in each case on behalf of itself and each Junior Lien Secured Party under its Junior Lien Documents, will agree that any Lien on the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Equal Priority Obligations now or hereafter held by or on behalf of any Equal Priority Secured Parties or other representative, agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall have priority over and be senior in all respects and prior to any Lien on the Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Junior Lien Obligations. Pursuant to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, except as provided below, prior to the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent or any person authorized by it will have the exclusive right to exercise any right or remedy with respect to the Collateral and will also have the exclusive right to determine and direct the time, method and place for exercising such right or remedy or conducting any proceeding with respect thereto. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement that it will not (and will waive any right to) take any action to, contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of a Lien securing, or the allowability of any claim asserted with respect to, any Equal Priority Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any of the Equal Priority Secured Parties or any agent or trustee therefor in any Collateral or other collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of any Collateral Agent to contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, extent, perfection, priority or enforceability of any Lien securing, or the allowability of any claim asserted ----- with respect to, any Junior Lien Obligations held (or purported to be held) by or on behalf of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any of the Junior Lien Secured Parties in the Collateral securing the Junior Lien Obligations. The Collateral or proceeds thereof received in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such Collateral upon the exercise of remedies or in any bankruptcy proceeding will be applied to the Equal Priority Obligations prior to application to any Junior Lien Obligations in such order as specified in the relevant Equal Priority Documents until the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has occurred. In addition, so long as the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has not occurred, none of the Grantors shall grant or permit any additional Liens on any asset or property of any Grantor to secure any Junior Lien Obligations unless it has granted, or concurrently therewith grants, a Lien on such asset or property of such Grantor to secure the Equal Priority Obligations. If the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Party holds or acquires any Lien on any assets or property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary securing any Junior Lien Obligations that are not also subject to the senior priority Liens securing Equal Priority Obligations under the Equal Priority Documents, the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or such Junior Lien Secured Party (i) will be obligated to notify the Controlling Collateral Agent promptly upon becoming aware thereof and, unless such Grantor shall promptly grant a similar Lien on such assets or property to the Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations, must assign such Lien to the Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations (but may retain a junior lien on such assets or property subject to the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and (ii) until such assignment or such grant of a similar Lien to the Collateral Agents, will be deemed to also hold and have held such Lien for the benefit of the Collateral Agents as security for the Equal Priority Obligations. Any amounts received by or distributed to any Junior Lien Secured Party pursuant to or as a result of any Lien granted in contravention of the foregoing shall be subject to the turnover and related provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If any Equal Priority Secured Party is required in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any trustee, receiver or similar person therefor), because the payment of such amount was declared to be, or otherwise avoided as, fraudulent or preferential in any respect or for any other reason, any amount (a \u201cRecovery\u201d), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of setoff, recoupment or otherwise, then the Equal Priority Obligations shall be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to a future Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations with respect to all such recovered amounts. If the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties thereto. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party will agree that none of them shall be entitled to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, whether by preference or otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that so long as the Discharge of Equal Priority Obligations has not occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor, (i) neither the Junior Lien Collateral Agent nor any Junior Lien Secured Party will (x) exercise or seek to exercise any rights or remedies (including setoff or recoupment) with respect to any collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, or institute any action or proceeding with respect to such rights or remedies (including any action of foreclosure), (y) contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought with respect to the Collateral or any other collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party in respect of the Equal Priority Obligations, the exercise of any right by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party (or any agent or sub-agent on their behalf) in respect of the Equal Priority Obligations under any lockbox agreement, control agreement, landlord waiver or bailee\u2019s letter or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Equal Priority Secured Party either is a party or may have rights as a third-party beneficiary, or any other exercise by any such party of any rights and remedies relating to such collateral or any other collateral under the Equal Priority Documents or otherwise in respect of Equal Priority Obligations, or (z) object to any forbearance by the Equal Priority Secured Parties from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to such collateral or any other collateral in respect of Equal Priority Obligations and (ii) except as otherwise ----- provided in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Controlling Collateral Agent and the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall have the exclusive right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including setoff, recoupment, and the right to credit bid their debt), and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions with respect to such collateral without any consultation with or the consent of the Junior Lien Collateral Agent or any Junior Lien Secured Party; provided, however, that (a) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, any Junior Lien Representative may file a claim, proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations in a manner consistent with the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (b) any Junior Lien Representative may take any action (not adverse to the prior Liens on the Collateral securing the Equal Priority Obligations or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof) in order to create, prove, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its rights in, and perfection and priority of its Lien on, the Collateral, (c) to the extent not otherwise inconsistent with or prohibited by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any Junior Lien Representative and the Junior Lien Secured Parties may exercise their rights and remedies as unsecured creditors, as provided in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (d) any Junior Lien Representative may exercise the rights and remedies provided for in the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to seeking adequate protection in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding, and (e) any Junior Lien Representative and the Junior Lien Secured Parties may file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of the Junior Lien Secured Parties, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. In exercising rights and remedies with respect to any collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent and the Equal Priority Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the Equal Priority Documents and exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may determine in the exercise of their sole discretion. Such exercise and enforcement shall include the rights of an agent appointed by them to sell or otherwise dispose of Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur expenses in connection with such sale or disposition and to exercise all the rights and remedies of a secured lender under the Uniform Commercial Code of any applicable jurisdiction and of a secured creditor under bankruptcy laws of any applicable jurisdiction. In the event of a sale, transfer or other disposition of any specified item of Collateral (including all or substantially all of the Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the Issuer), the Liens granted to the Junior Lien Representatives and the Junior Lien Secured Parties upon such Collateral to secure Junior Lien Obligations shall terminate and be released, automatically and without any further action, concurrently with the termination and release of all Liens granted upon such Collateral to secure Equal Priority Obligations. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Equal Priority Documents may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified in accordance with their terms, and the Indebtedness under the Equal Priority Documents may be refinanced, in each case, without the consent of any Junior Lien Secured Party. Without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, no Junior Lien Document may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, or entered into, and no Indebtedness under the Junior Lien Document may be refinanced, to the extent such amendment, restatement, supplement or modification or refinancing, or the terms of such new Junior Lien Document, would (i) contravene the provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) change to earlier dates any scheduled dates for payment of principal (including the final maturity date) or of interest on Indebtedness under such Junior Lien Document or (iii) reduce the capacity to incur Indebtedness for borrowed money constituting Equal Priority Obligations to an amount less than the aggregate principal amount of term loans or outstanding notes and aggregate principal amount of revolving commitments, in each case, under the Equal Priority Documents on the day of any such amendment, restatement, supplement, modification or refinancing. The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the provisions of it are intended to be and shall be enforceable under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law. ----- _Certain Matters in Connection with Liquidation and Insolvency Proceedings_ Debtor-in-Possession Financings The Junior Lien Collateral Agent and each other Junior Lien Secured Party will agree, among other things, that if the Issuer or any Guarantor is subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Equal Priority Secured Party desires to permit (or not object to) the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law and/or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain DIP Financing under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law to be secured by any collateral securing both the Equal Priority Obligations and any Junior Lien Obligations, then each Junior Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will not object to such use of cash collateral and/or DIP Financing and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except to the extent permitted by the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement) and, to the extent the Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations are subordinated to or on an equal priority basis with respect to such DIP Financing, will subordinate its Liens in the Collateral and any other collateral to such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto), any adequate protection Liens granted to the Equal Priority Secured Parties, and any \u201ccarve out\u201d for professional and United States Trustee fees agreed to by the Controlling Collateral Agent, on the same basis as they are subordinated to the Equal Priority Obligations pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The Junior Lien Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree that notice received two Business Days prior to the entry of an order approving such usage of cash or other collateral and/or approving such DIP Financing shall be adequate notice. Relief from Automatic Stay; Bankruptcy Sales No Junior Lien Secured Party may (x) seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to any Collateral without the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent, or object to any motion for relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Collateral made by the Controlling Collateral Agent, (y) object to any lawful exercise by any holder of Equal Priority Obligations of the right to credit bid such claims under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy law, or to any sale or other disposition of any Collateral that the Controlling Collateral Agent has consented to, provided that in the case of such a sale, the parties\u2019 respective Liens will attach to the proceeds of such sale on the same basis of priority as such Liens existed on the Collateral pursuant to the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (z) object to any claim of any holder of Equal Priority Obligations for post-petition interest, fees, costs, expenses or other charges under Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise (for this purpose ignoring all claims and Liens held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties on the Collateral). Adequate Protection Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will agree that none of them shall object to (a) any request by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties for adequate protection in any form, (b) any objection by the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties to any motion, relief, action, or proceeding based on the Controlling Collateral Agent\u2019s or the Equal Priority Secured Parties\u2019 claiming a lack of adequate protection, or (c) the allowance and/or payment of interest, fees, expenses, or other amounts of the Controlling Collateral Agent or the Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise under Section 506(b) or 506(c) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law. If the Equal Priority Secured Parties (or any subset thereof) are granted adequate protection in the form of a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative expense claim in connection with any DIP Financing or use of cash collateral under Section 363 or 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, as applicable, or any similar provision of the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law, then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, may seek or request adequate protection in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on such additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative expense claim, which Lien and/or superpriority administrative expense claim (as applicable) will be subordinated to the Liens securing and providing adequate protection for, and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations and such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto), on the same basis as the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations are so subordinated to the Liens ----- securing and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) in the event any Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, seek or request adequate protection and such adequate protection is granted in the form of (as applicable) a Lien on additional or replacement collateral and/or a superpriority administrative expense claim, then such Junior Lien Representatives, for themselves and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, agree that the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall also be granted (as applicable) a senior Lien on such additional or replacement collateral as security and adequate protection for the Equal Priority Obligations and/or a senior superpriority administrative expense claim, and that any Lien on such additional or replacement collateral securing or providing adequate protection for the Junior Lien Obligations and/or superpriority administrative expense claim shall be subordinated to the Liens on such collateral securing and claims with respect to the Equal Priority Obligations and any such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and any other Liens and claims granted to the Equal Priority Secured Parties as adequate protection on the same basis as the other Liens securing and claims with respect to the Junior Lien Obligations are so subordinated to such Liens securing and claims with respect to Equal Priority Obligations under the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement. To the extent that the Equal Priority Secured Parties are granted adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments, then the Junior Lien Representatives shall not be prohibited from seeking adequate protection in the form of payments in the amount of current post-petition incurred fees and expenses, and/or other cash payments (as applicable), subject to the right of the Equal Priority Secured Parties to object to the reasonableness of the amounts of fees and expenses or other cash payments so sought by the Junior Lien Secured Parties. Plans of Reorganization No Junior Lien Representative or any other Junior Lien Secured Party (whether in the capacity of a secured or unsecured creditor) may directly or indirectly propose, support or vote in favor of any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement, other than with the prior written consent of the Controlling Collateral Agent or to the extent any such plan is proposed or supported by the class of holders of Equal Priority Obligations required under Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code. Each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, will acknowledge and agree that (a) the grants of Liens securing the Equal Priority Obligations and the Junior Lien Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens and (b) because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Junior Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the Equal Priority Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the claims of the Equal Priority Secured Parties and the Junior Lien Secured Parties in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims) under a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, then each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Junior Lien Secured Parties, will acknowledge and agree that all distributions from the Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Junior Lien Secured Parties), the Equal Priority Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses (whether or not allowed or allowable in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Collateral in respect of the Junior Lien Obligations, with each Junior Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each applicable Junior Lien Secured Party, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Controlling Collateral Agent amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Junior Lien Secured Parties.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will send (or cause to be sent) notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee and the paying agent, to each Holder of Notes to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC with the following information: (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; ----- (4) that unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be issued new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered. The unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to at least $2,000 or any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof; (7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and shall describe each such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed, or such notice or offer may be rescinded at any time in the Issuer’s sole discretion if the Issuer determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived; (8) any other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with this Change of Control covenant, that a Holder must follow; and (9) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the close of business on the tenth Business Day prior to the expiration date of the Change of Control Offer, a facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes, or a specified portion thereof, and its election to have such Notes purchased. While the Notes are in global form and the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes or withdraw such election through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law: (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by it or portions thereof validly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not validly withdrawn; and ----- (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will provide, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer (or one of its Affiliates) becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (which may include a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or any such future Indebtedness, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or such future Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or such future Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause a Securitization Facility or other financing arrangements to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Required Holders. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Change of Control Offer and the Alternate Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Change of Control\nText: The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs after the Completion Date, unless the Issuer has previously or concurrently sent a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under \u201c\u2014Optional Redemption,\u201d the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the \u201cChange of Control Offer\u201d) at a price in cash (the \u201cChange of Control Payment\u201d) equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to the right of Holders of the Notes of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date.

The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. Any Applicable Proceeds (other than any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph in excess of the Excess Proceeds Threshold will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; _provided that any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the_ second preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to whether such offer is accepted by any Holders and any amount of Applicable Proceeds offered to Holders pursuant to clause (1)(b) of the second preceding paragraph that are not accepted shall be deemed to be Declined Proceeds. When the aggregate amount of such Applicable Proceeds exceeds $110.0 million in any fiscal year (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any other Equal Priority Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral disposed of, to the holders of such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations that is, with respect to the Notes only, in an amount equal to $1,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Applicable Proceeds by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Applicable Proceeds prior to the time period that may ----- be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Applicable Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes and such other Equal Priority Obligations or Obligations secured by a Lien permitted under the Indenture on the Collateral disposed of, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or such other Equal Priority Obligations or other Obligations, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds (or Advance Portion) upon such completion). Additionally, the Issuer may, at their option, make an Asset Sale Offer using Applicable Proceeds at any time after the consummation of such Asset Sale. Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), any remaining Applicable Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Applicable Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, Guarantees and/or Security Documents (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Applicable Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Applicable Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Required Holders. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuer become a party may contain restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer are prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Asset Sales\nText: The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including, but not limited to, by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, in connection with, such Asset Sale) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Issuer at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, with respect to any Asset Sale in excess of the greater of (x) $67.5 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration for such Asset Sale, together with all other Asset Sales since the Completion Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) the greater of the principal amount and the carrying value of any liabilities (as reflected on the Issuer\u2019s or such Restricted Subsidiary\u2019s most recent consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto or, if incurred or increased subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer\u2019s or such Restricted Subsidiary\u2019s consolidated balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or increase had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined by the Issuer) of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes (other than intercompany liabilities owing to a Restricted Subsidiary being disposed of), that are (i) assumed by the transferee of any such assets (or a third party in connection with such transfer) pursuant to a written agreement which releases or indemnifies the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such liabilities or (ii) otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction; (b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted or reasonably expected by the Issuer acting in good faith to be converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received or expected to be received) or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Sale; and (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (i) $90.0 million and (ii) 40.0% of LTM EBITDA (net of any non-cash consideration converted into Cash Equivalents) at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration (or, at the Issuer\u2019s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose.

In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer are prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing Notes. In such a case, the Issuer\u2019s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or DTC’s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC’s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that the Issuer has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer’s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer’s Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). Each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. ----- Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent (nor any agent) shall be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, may determine in its sole discretion. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture or the Security Documents and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a non-consenting Holder). In the event of any Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; ----- (2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered, and if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Required Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder).

In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Directing Holder\u2019s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a \u201cVerification Covenant\u201d). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or DTC\u2019s nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or DTC\u2019s nominee and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer\u2019s Certificate certifying that the Issuer has (i) a good faith reasonable basis to believe that one or more Directing Holders were at any relevant time in breach of their Position Representation or their Verification Covenant and (ii) initiated proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holders were, at such time, in breach of their Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and nonappealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If such Officer\u2019s Certificate has been delivered to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall refrain from acting in accordance with such Noteholder Direction until such time as the Issuer provides to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, an Officer\u2019s Certificate stating that (i) such Directing Holders have satisfied their Verification Covenant or (ii) such Directing Holders have failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, and during such time the cure period with respect to any Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Directing Holder\u2019s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Holder may have offered or provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, and any related acceleration rescinded, and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event of Default, shall not be permitted to act thereon and shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction in relation to such Event of Default. If the Directing Holder has satisfied its Verification Covenant, then the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing Holder\u2019s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, shall be permitted to act in accordance with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Issuer (as described above). Each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or Officer\u2019s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation or otherwise as to the statements made therein. ----- Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent (nor any agent) shall be liable to any person for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii) any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer\u2019s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, may determine in its sole discretion. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any obligation (i) to monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder has a Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation, (iii) inquire if the Issuer will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position Representation, (iv) enforce any Verification Covenant, (v) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (vi) monitor or investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vii) otherwise make any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, upon a valid Noteholder Direction, to accelerate the Notes, such principal of and premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (6) of the first paragraph of this section, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture will provide, subject to the foregoing, that the Required Holders, by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture or the Security Documents and rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences (except if such rescission would conflict with any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of, any Note held by a non-consenting Holder). In the event of any Event of Default specified in clauses (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; (2) the requisite number of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders of the Notes unless the Holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, if applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due on or after the respective due dates expressed in an outstanding Note, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing and, if such Event of Default is in respect of clause (3), (4), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, such Holder is not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant; ----- (2) the Holders, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (5), (7) (8) or (9) of the first paragraph of this section, Directing Holders that are not in breach of a Position Representation or Verification Covenant, comprising at least 30% in the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders of the Notes have offered, and if requested, provided the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the Required Holders have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such written request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture, including those described above, the Required Holders are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, and may take any other action that is not inconsistent with any such direction received from Holders of the Notes (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any action is prejudicial to any Holder). The Indenture will provide that the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuer is required, within 20 Business Days upon becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default (unless such Default has been cured or waived within such 20-Business Day time period). The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a \u201cNotice of Default.\u201d Any Default or Event of Default resulting from the failure to deliver a notice, report or certificate under the Indenture shall cease to exist and be cured in all respects if the underlying Default or Event of Default giving rise to such notice, report or certificate requirement shall have ceased to exist and/or be cured (including pursuant to this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, each of the parties hereto agree that any court of competent jurisdiction may (x) extend or stay any grace period set forth in the Indenture prior to when any actual or alleged Default becomes an actual or alleged Event of Default or (y) stay the exercise of remedies by the Trustee or Holders contemplated by the Indenture or otherwise upon the occurrence of an actual or alleged Event of Default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), in accordance with the requirements of applicable law.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. The Issuer and Trustee take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and ----- dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Temporary Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in Global Notes). Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in a Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, NA., as operator of Clearstream, which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or ----- (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",,as_expected,2023,245,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: nan\nText: The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream is provided solely as a matter of convenience.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers\u2019 securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, NA., as operator of Clearstream, which in turn hold such interests in customers\u2019 securities accounts in the depositaries\u2019 names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of DTC). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, owners of an interest in Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of definitive notes in registered certificated form (\u201cCertificated Notes\u201d) and will not be considered the registered owners or \u201cHolders\u201d thereof under the indenture for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the persons in whose names notes, including Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC\u2019s records or any Participant\u2019s or Indirect Participant\u2019s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC\u2019s records or any Participant\u2019s or Indirect Participant\u2019s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in Global Notes; or ----- (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under \u201cTransfer Restrictions,\u201d transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC\u2019s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC\u2019s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositaries; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute those notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}",,,

This summary is based upon provisions of the Code, and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities are subject to differing interpretations and may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below.
