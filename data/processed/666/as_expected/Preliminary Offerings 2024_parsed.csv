The notes and the guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions described in this offering memorandum, substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and the guarantors (the “collateral”), which assets also secure the Credit Facilities on a first-priority basis. See “Description of notes—Security.” The notes and the guarantees will (i) rank equal in right of payment with all of the existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuers and guarantors, including indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and the SBI Bonds (as defined herein), before giving effect to collateral arrangements, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to all of the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers and guarantors, (iii) be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuers and guarantors that is secured by liens on assets that do not constitute collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets, (iv) be effectively senior to all of the existing and future indebtedness of the Issuers and guarantors that is unsecured or secured by the collateral on a junior-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the notes, (v) rank equal with all of the existing and future indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a first-lien basis, including the Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and (v) be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of each subsidiary of the Issuers and guarantors that is not a guarantor of the notes, including indebtedness under the Committed Facility, the Uncommitted Facility, the Overdraft Facility and the Short Term Facilities (each as defined herein).

Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery should consult their own advisors.

We have incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum certain information contained in various public filings of Virtu, our indirect parent company.

666,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1100,USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION,1100.1,,1100.1.1,,"In this offering memorandum, we present our Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted Net Trading Income per day, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes, Normalized Adjusted EPS, Operating Margins and Adjusted Operating Expenses (each as defined below). These are non-U.S. GAAP (“Non-GAAP”) financial measures of financial performance that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure. - “Adjusted Net Trading Income” is the amount of revenue we generate from our market-making activities, or trading income, net, plus commissions, net and technology services, plus interest and dividends income, less direct costs associated with those revenues, including brokerage, exchange, clearance fees and payments for order flow, net, and interest and dividends expense. Management believes that this measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Although we use Adjusted Net Trading Income as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business, the use of Adjusted Net Trading Income is limited because it does not include certain material costs that are necessary to operate our business. Our presentation of Adjusted Net Trading Income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by revenues or expenses that are not directly associated with our core business activities. For a reconciliation of Trading income, net to Adjusted Net Trading Income, see footnote 1 under the caption “Summary—Summary historical consolidated financial and other data.” “Adjusted Net Trading Income per day” is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Trading Income by the number of trading days in the respective period. - “EBITDA” measures our operating performance by adjusting net income to exclude financing interest expense on long-term borrowings, debt issue cost related to debt refinancing, prepayment and commitment fees, depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles and acquired capitalized software, and income tax expense, and “Adjusted EBITDA” measures our operating performance by further adjusting EBITDA to exclude severance, transaction advisory fees and expenses, termination of office leases, charges related to share based compensation and other expenses, which includes reserves for legal matters and other, net, which includes gains and losses from strategic investments, the sales of businesses, and other income. For a reconciliation of Net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA see footnote 1 under the caption “Summary— Summary historical consolidated financial and other data.” - “Normalized Adjusted Net Income,” “Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes” and “Normalized provision for income taxes” are calculated by adjusting net income to exclude certain items and other non-cash items, assuming that all vested and unvested Virtu Financial Units have been exchanged for Class A Common Stock, and applying an effective tax rate, which was approximately 24%. For a reconciliation of Net income to Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes and Normalized Adjusted EPS, see footnote 3 under the caption “Summary—Summary historical consolidated financial and other data.” - “Operating Margins” are calculated by dividing net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Adjusted Net Trading Income. - “Adjusted Operating Expenses” are calculated by adjusting total operating expenses to exclude severance, share v ----- based compensation, reserves for legal matters, termination of office leases, connectivity early termination and write-down of assets. For a reconciliation of certain operating expenses to Adjusted Cash Compensation, Adjusted Communication & Data Processing, Adjusted Operations & Administrative, Adjusted Cash Operating Expenses and Total Adjusted Operating Expenses, see footnote 6 under the caption “Summary—Summary historical consolidated financial and other data.” Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted Net Trading Income per day, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes, Normalized Adjusted EPS, Operating Margins and Adjusted Operating Expenses (collectively, the “Company’s Non-GAAP Measures”) are non-GAAP financial measures used by management in evaluating operating performance and in making strategic decisions. In addition, the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures or similar Non-GAAP financial measures are used by research analysts, investment bankers and lenders to assess our operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and cash flows because they assist both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. The Company’s Non-GAAP Measures provide indicators of general economic performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that these measurements are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period. Furthermore, the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below) and the Indenture will contain covenants and other tests based on metrics similar to Adjusted EBITDA. Other companies may define Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted Net Trading Income per day, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes, Operating Margins and Adjusted Operating Expenses differently, and as a result the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies. Although we use the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures as financial measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because they do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business. The Company’s Non-GAAP Measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, Net Income in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of the Company’s NonGAAP Measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. The Company’s Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - our EBITDA-based measures do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and our EBITDA-based measures do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and - they do not reflect limitations on our costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us. Because of these limitations, the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures are not intended as alternatives to Net income as indicators of our operating performance or our most comparable or U.S. GAAP measurements and should vi ----- not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. These U.S. GAAP measurements include operating Net Income, operating expenses, cash flows from operations and cash flow data. The calculation of our EBITDA-based measures may also differ from the calculation of “Consolidated EBITDA” (or similar measures) for purposes of the Indenture, our Credit Facilities (as defined below) or the agreements governing our other indebtedness. See “Description of notes.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,161
666,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,233,SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,233.1,,233.1.1,,"This offering memorandum, as well as our public documents and statements, contain forward-looking statements that are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms “may,” “will,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology and expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this offering memorandum and our public documents and statements, you should understand that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum and our public documents and statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading “Risk factors” in this offering memorandum and “Risk Factors” in each of our Annual Report and Quarterly Report, because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Although we believe that the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum and our Annual Report and Quarterly Report are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors, including those described under the heading “Risk factors” in this offering memorandum and “Risk Factors” in each of our Annual Report and Quarterly Report, could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and cash flows, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: - volatility in levels of overall trading activity; - dependence upon trading counterparties, clients and clearing houses performing their obligations to us; - failures of our customized trading platform; - risks inherent to the electronic market making business and trading generally; - recent SEC rule proposals focused on equity markets may, if adopted, materially change U.S. equity market structure, including by reducing overall trading volumes, reducing off-exchange trading and market-making opportunities, requiring additional tools, platforms and services to register as an alternative trading system (“ATS”) or exchange, and generally increasing the implicit and explicit cost as well as the complexity of the U.S. equities eco-system for all participants, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business; - additionally, enhanced regulatory, congressional, and media scrutiny, including attention to electronic trading, wholesale market making and off-exchange trading, payment for order flow, and other market structure topics may result in additional potential changes in regulation or law which could have an adverse effect on our business as well as adversely impact the public's perception of us or of companies in our industry; vii ----- - increased competition in market-making activities and execution services; - dependence on continued access to sources of liquidity; - risks associated with self-clearing and other operational elements of our business, including but not limited to risks related to funding and liquidity;

666,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,Market Making,"Our Market Making segment principally consists of market making in the cash, futures, and options markets across global equities, fixed income, currencies, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. As a leading, low cost market maker dedicated to improving efficiency and providing liquidity across multiple asset classes and geographies, we aim to provide critical market functionality and robust price competition in the securities and other financial instruments in which we provide liquidity. The scale and diversity of our market-making activities provide added liquidity and transparency to the financial markets, which we believe are necessary and valuable components to the efficient functioning of markets and benefit all market participants. We support transparent and efficient, technologically advanced marketplaces, and advocate for legislation and regulation that promotes fair and transparent access to the financial markets. As a market maker, we commit capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions. We engage in principal trading in the Market Making segment direct to clients as well as in a supplemental capacity on exchanges, ATSs and other market centers. As a complement to electronic market making, our cash trading business handles specialized orders and transacts on the OTC Link ATS operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. We make markets in a number of different asset classes. We register as market makers and liquidity providers where available and support affirmative market-making obligations. We provide competitive and deep liquidity that helps to create more efficient markets around the world. We stand ready, at any time, to buy or sell a broad range of securities and other financial instruments, and we generate revenue by buying and selling large volumes of securities and other financial instruments while earning small bid/ask spreads. We believe the overall level of volumes and realized volatility as well as the attractiveness of the order flow we interact with and the level of retail participation in the various markets we serve have the greatest impact on our businesses. Increases in market volatility can cause bid/ask spreads to temporarily widen as market participants are more willing to transact immediately and as a result market makers’ capture rate per notional amount transacted increases. Technology is at the core of our business. Our team of in-house software engineers develops our software and applications, and we utilize optimized infrastructure to integrate directly with the exchanges and other trading venues on which we provide liquidity. Our focus on technology and our ability to leverage our technology enables us to be one of the lowest cost providers of liquidity to the global electronic trading marketplace. Leveraging the scalability and low costs of our platform, we are able to test and rapidly deploy new liquidity provisioning strategies, expand to new securities, asset classes and geographies and increase transaction volumes at little incremental cost. These efficiencies are central to our ability to deliver consistently positive Adjusted Net Trading Income as our profitability per trade and per instrument is not significant, particularly in U.S. equities. Our transaction processing is automated over the full life cycle of a trade. Our market-making platform generates and disseminates continuous bid and offer quotes. At the moment when a trade is executed, our systems capture and deliver this information back to the source, in most cases within a fraction of a second, and the trade record is written into our clearing system, where it flows through a chain of control accounts that allow us to automatically and efficiently reconcile trades, positions and payments until the final settlement occurs. 2 ----- We have built and continuously refine our automated and integrated, real time systems for global trading, risk management, clearing and cash management, among other purposes. We have also assembled a proprietary connectivity network between us and exchanges around the world. Efficiency and speed in performing prescribed functions are always crucial requirements for our systems, and generally we focus on opportunities in markets that are sufficiently advanced to allow the seamless deployment of our automated strategies, risk management system and core technology. Our core operations team across our offices in North America, APAC and Europe monitors our systems 24 hours a day, five days a week. This function provides coverage for our full technology platform, including our market data, order routing, transaction processing, and risk management technology modules.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

We engage regularly with regulators around the world on issues affecting electronic trading and other matters that may affect our business and the operation of the financial 1 ----- markets and advocate for increased transparency.

As of March 31, 2024, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had an aggregate of $1,745 million outstanding indebtedness under our long-term borrowings. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Additionally, we are party to (i) the $400.0 million Uncommitted Facility under which we had $80.0 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2024, (ii) the $650.0 million Committed Facility under which we had $50.0 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and (ii) the $10.0 million Overdraft Facility under which we had $10.0 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2024. Additionally, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2024, and expect to have no borrowings outstanding under our Extended Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date. Also, certain of our non-guarantor subsidiaries are party to various short-term credit facilities with various prime brokers and other financial institutions in an aggregate amount of approximately $598.2 million under which we had approximately $170.7 million in borrowings outstanding at March 31, 2024. The credit agreement governing the Credit Facilities (the “Credit Agreement”) and the Indenture will contain and any other existing or future indebtedness of ours may contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: - incur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity interests; - pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our equity interests or make other restricted payments; - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; - make loans or certain investments; - sell certain assets; - consolidate, merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; - create liens on certain assets; - enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and - designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. 18 ----- As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to successfully execute our strategy, engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. In addition, if the usage under our Extended Revolving Credit Facility exceeds a specified level, the Extended Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a specified net first lien leverage ratio, which may require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. We may be unable to remain in compliance with the financial maintenance and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, and our obligation to comply with these covenants may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. A failure to comply with the covenants under the Credit Agreement, the notes or any of our other future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any such event of default has occurred and is continuing, the lenders under our Credit Agreement, among other things: - will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us; - could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or - could effectively prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes, any of which could result in an event of default under the notes or cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we default on our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operation could suffer a material adverse effect. We will pledge substantially all of our and our guarantor subsidiaries’ assets as collateral under the Credit Agreement and the notes. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders under the Credit Agreement and, subject to certain intercreditor arrangements, the holders of the notes, could proceed to exercise remedies against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If any of our outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, the notes or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. We do not have sufficient working capital to satisfy our debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a significant part of our outstanding indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

Although the terms of the Indenture and the Credit Agreement will contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition to the notes and our borrowings under the Credit Facilities, the covenants under any other existing or future debt instruments could allow us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness and, subject to certain limitations, such additional indebtedness could be secured on a pari passu basis with the notes. Additionally, our governing documents do not contain any limitations on the amount of debt we may incur, and we do not have a formal policy limiting the amount of debt we may incur in the future. The more leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn our security holders, will be exposed to certain risks described above under “—We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could negatively impact our business and financial condition, and our debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

However, these limitations are subject to a number 19 ----- of exceptions, including certain exceptions based on a calculation of our net income, equity issuances, receipt of capital contributions and return on certain investments subsequent to the date of the offering, as well as exceptions to accommodate our structure as an “Up-C,” including exceptions for certain tax distributions to Virtu.

If we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from future operations, we may have to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or seek to obtain additional financing.","We expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and the amounts due under the notes and our other indebtedness primarily from operations. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these payments thus depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our being unable to pay amounts due under our outstanding indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, such as future capital expenditures. If we do not have sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then-existing indebtedness (including the notes), sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including the Indenture, may restrict us from adopting any of these activities. Any failure to make scheduled payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could negatively impact our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could materially adversely affect the value of the notes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to pay the amounts due under the notes and our other indebtedness. In addition, if we are unable to meet our obligations under the notes, the holders of the notes would have the right to cause the entire principal amount of the notes to become immediately due and payable. If the amounts outstanding under our debt instruments are accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets will be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to holders of our indebtedness, including holders of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

If interest rates continue to increase, our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming an aggregate principal balance of $1,745 million is outstanding under our Amended Credit Facilities at March 31, 2024 on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, a 1% increase in the interest rate we are charged on the Amended Credit Facilities would have increased our annual interest expense by $1.7 million. We have entered into, and in the future may continue to enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous or may create additional risks. 20 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

This increased cost could make future financing by us more costly, as well as lower our current period earnings. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161
666,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our indebtedness and the notes,13.1.7,Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the notes.,"Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when they become due and include many subjective factors. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the value of the notes. Also, these credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the notes. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating. Our credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time, and such ratings may be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if, in that rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. On May 2, 2024, the Issuer’s ratings, including its corporate family rating, issuer rating and backed senior secured bank credit facility rating, were placed on review for downgrade by Moody’s. On June 4, 2024, Moody’s downgraded all such ratings. Our credit ratings may not reflect all of the factors that would be important to holders of the notes. Actual or anticipated changes or further downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the value of the notes, may increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our ability to incur additional debt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit rating agencies also evaluate our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall view of our industry. We cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on the notes. A negative change in our ratings would have a negative impact on the trading prices of the notes, liquidity in trading of the notes and on our ability to secure future debt financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell the notes.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the issuance of the notes and the delivery of guarantees related to the notes and the related security interests could be avoided as fraudulent transfers or conveyances if a court determined that the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, at the time it issued the notes, or any of the guarantors, at the time it delivered the applicable guarantee (or, in some jurisdictions, at the time payment became due under the notes or a guarantee thereof), - issued the notes or provided the applicable guarantee, as the case may be, with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes or providing such guarantee, as the case may be, and - it was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance or provision, or - it was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or - it intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. In addition, any payment by the debtors or guarantors under the notes or guarantee of the notes could be voided and required to be returned to the debtors or such guarantors, as the case may be, or deposited in a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the debtor or guarantors. Among other things, a payment could potentially be voided if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received in a distribution under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”) in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or its guarantee or the related security interest if we or a guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes and/or such guarantee. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuers’ benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether any fraudulent transfer has occurred, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether the Issuers or the guarantors was solvent at the relevant time which, if applicable in a particular jurisdiction, may be when payment became due under the notes or a guarantee. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed solvent on that date, or that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be avoided or subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, however, a debtor or a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets, - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable 22 ----- liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature, or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds unenforceable for any other reason the notes or a guarantee (or the related security interest), your claims against the Issuers or the relevant guarantor would be eliminated or limited and you would lose the right to enforce or otherwise benefit from the applicable security interest. To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds the notes or the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, your claims under the notes and related guarantees could be effectively subordinated to our other secured debt. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts already received from the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or such guarantor. Further, the avoidance of the notes and/or a related guarantee could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt that, in turn, could result in acceleration of such debt. In certain circumstances, a court may subordinate claims in respect of the notes and/or a guarantee to all other debts of the Issuers or the guarantors, or take other actions detrimental to the noteholders, based on equitable or other grounds. We cannot be certain as to the standards that a court might apply and whether it might find such subordination or other actions appropriate. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer laws or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless. Even if the guarantees of the notes remain in force, the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantee may not be sufficient to pay the notes in full when due.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

The guarantees, however, are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. In addition, guarantees provided after the issue date of the notes may be especially subject to challenge as an avoidable preference under certain circumstances. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to zero, depending on (among other things) the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Furthermore, under the circumstances discussed above, a court under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantors. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in such company’s corporate interests, the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company or which is entered into within a certain period prior to insolvency or bankruptcy, may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a guarantor, a creditor of a guarantor or the insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of a guarantor may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that the applicable court may determine the guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event that any guarantees are deemed invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the notes could be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable guarantor or you would no longer have any claim against the applicable guarantor.

Accordingly, the collateral agent for the notes may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral. Also, under the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of any collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of first-priority obligations and promptly transfer such collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations. See “Description of notes— Security—Intercreditor agreement.” The collateral securing the notes on a first-priority basis will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the authorized representative of the lenders under the Credit Facilities or, if the Credit Facilities have been discharged, the authorized representative for the series of first-priority lien obligations representing the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first priority lien on the collateral, during any period that such authorized representative controls actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes as well as the ability of the collateral agent for the notes to realize or foreclose on such collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

In addition, certain assets will be excluded from the collateral.","The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the collateral as of the date of this offering memorandum equals or exceeds the principal amount of all of the debt secured thereby on a 29 ----- first-priority basis (including the obligations under the Credit Facilities). The value of the assets pledged as collateral for the notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by noteholders from the sale of the collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the notes and the other obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of our unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and all other obligations secured by liens on the collateral that are not junior to the liens securing the notes, interest, fees and expenses may cease to accrue on the notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. See “—If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value from the collateral.” The security interest of the collateral agent for the notes will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent for the notes may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the collateral agent for the notes will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the collateral agent for the notes may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral may significantly decrease. In addition, the collateral securing the notes will be subject to other liens permitted under the Indenture, whether arising on or after the date the notes are issued, such as liens securing purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and assets subject to such liens will in certain circumstances be excluded from the collateral. Such liens may be senior to or pari passu with the lien of the noteholders. The existence of any permitted liens could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes, as well as the ability of the collateral agent for the notes to realize or foreclose on such collateral. Furthermore, not all of the Issuers’ and guarantors’ assets will secure the notes. See “Description of notes—Security.” For example, the collateral will not include, among other things: - fee-owned real property with a fair market value of less than $10 million or that is located in a federally designated flood zone and all leasehold interests in real Property; - motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title or ownership (to the extent that a security interest in such asset cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing statement); - commercial tort claims or letter of credit rights having a value of less than $10 million (to the extent that a security interest in such asset cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing statement); - those assets over which the pledging or granting of security interests in such assets would be prohibited by applicable law, rule, regulation or certain contractual obligations (in each case, except to the extent such prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code); - leases, licenses or other agreements, to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would violate or invalidate such lease, license or agreement or create a right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (in each case, except to the extent such prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code); - the assets of the broker-dealer subsidiaries, including any assets owned by Virtu Financial BD LLC, Virtu Americas LLC, Virtu ITG LLC, Virtu Financial Capital Markets, Virtu Financial Ireland Limited, and any other subsidiary where the pledging of such entity’s assets, or the entity’s guarantee of the obligations of another person, would negatively affect the entity’s compliance with applicable capital requirements, although the equity interests of such entities will, to the extent not themselves owned by such a regulated entity, be treated as 30 ----- collateral; or - certain other assets. Some of these assets may be material to us and such exclusion could have a material adverse effect on the value of the collateral. To the extent that the claims of the noteholders exceed the value of the assets securing the notes and other obligations secured on a _pari passu basis with the notes, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of any of our unsecured senior indebtedness. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the notes and other obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the notes is less than the value of the claims of the noteholders and such other obligations, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are also paid in full.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

Applicable law provides that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. Certain security interests in the collateral may not be in place on the date of the closing of this offering. The liens on certain collateral securing the notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the notes if the collateral agent for the notes is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect such liens on or prior to the date of the closing of this offering. We will be required to file or cause to be filed financing statements under the Uniform Commercial Code to perfect the security interests that can be perfected by such filings. We and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the noteholders in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements, delivery of certain stock certificates and instruments, if permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, and filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the U.S. Copyright Office, as applicable, and other perfection actions required by the security documents. We will be required to have all security interests that are required to be perfected by the security documents to be in place within a specified period of time after the date of the closing of this offering. Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may negatively impact the value of the collateral. Even if we and/or the collateral agent for the notes do take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests on collateral acquired in the future, any such security interests that are perfected after the date of the Indenture would (as described further herein) remain at risk of being avoided under certain circumstances as a preferential transfer or otherwise in any bankruptcy; to the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not perfected on the date of the closing of this offering, such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer or otherwise, which could impact the value of the collateral. See “—If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value from the collateral” below. The Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the notes will not require us to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the collateral agent for the notes for the benefit of the noteholders. As a result of these limitations, the security interest of the collateral agent for the notes for the benefit of the noteholders in a portion of the collateral may not be perfected or enforceable (or may be subject to other liens) under applicable law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may 31 ----- be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of physical collateral, if permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, or the execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust. Applicable law provides that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, certain intellectual property and other property and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The collateral agent for the notes will not monitor and has no obligation to monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the collateral agent for the notes of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the collateral agent for the notes, as applicable, against third parties. Even if the collateral agent for the notes does take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests on collateral acquired in the future, any such security interests that are perfected after the date of the Indenture would (as described further herein) remain at risk of being avoided under certain circumstances as a preferential transfer or otherwise in any bankruptcy even after the security interests perfected on the date of the closing of this offering were no longer subject to such risk.

For example, the collateral agent for the notes may need to obtain the consent of third parties or make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the noteholders will not be entitled to the collateral or any recovery with respect to the collateral. The collateral agent for the notes may not be able to obtain any such consent. Further, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such collateral. Accordingly, the collateral agent for the notes may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure or other auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral.

666,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to the collateral,13.2.8,"If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value from the collateral.","The right of the collateral agent for the notes to foreclose upon, repossess, and dispose of the collateral during the continuance of an event of default under the Indenture is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against an Issuer or a guarantor before the collateral agent for the notes repossessed and disposed of the collateral. Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the collateral agent for the notes is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of collateral previously repossessed from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given under the circumstances. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use cash and other collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of a secured creditor’s interest in its collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement collateral if and at such times as the bankruptcy court in its discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: - whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case by an Issuer or a guarantor, or the length of any delay in making such payments; - whether or when the collateral agent for the notes could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral; - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition; or - whether or to what extent noteholders would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement for “adequate protection.” Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require permission from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances). Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on debt which is to be paid first out of the proceeds of the collateral, the noteholders would hold a secured claim only to the extent of the value of the collateral to which the noteholders are entitled and an unsecured claim with respect to any shortfall. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code only permits the payment and accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees 33 ----- or “adequate protection” to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of its collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the collateral, and such amounts would not be permitted to be paid if the collateral value is not sufficient. Also, the Intercreditor Agreement will impose various limitations on the noteholders with respect to their rights to object to proposed debtor-in-possession financing or the use of cash collateral that has been consented to by the lenders under the Credit Agreement.

If the grantor of such security interest or such guarantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy case after the date of the closing of this offering, any security interest in collateral or any guarantees delivered after the date of the closing of this offering would face a greater risk than security interests or guarantees in place on the date of the closing of this offering of being avoided by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors as a preference under bankruptcy law if certain events or circumstances exist or occur. Specifically, security interests or guarantees issued after the date of the closing of this offering may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure or guarantee previously existing indebtedness. Any future pledge of collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the noteholders, including pursuant to security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued, may be avoidable as a preference if, among other circumstances, (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits the noteholders to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given, and (iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period for “insiders.” Accordingly, if an Issuer or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the date of the closing of this offering of the notes and (i) any liens granted after the date of the closing of this offering had been perfected, or (ii) any guarantees issued after the date of the closing of this offering had been issued, less than 90 days (or in some cases one year) before commencement of such bankruptcy case, such liens or guarantees are more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the date of the closing of this offering.

Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the noteholders would be limited to the value of the collateral. The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the noteholders to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes. 34 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

In addition, the New Term Loan Facility will require us to prepay the outstanding Term Loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: 39 ----- - 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% or 0% based on certain net first lien leverage ratio tests set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement) of our quarterly excess cash flow, to be defined in manner that is substantially consistent with the Existing Credit Facilities; - 100% (which percentage will be reduced to 50% or 0% based on certain net first lien leverage tests set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement) of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales and other dispositions of property, including casualty events, in each case subject to certain reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions; and - 100% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted under the Amended Credit Agreement. We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under Amended Credit Facilities at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, except in connection with a repricing event in respect of the Term Loans as described below, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to SOFR loans. Any prepayment or refinancing of Term Loans through the issuance of certain debt or any repricing amendment, in either case, that constitutes a “repricing transaction” applicable to the Term Loans resulting in a lower yield occurring at any time prior to the six-month anniversary of the Term Loan Closing Date will be accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium. _Collateral and guarantors_ All obligations under the Amended Credit Facilities will be unconditionally guaranteed by Virtu Financial and each of our existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, including exceptions for our broker-dealer subsidiaries and certain immaterial subsidiaries.

Subject to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, such security interests consist of a first-priority lien with respect to the collateral securing the Amended Credit Facilities. _Restrictive covenants and other matters_ If the usage under our Extended Revolving Credit Facility exceeds a specified level at the end of any fiscal quarter, the Extended Revolving Credit Facility will require us to maintain a maximum net first lien leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.0 as of the end of such fiscal quarter.

In addition, the Collateral will not include the_ property and assets of any of our Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor. The Issuers, the Guarantors, the trustee and the collateral agent will enter into each of the Collateral Documents defining the terms of the security interests that secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In connection therewith the Issuers and the Guarantors shall: (1) take all actions required under the indenture or Collateral Documents in order to cause the collateral agent (for the benefit of the collateral agent, the trustee and the holders of the Notes) to have valid and perfected Liens on the Collateral that are pari passu in priority with the Issuers’ other First Lien Obligations, if any, subject to Permitted Liens; (2) take such further action and execute and deliver such other documents specified in the Indenture Documents or as otherwise may be reasonably requested by the trustee or collateral agent to give effect to the foregoing; and (3) deliver to the trustee and the collateral agent an Opinion of Counsel that (i) such Collateral Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuers and the Guarantors and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors, subject to customary qualifications and limitations, and (ii) the Collateral Documents create valid and perfected Liens on the Collateral covered thereby, subject to Permitted Liens and customary qualifications and limitations. So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms and conditions, the Issuers and the Guarantors will be entitled to remain in possession and retain exclusive control over the Collateral, to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral, to invest and dispose of any income therefrom and to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to the terms of the applicable Collateral Documents: (1) all rights of the Issuers and the Guarantors to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral will cease and such cash dividends, interest and other payments will be paid to the collateral agent; (2) all voting or other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral will become vested solely in the collateral agent and the right of the Issuers and the Guarantors to exercise any such voting and consensual rights will cease in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents; and (3) the collateral agent may distribute or sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents. The Liens created by the indenture and the Collateral Documents to secure the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without the need for any further action by any Person, upon (1) the full and final payment and performance of the Obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under the indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees; (2) legal or covenant defeasance pursuant to the provisions set forth under the caption “—Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance” or discharge of the indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under the caption “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; or (3) the consent of holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. 48 ----- In addition, the collateral agent will release automatically, without the need for any further action by any Person, from the Liens securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees created by the Collateral Documents: (1) Collateral that is sold, transferred, disbursed or otherwise disposed of to a Person other than an Issuer or a Guarantor to the extent such sale, transfer, disbursement or disposition is not prohibited by the provisions of the indenture; _provided that any products or proceeds received by an Issuer or a Guarantor in respect of any such Collateral shall continue to constitute Collateral to the extent required by the indenture and the Collateral Documents; (2) the property and assets of a Guarantor upon the release of such Guarantor from its Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the indenture; (3) any property or asset of an Issuer or a Guarantor that is or becomes Excluded Property; and (4) to the extent, if any, required by the Intercreditor Agreement; _provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of the indenture or the Collateral Documents, except as_ provided in clause (4) above, Liens securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees on all or substantially all of the Collateral may be released only pursuant to the terms of the previous paragraph. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, whenever the trustee or collateral agent is asked to execute a release, the Issuers shall deliver an Opinion of Counsel and Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent to such release in the Indenture Documents have been complied with and such release is permitted by the Indenture Documents. Certain security interests in the Collateral may not be in place on the date of the indenture or may not be perfected on the date of the indenture or the date of acquisition in the future. For example, some of the instruments and other documents required to perfect a security interest may not be delivered and/or, if applicable, recorded on or prior to such date. To the extent any such security interest is not perfected by such date, the Issuers and the Guarantors will use their commercially reasonable efforts to perform all acts and things that may be required, including obtaining any required consents from third parties, to have all security interests in the Collateral duly created and enforceable and perfected, to the extent required by the Collateral Documents, promptly following the date of the indenture or acquisition (but within 90 days following the Issue Date). See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the collateral—Security over some of the collateral may not be in place on the date of the closing of this offering or may not be perfected on such date, and any unresolved issues may impact the value of the collateral. Rights in the collateral may be materially and adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in collateral now or in the future.” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to the collateral—The security interests of the noteholders in after-acquired assets may not be perfected in a timely manner or at all.” In addition, the Issuers and the Guarantors will not be required to: (a) cause the collateral agent (or its bailee) to have possession of instruments or tangible chattel paper that does not exceed $10.0 million; (b) provide the collateral agent with control agreements or other control or similar arrangements with respect to deposit accounts, securities accounts, letter of credit rights or other assets which are required to or may be perfected by control (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, possession); or (c) obtain landlord lien waivers, estoppels and collateral access letters. Further, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall not be required to make any filings or take any actions in any jurisdiction outside the United States (or otherwise enter into any security agreements, mortgages or pledge agreements governed by the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States) in respect of the Collateral. No appraisals of any Collateral have been prepared in connection with this offering of Notes. The value of the Collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers for the Collateral. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay any of the Issuers’ Obligations under the Notes or any of the Guarantors’ Obligations under the Note Guarantees, in full or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the notes. In addition, certain assets will be excluded from the collateral.” 49 ----- In addition, because a portion of the Collateral may consist of pledges of a portion of the Equity Interests of certain of our Foreign Subsidiaries, the validity of those pledges under applicable foreign law, and the ability of the holders of Notes to realize upon that Collateral under applicable foreign law, to the extent applicable, may be limited by such law, which limitations may or may not affect such Liens. If the net proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the other First Lien Obligations, including the Senior Credit Facilities, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the remaining assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the collateral—In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers or any of the guarantors, noteholders may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of the collateral and the related guarantees.” The Issuers and the Guarantors will be able to incur other Indebtedness in the future, which may be secured by the Collateral, and the Issuers may incur other First Lien Obligations in the future. The amount of such additional Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants described under “—Certain covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Certain covenants—Liens.” The amount of such additional Indebtedness could be significant. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the notes—Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured debt, which could intensify the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

666,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.6,Security,124.6.4,Intercreditor agreement,"On the Issue Date, each of the trustee and the collateral agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”), on behalf of itself and the other Notes Secured Parties, with the Senior Credit Facility Agent, on behalf of itself and Senior Credit Facility Secured Parties. The Intercreditor Agreement will, among other things, define the relative rights and related matters of the First Lien Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral. The following description is a summary of the principal terms that are expected to be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, rather than a complete and definitive description of such terms. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The “Applicable Collateral Agent” means (i) until the earlier of (x) the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Senior Credit Facility Agent and (ii) from and after the earlier of (x) the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Additional First Lien Collateral Agent holding the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations represented by the Major NonControlling Authorized Representative. The Applicable Collateral Agent will initially be the Senior Credit Facility Agent and the collateral agent will have no rights to take any action under the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until it becomes the Applicable Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the trustee and each other Authorized Representative or any other First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such First Lien Secured Party; (ii) the trustee and each other Authorized Representative or any other First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) the trustee and each other Authorized Representative or any First Lien Secured Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. With respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall act only on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to follow any instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (or any other First Lien Secured Party other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) and (iii) no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall, or shall instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under any First Lien Security Document, applicable law or otherwise. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing each Series of First Lien Obligations, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Applicable Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Applicable Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) question or contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the perfection, priority, 51 ----- validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties on all or any part of the Shared Collateral, or the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Applicable Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of either Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any First Lien Secured Party or received by the Applicable Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such distribution, proceeds, or payment, to the immediately following sentence and the second following paragraph) (all such payments, proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Collateral and all proceeds of any such distribution being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any documents governing First Lien Obligations; _provided that following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to any Issuer_ or Guarantor, solely as among the holders of First Lien Obligations and solely for purposes of the applicable waterfall provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and not any documents governing First Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral upon which a third party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a Lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or Proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such impairment exists. Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any Series of First Lien Obligations granted on the Shared Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of the Uniform Commercial Code of any jurisdiction, or any other applicable law or the First Lien Documents or any defect or deficiencies in the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations of any Series or any other circumstance whatsoever (but, in each case, subject to the immediately following paragraph), each First Lien Secured Party will agree that the Liens securing each Series of First Lien Obligations on any Shared Collateral shall be of equal priority. It is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); provided that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to mortgaged property which applies to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Lien Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the 52 ----- rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the First Lien Documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may (i) challenge or question in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding) the validity or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of any Series or any First Lien Security Document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under any First Lien Security Document or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared Collateral by the Applicable Collateral Agent, (iii) except as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement, have a right to (A) direct the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to any Shared Collateral (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement) or (B) consent to the exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party of any right, remedy or power with respect to any Shared Collateral, (iv) institute in any suit, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or other proceeding any claim against the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral, (v) seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshalled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral and (vi) attempt, directly or indirectly, to challenge the enforceability of any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to enforce the Intercreditor Agreement. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any First Lien Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the Applicable Collateral Agent for the benefit of the trustee and the holders of the Notes and each other Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement will continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, any other Bankruptcy Law or similar law by or against Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if any Issuer or Guarantor becomes subject to a case under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable Bankruptcy Law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law, each First Lien Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or authorized representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will agree that it will raise no objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless an Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral 53 ----- for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), in each case so long as: (A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case; (B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement; (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure_ the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or their Authorized Representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and _provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral. The First Lien Secured Parties will acknowledge that the First Lien Obligations of any Series may be refinanced, increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, modified, defeased, amended, supplemented, restructured, repaid or refunded (in whole or in part) all without affecting the priority of claims and application of Proceeds set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuers will offer a change of control payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased _plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Issuers at such time have given notice of redemption with respect to all outstanding Notes as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will send, electronically or by first class mail, a notice to each holder, with a copy to the trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase Notes on the change of control payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent (other than as may be required by law), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below (in which case the expected repurchase date will be stated and may be based on a date relative to the closing of the transaction that is expected to result in the Change of Control Triggering Event and which may be tolled until the closing of such transaction), in each case, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance. On the change of control payment date, the Issuers will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the change of control payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuers. Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraphs will have the status of notes issued and outstanding. The paying agent will promptly transmit to each holder of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn the change of control payment for such Notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; _provided that any such new notes will be in denominations of $2,000 and integral 56 ----- multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuers will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the change of control payment date. The provisions described above that require the Issuers to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of the Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made, and such Change of Control Offer is otherwise made in compliance with the provisions of this covenant. The closing date of any such Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be changed to conform to the actual closing date of the Change of Control. Additionally, the Issuers may, at their option, include in any Change of Control Offer an early tender payment, early consent payment or consent payment, so long as any such payment is in addition to the purchase price set forth in the initial paragraph of this section. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of redemption for all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations described below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “— Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants— Liens.” Such restrictions in the indenture can be waived only with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The occurrence of a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default under our Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facility we may enter into from time to time. Our future Indebtedness may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuers to purchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuers. If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuers will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Offer purchase price for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the notes—We may be unable to finance a change of control offer.” The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Holdings and its 57 ----- Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuers to repurchase their Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions in the indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash: (a) any liabilities, as shown on Holdings’ or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto), of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in contractual right of payment to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary shall have been validly released, or are otherwise discharged or retired in connection with such Asset Sale; (b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by Holdings or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion; (c) any Equity Interests or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (3) or (5) of the next paragraph of this covenant; (d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that Holdings or any other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with the Asset Sale; and (e) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale; _provided that at the time of receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all Designated Non-cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value), _less the amount of Net Proceeds previously realized in cash or Cash Equivalents from the sale of_ previously received Designated Non-cash Consideration is less than the greater of (x) $100.0 million and (y) 10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); 58 ----- _provided that with respect to any Asset Sale, the determination of compliance with clauses (1) and (2) above may be_ made, at the Issuer’s option, on either (x) the date on which such Asset Sale is completed or (y) the date on which a definitive agreement for such Asset Sale is entered into; provided, further, in the case of subclause (y), the definitive agreement shall not be subsequently amended by Holdings or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary in a manner that could cause the Asset Sale to not be in compliance with clauses (1) and (2) as of the date of such amendment. Within eighteen (18) months after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Holdings (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds: (1) (a) to repay Indebtedness and other Obligations of the Issuers or any Guarantor under any Senior Credit Facility and to correspondingly reduce commitments (if any) with respect thereto, (b) to repay Obligations under the Notes or (c) to redeem or repurchase First Lien Obligations (other than the Senior Credit Facility or the Notes) permitted to be incurred by the Issuers or any Guarantor under the terms of the indenture and to correspondingly reduce commitments (if any) with respect thereto; provided that if the Issuers or any Guarantor shall so repay other First Lien Obligations pursuant to clause (c), the Issuers shall have also used (or made an offer, in the case of clause (iii) below, with) a portion of such Net Proceeds pro rata in proportion to the amount thereof used to so repay other First Lien Obligations (based on the respective principal amounts of the Notes and such other First Lien Obligations prior to such repayment) (the “Pro Rata Amount”) to (i) redeem the Pro Rata Amount of Notes as provided under “— Optional Redemption,” (ii) purchase the Pro Rata Amount of Notes that may be repurchased through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof) or (iii) make an offer to purchase the Pro Rata Amount of Notes pursuant to an offer made to all holders in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; (2) to the extent the Net Proceeds are attributable to an Asset Sale of assets, rights or Equity Interests that do not constitute Collateral, to repay Indebtedness secured by such assets, rights or Equity Interests or to repay any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor and to correspondingly reduce commitments (if any) with respect thereto; (3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Equity Interests of, another Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Equity Interests, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings or to increase the percentage ownership by Holdings (or a Restricted Subsidiary) in a Restricted Subsidiary; (4) to make a capital expenditure or other investment in the business of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries (including in other acquisitions permitted under the indenture and in working capital or trading activities); (5) to use such proceeds to comply with applicable capital requirements or finance the working capital needs of a Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, an operating regulated entity or a licensed mortgage Restricted Subsidiary or an Equivalent Regulated Subsidiary (or to make Permitted Investments or Restricted Investments permitted to be made under the covenant described below under the caption “— Restricted Payments” which will be so used by a Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, an operating regulated entity or a licensed mortgage Restricted Subsidiary or an Equivalent Regulated Subsidiary); (6) to repay Trading Debt and to correspondingly reduce commitments (if any) with respect thereto; or (7) a combination of the foregoing clauses (1) through (6), _provided, however, that, in the case of clauses (3) and (4) above, a commitment to make such acquisition, make a_ capital expenditure or other investment made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement that is executed during such eighteen (18) month period shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds so long as such 59 ----- acquisition or expenditure is consummated within six (6) months of the end of such eighteen (18) month period (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event such Net Proceeds are not so invested by the end of such additional six month period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, Holdings may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales (other than Excluded Net Proceeds) that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” Within fifteen days after the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $100.0 million and (y) 10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period, the Issuers will make an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of Notes and, to the extent the Issuers are required by the terms thereof, all holders of other First Lien Obligations containing provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with proceeds of sales of assets, pro rata in proportion to the respective principal amounts of the Notes and such other First Lien Obligations required to be purchased or redeemed, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and purchase or redeem such other First Lien Obligations that may be purchased or redeemed with the Asset Sale Percentage of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes or such other First Lien Obligations, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), and will be payable in cash. If (x) any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer or (y) the Issuers were not required to make an Asset Sale Offer with any Excess Proceeds as a result of the Asset Sale Percentage being less than 100%, the Issuers may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture (such amounts, “Asset Sale Retained Proceeds”). If the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the trustee or DTC will select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis, and in any event, in accordance with applicable procedures of DTC. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. To the extent that the Issuers have reasonably determined that repatriation of (i) any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary is prohibited, restricted or delayed by applicable local law or (ii) any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Assets Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary could result in a material adverse tax consequence, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not constitute Net Proceeds or be required to be applied in compliance with this provisions under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;” _provided that, in any event, the Issuers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take actions within their_ reasonable control that are reasonably required to eliminate such tax effects. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance. If an Asset Sale Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuers will have available funds sufficient to pay the Asset Sale Offer purchase price for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Asset Sale Offer. It is also possible that the events that constitute an Asset Sale may also be events of default under a Senior Credit Facility. These events may permit the lender(s) under such Senior Credit Facility to accelerate the Indebtedness outstanding thereunder. If the Issuers are required to repurchase the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under a Senior Credit Facility if such Indebtedness is accelerated, the Issuers would probably require third-party financing. The Issuers cannot be sure that they would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Indebtedness under the applicable Senior Credit Facility is not paid, the lender(s) thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness, thereby limiting the Issuers’ ability to raise cash to purchase the Notes, and reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the Notes. 60 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; _provided that the incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt. However, if the Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of the refinancing, the U.S. 71 ----- dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the refinancing. Provisions similar to those in this paragraph shall apply in determining compliance with the covenant set forth under the caption “— Liens.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be: (1) the accreted value of Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount; (2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and (3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of: (a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and (b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to Holdings or an Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. 82 ----- Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder of a Note (it being understood that the trustee has no duty to determine whether any such action is prejudicial to any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes) or that would involve the trustee in personal liability. The trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in the holders’ interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or premium, if any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the trustee to provide a notice of Default or notice of acceleration may not be given by the trustee or holders of the Notes (or any other action taken on the assertion of any Default) with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders of the Notes, more than two years prior to such notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the trustee to provide a notice of default or notice of acceleration (or other action). Subject to the provisions of the indenture relating to the duties of the trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have requested in writing the trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered, and, if requested, provided, the trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have not given the trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium, if any, on, or the principal of, the Notes. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the trustee or the holders of Notes, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose (x) the Indebtedness or Guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (z) if the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such holder delivered to the Issuers and the trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of 83 ----- Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuers may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the trustee or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, the trustee and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall have any liability or responsibility to the Issuers, any holder or any other Person in connection with any Noteholder Direction or to determine whether or not any holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other agreement. The Issuers are required to deliver to the trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the indenture. Within 30 days of becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers are required to deliver to the trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

See “Transfer Restrictions.” The indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act (“TIA”). The indenture will only include terms expressly provided for in the indenture and will not incorporate any additional terms from the TIA.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture and the Collateral Documents. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the indenture and the Collateral Documents because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. For all purposes under the indenture, in connection with any Delaware LLC Division (or any comparable event under any applicable jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.

Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if 131 ----- applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with respect to the notes. Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a noteholder (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Indenture, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Restricted Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Trustee through the DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

Effect of Certain Contingencies",327.1.1,,"In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal on the notes, including as described under “Description of notes—Change of Control.” These potential payments may implicate the provisions of Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” According to the applicable Treasury Regulations, certain contingencies (e.g., contingencies that are in the aggregate, as of the date of issuance, “remote” or “incidental”) will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment debt instrument. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that, as of the date of issuance, the foregoing contingency and any other contingencies to which payments on the notes are subject do not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Our position that the notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a Holder, unless such Holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations (generally, on its U.S. federal income tax return for the year during which the Holder acquires notes). Our position is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, a Holder might be required to accrue interest income on the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and to treat any gain recognized on the taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. The Treasury Regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments have not been the subject of authoritative interpretation, however, and the scope of such Treasury Regulations is not certain. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes.

If the notes are treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in taxable income (as ordinary income) such OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to such OID, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID that a U.S. Holder would be required to include in income for each taxable year (or potion thereof) during which the U.S. Holder is the beneficial owner of a note is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to such note for each day during such taxable year (or portion thereof), as determined pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

Certain countries have entered into, and other countries are expected to enter into, agreements with the United States to facilitate the type of information reporting required under FATCA. Such intergovernmental agreements may provide different rules with respect to foreign financial institutions. In addition, FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on the same types of payments to a non-financial foreign entity (including in the capacity as an intermediary) unless the entity certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners, the entity furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial U.S. owner or an exemption applies. A foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity’s failure to comply with the additional certification, information reporting and other specified requirements imposed under FATCA could result in the 30% withholding tax being imposed on any “withholdable payment.” For this purpose, withholdable payments generally include U.S.-source payments otherwise subject to nonresident withholding tax (e.g., U.S.-source interest (including any OID)) and, subject to the following two sentences, also include the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition (including a settlement or redemption) of any debt instruments of U.S. issuers.

This summary addresses only Holders who acquire the notes pursuant to this offering memorandum for cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and hold their notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to Holders in light of their particular circumstances or to Holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax law, such as banks or other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers or brokers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting, insurance companies, entities treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors therein), tax-exempt entities, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, U.S. expatriates, persons holding notes in a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction or as a position in a constructive sale, straddle or wash sale, or U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is other than the U.S. dollar or persons that are required to report income no later than when such income is reported in an “applicable financial statement.” This summary does not address any U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, U.S. federal tax other than income tax (e.g., estate or gift tax), or state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes. We have not requested, and will not request, a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court considering these issues will agree with any of the conclusions we have reached and describe herein or that a court would not sustain a challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation that is organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more “United States persons” within the meaning of Section 7701 of the Code (“U.S. Persons"") have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. Person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, trust or estate that is not a U.S. Holder. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds notes, the tax treatment of a partner in or other owner of such an entity generally will depend on the status of the partner or other owner and the activities of the entity. Partners (or other owners) in a partnership (or other pass-through entity or arrangement) considering an investment in notes are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to them or the partnership’s (or other pass-through entity’s) purchase, ownership, or disposition of the notes. 135 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that any fiduciary of an ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor or other person who proposes to use assets of any ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor to acquire the notes should consult with its counsel regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code, and any applicable Similar Laws, to such an investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA, the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws.

666,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,,107.2.1,,"The United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the corollary provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, impose certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA and plans, arrangements, and accounts that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, respectively, including entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. The U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated regulations 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, which were effectively modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, describing what constitutes the assets of an ERISA Plan with respect to the ERISA Plan’s investment in an entity for purposes of certain provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, including the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan and applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. The prudence of a particular investment must be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the notes. Similar requirements may apply to investments by plans, arrangements, or accounts, such as governmental plans, certain church plans, and non-U.S. plans, and entities such as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans, arrangements or accounts (collectively, “Other Plan Investors”), that are subject to laws, regulations or policies that are similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”). Each ERISA Plan and Other Plan Investor should consider the fact that none of the Issuers, the initial purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor with respect to the decision to acquire notes and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons”) having certain relationships to such ERISA Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan who engaged in such non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise if the notes are acquired with the assets of an ERISA Plan with respect to which an Issuer, the initial purchasers, the trustee, the lenders under the Existing Credit Facilities, or any of their respective affiliates is a party in interest or a disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of ERISA Plan fiduciary making the decision to acquire a note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. However, there can be no assurance that any administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the notes. Other Plan Investors, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans should consult with their counsel before acquiring the notes. 140 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,161

In the purchase agreement, we have agreed that: - for a period of 45 days after the date of this offering memorandum, we will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuers, VFH or any of the other guarantors and having a tenor of more than one year without the prior consent of J.P.

The notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” In the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed that: - the notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements; and - during the initial distribution of the notes, they will offer or sell notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. In addition, with respect to the notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until 40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the notes. In addition, the notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation system. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to 142 ----- make a market in the notes, but are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue any market making in the notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the notes, that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may .have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, it may discontinue them at any time. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment and commercial banking services for us and our affiliates, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates act as lenders and/or agents under the Existing Credit Facilities, and such initial purchasers or their respective affiliates may therefore receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering in connection with the refinancing of the Existing Term Loan Facility as part of the Refinancing Transactions. See “Use of proceeds.” In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates will be lenders, agents and/or arrangers under the Amended Credit Facilities and will receive customary compensation in connection therewith. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is a lender under the Committed Facility. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers. The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. 143 ----- We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the        business day following the date of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery should consult their own advisors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,161
