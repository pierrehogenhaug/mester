**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM                                            CONFIDENTIAL**

### VFH Parent LLC and Valor Co-Issuer, Inc.


and guaranteed by


### Virtu Financial LLC

**$500,000,000     % Senior First Lien Notes due 2031**


**Issue Price:     % plus accrued interest, if any, from         , 2024.**

VFH Parent LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Issuer”), and Valor Co-Issuer, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Co-Issuer” and, together with
the Issuer, the “Issuers”), are offering $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of     % Senior First Lien Notes due 2031 (the “notes”). The Issuers are indirect
subsidiaries of Virtu Financial, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Virtu”).

The notes will mature on        , 2031. The Issuers will pay interest on the notes semi-annually in arrears on        and        of each year,
beginning on         , 2024. The notes will be redeemable on or after       , 2027 at redemption prices that will decrease over time as set forth in this
offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. Prior to       , 2027, the Issuers may, at their
option, redeem some or all of the notes at the price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus an applicable “make whole” premium, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. In addition, prior to       , 2027, the Issuers may, at their option, redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of redemption with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. Prior to        , 2027, the Issuers may also redeem during each
successive twelve-month period following the closing of the offering to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a price equal to 103% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption. See “Description of notes—Optional redemption.” Upon the
occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuers may be required to make an offer to purchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase. See “Description of notes—Repurchase at the option
of holders—Change of control.”

The Issuers’ obligations under the notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured first-lien basis by Virtu Financial LLC (“Virtu Financial”) (the direct parent
of the Issuer) and all of Virtu Financial’s existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) that guarantee or are borrowers under our
Credit Facilities (as defined herein).

The notes and the guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in, subject to permitted liens and certain exceptions described in this offering
memorandum, substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and the guarantors (the “collateral”), which assets also secure the Credit Facilities on a
first-priority basis. See “Description of notes—Security.” The notes and the guarantees will (i) rank equal in right of payment with all of the existing and future
senior indebtedness of the Issuers and guarantors, including indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and the SBI Bonds (as defined herein), before giving effect to
collateral arrangements, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to all of the existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the Issuers and guarantors, (iii) be
effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuers and guarantors that is secured by liens on assets that do not constitute collateral, to
the extent of the value of such assets, (iv) be effectively senior to all of the existing and future indebtedness of the Issuers and guarantors that is unsecured or
secured by the collateral on a junior-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the notes, (v) rank equal with all of the existing and future
indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a first-lien basis, including the Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such
indebtedness, and (v) be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of each subsidiary of the Issuers and guarantors that is
not a guarantor of the notes, including indebtedness under the Committed Facility, the Uncommitted Facility, the Overdraft Facility and the Short Term Facilities
(each as defined herein). See “Description of notes—Brief description of the notes and the note guarantees.”


**Investing in the notes involves significant risks. See “Risk factors” beginning on page 18.**

The offer and sale of the notes and the guarantees thereof have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be
“qualified institutional buyers” as defined in and in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”) and to certain non-U.S. persons outside the
United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Prospective purchasers that are qualified institutional buyers are hereby
notified that the sellers of the notes may be relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A. For further
details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see “Transfer restrictions” and “Plan of distribution.” The Issuers do not intend to apply for listing of the notes
on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes in any automated quotation system. The Issuers are not obligated under any registration rights agreement or
other obligation to register the notes for resale or register the exchange of the notes under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of $2,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof and made to investors in book-entry form through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) for the accounts of its participants, including
Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System, and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme, on or about         , 2024.

**This offering memorandum is highly confidential. You should carefully read the information**
**contained in, and incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum. We and the initial purchasers**
**have not authorized anyone to provide you with different information or to make any representations other**
**than those contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum. We take no**
**responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may**
**give you. This offering memorandum may only be used where the offer and sale of the notes is permitted. You**
**should not assume that the information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this offering**
**memorandum is accurate as of any date other than the date on the front cover of this offering memorandum.**
**Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows may have changed since**
**that date. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum nor any sale made hereunder shall under any**
**circumstances imply that the information herein is correct as of any date subsequent to the date on the cover**
**of this offering memorandum.**

The offering is being made in reliance upon an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for
offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering.

This offering memorandum has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with the proposed offering
of the notes described in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is personal to each offeree and
does not constitute an offer to any other person or to the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire
securities. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the prospective investor and any
person retained to advise such prospective investor with respect to its purchase is unauthorized, and any disclosure
of any of its contents without our prior written consent is prohibited. Each prospective investor, by accepting
delivery of this offering memorandum, agrees to the foregoing and to make no photocopies of this offering
memorandum or any documents referred to herein.

The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum. Nothing
contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum is, or should be relied upon as, a promise
or representation by the initial purchasers as to the past or future.

**None of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state or other federal securities**
**commission, nor any other regulatory authority has approved or disapproved the securities offered hereby,**
**nor have any of the foregoing authorities passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering or the accuracy**
**or adequacy of this offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.**

The notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except
as permitted under the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction pursuant to
registration or exemption from registration. As a prospective purchaser, you should be aware that you may be
required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. Neither we nor the initial
purchasers are making an effort to sell the notes in any jurisdiction where the offer and sale of the notes is
prohibited. We do not make any representation to you that the notes are a legal investment for you. For additional
information, see “Plan of distribution” and “Transfer restrictions.”

In making any investment decision, prospective investors must rely on their own examination of us and the
terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. Prospective investors should not construe anything in,
or incorporated by reference into, this offering memorandum as legal, business or tax advice. Each prospective
investor should consult its own advisors as needed to make its investment decision and to determine whether it is
legally permitted to purchase the notes under applicable legal investment or similar laws or regulations.

Each prospective investor must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction
in which it purchases, offers or sells notes or possesses or distributes this offering memorandum and must obtain any
consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer or sale by it of notes under the laws and
regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which it is subject or in which it makes such purchases, offers or sales, and
neither we nor the initial purchasers, nor any of our or their respective representatives, shall have any responsibility
therefor.

-----

Some of the initial purchasers participating in the offering may engage in transactions that stabilize,
maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes, including over-allotment, stabilizing and short-covering
transactions in the notes, and the imposition of a penalty bid during and after the offering of the notes. Such
stabilization, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a description of these activities, see “Plan of
distribution.”

This offering memorandum contains summaries believed to be accurate with respect to certain documents,
but reference shall be made to the actual documents for complete information. All such summaries are qualified in
their entirety by such reference. Copies of documents referred to herein will be made available to prospective
investors upon request to us or the initial purchasers.

We reserve the right to withdraw the offering of the notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also
reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the notes in whole or in part for any reason and to allot to any
prospective investor less than the full amount of notes sought by such investor.

Each person receiving this offering memorandum acknowledges that (1) it has been afforded an
opportunity to request and to review, and it has received, all additional information considered by it to be necessary
to verify the accuracy of or to supplement the information contained in this offering memorandum, (2) it has not
relied upon the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with its
investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision, (3) this offering memorandum relates to
an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act and may not comply in important respects with
rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC that would apply to an offering document relating to a public offering
of securities and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to make any representation concerning us,
the offering or the notes, other than as contained in this offering memorandum, in connection with an investor’s
examination of the Company and the terms of the offering.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the        business day following the date
of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers
who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact
that the notes initially will settle T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one business day before
delivery should consult their own advisors.

In this offering memorandum, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, the
“Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” (and words of similar import) refer to Virtu Financial and its consolidated
subsidiaries.

The historical financial information presented herein is the historical consolidated financial information of
Virtu, our indirect parent company, and its consolidated subsidiaries. Because all of Virtu’s operations are
conducted through Virtu Financial and the Issuers, the financial condition and results of operations of Virtu are
substantially the same as those of Virtu Financial and the Issuers except as noted in “Summary—Financial
information of Virtu Financial.”

**NO REVIEW BY THE SEC; NO REGISTRATION**

The information included in this offering memorandum does not conform to information that would be
required if the offering was made pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC. This offering
memorandum, as well as any other documents in connection with the offering, will not be reviewed by the SEC.
There are no registration rights associated with the notes, and we have no intention to offer notes registered under
the Securities Act in exchange for the notes offered in the offering or to file a registration statement with respect to
the notes. The indenture governing the notes (the “Indenture”) will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”).

**INDUSTRY AND OTHER STATISTICAL DATA**

Industry and market data contained in or incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum were
obtained through company research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties and industry and general
publications. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry data presented in or incorporated
by reference into this offering memorandum, estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change
based on various factors, including those discussed under the heading “Risk factors” or incorporated by reference
into this offering memorandum.

**DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE; WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**

Information has been incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum from documents filed with
the SEC. The information we incorporate by reference is an important part of this offering memorandum, and later
information that Virtu files with the SEC will automatically update and supersede this information. Except where
context otherwise requires, references to this offering memorandum include the documents incorporated by
reference, and any reference to information “contained in” this offering memorandum includes such documents
incorporated by reference. In all cases, you should rely on the later information over different information included
in this offering memorandum.

We have incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum certain information contained in various
public filings of Virtu, our indirect parent company. Virtu Financial is the parent guarantor of the notes and the
direct or indirect parent of the Issuers. Because all of Virtu’s operations are conducted through Virtu Financial and
the Issuers, the business, financial condition and results of operations of Virtu are substantially the same as those of
Virtu Financial and the Issuers except as noted in “Summary—Financial information of Virtu Financial.”

The following documents filed by Virtu with the SEC are incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum (excluding any information furnished under Item 2.02 or Item 7.01 of any Current Report on
Form 8-K):

    - Virtu’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on
February 16, 2024 (the “Annual Report”);

    - the sections of Virtu’s proxy statement on Schedule 14A, dated April 26, 2024 (the “Virtu Proxy”),
under the captions “Compensation Disclosure and Analysis,” “Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial

    - Virtu’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on
April 26, 2024 (the “Quarterly Report”);

    - Virtu’s current report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2024 and June 7, 2024.

All documents and reports that Virtu files with the SEC (other than any portion of such filings that are
furnished under applicable SEC rules rather than filed) pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act after the date of this offering memorandum and before the later of (1) the completion of the offering of the
securities described in this offering memorandum and (2) the termination of the offering of securities pursuant to
this offering memorandum, shall be incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum from the date of filing
of such documents. Virtu’s publicly available filings can be found on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Except as
**described above, no other information is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum (including,**
**without limitation, information on Virtu’s website).**

You should not assume that the information in this offering memorandum or any documents incorporated
by reference is accurate as of any date other than the date of the applicable document. Any statement contained in a
document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum will be deemed to
be modified or superseded for purposes of this offering memorandum to the extent that a statement contained in this
offering memorandum or any subsequently filed document that is deemed to be incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum modifies or supersedes the statement. Any statement so modified or superseded will not be
deemed, except as so modified or superseded, to constitute a part of this offering memorandum.

**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

In this offering memorandum, we present our Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted Net Trading Income
per day, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before
income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes, Normalized Adjusted EPS, Operating Margins and Adjusted
Operating Expenses (each as defined below). These are non-U.S. GAAP (“Non-GAAP”) financial measures of
financial performance that are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measure.

- “Adjusted Net Trading Income” is the amount of revenue we generate from our market-making activities, or
trading income, net, plus commissions, net and technology services, plus interest and dividends income, less
direct costs associated with those revenues, including brokerage, exchange, clearance fees and payments for
order flow, net, and interest and dividends expense. Management believes that this measurement is useful for
comparing general operating performance from period to period. Although we use Adjusted Net Trading
Income as a financial measure to assess the performance of our business, the use of Adjusted Net Trading
Income is limited because it does not include certain material costs that are necessary to operate our business.
Our presentation of Adjusted Net Trading Income should not be construed as an indication that our future
results will be unaffected by revenues or expenses that are not directly associated with our core business
activities. For a reconciliation of Trading income, net to Adjusted Net Trading Income, see footnote 1 under the
caption “Summary—Summary historical consolidated financial and other data.” “Adjusted Net Trading Income
per day” is calculated by dividing Adjusted Net Trading Income by the number of trading days in the respective
period.

- “EBITDA” measures our operating performance by adjusting net income to exclude financing interest expense
on long-term borrowings, debt issue cost related to debt refinancing, prepayment and commitment fees,
depreciation and amortization, amortization of purchased intangibles and acquired capitalized software, and
income tax expense, and “Adjusted EBITDA” measures our operating performance by further adjusting
EBITDA to exclude severance, transaction advisory fees and expenses, termination of office leases, charges
related to share based compensation and other expenses, which includes reserves for legal matters and other,
net, which includes gains and losses from strategic investments, the sales of businesses, and other income. For a
reconciliation of Net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA see footnote 1 under the caption “Summary—
Summary historical consolidated financial and other data.”

- “Normalized Adjusted Net Income,” “Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes” and “Normalized
provision for income taxes” are calculated by adjusting net income to exclude certain items and other non-cash
items, assuming that all vested and unvested Virtu Financial Units have been exchanged for Class A Common
Stock, and applying an effective tax rate, which was approximately 24%. For a reconciliation of Net income to
Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes and Normalized
Adjusted EPS, see footnote 3 under the caption “Summary—Summary historical consolidated financial and
other data.”

- “Operating Margins” are calculated by dividing net income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Adjusted Net
Trading Income.

- “Adjusted Operating Expenses” are calculated by adjusting total operating expenses to exclude severance, share

v


-----

based compensation, reserves for legal matters, termination of office leases, connectivity early termination and
write-down of assets. For a reconciliation of certain operating expenses to Adjusted Cash Compensation,
Adjusted Communication & Data Processing, Adjusted Operations & Administrative, Adjusted Cash Operating
Expenses and Total Adjusted Operating Expenses, see footnote 6 under the caption “Summary—Summary
historical consolidated financial and other data.”

Adjusted Net Trading Income, Adjusted Net Trading Income per day, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for
income taxes, Normalized Adjusted EPS, Operating Margins and Adjusted Operating Expenses (collectively, the
“Company’s Non-GAAP Measures”) are non-GAAP financial measures used by management in evaluating
operating performance and in making strategic decisions. In addition, the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures or
similar Non-GAAP financial measures are used by research analysts, investment bankers and lenders to assess our
operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures
provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and cash flows because they assist both
investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business. The
Company’s Non-GAAP Measures provide indicators of general economic performance that are not affected by
fluctuations in certain costs or other items. Accordingly, management believes that these measurements are useful
for comparing general operating performance from period to period.

Furthermore, the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below) and the Indenture will contain covenants
and other tests based on metrics similar to Adjusted EBITDA. Other companies may define Adjusted Net Trading
Income, Adjusted Net Trading Income per day, Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized Adjusted Net Income, Normalized
Adjusted Net Income before income taxes, Normalized provision for income taxes, Operating Margins and Adjusted
Operating Expenses differently, and as a result the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures may not be directly
comparable to those of other companies. Although we use the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures as financial
measures to assess the performance of our business, such use is limited because they do not include certain material
costs necessary to operate our business.

The Company’s Non-GAAP Measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, Net
Income in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of performance. Our presentation of the Company’s NonGAAP Measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or
nonrecurring items. The Company’s Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not
consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these
limitations are:

- they do not reflect every cash expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

- our EBITDA-based measures do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary
to service interest or principal payment on our debt;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will
often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future, and our EBITDA-based measures do not reflect
any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated statements
of cash flows;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of
our ongoing operations; and

- they do not reflect limitations on our costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us.

Because of these limitations, the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures are not intended as alternatives to Net
income as indicators of our operating performance or our most comparable or U.S. GAAP measurements and should

vi


-----

not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as
measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. We compensate for these limitations by using
the Company’s Non-GAAP Measures along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements,
to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. These U.S. GAAP measurements include operating Net Income,
operating expenses, cash flows from operations and cash flow data.

The calculation of our EBITDA-based measures may also differ from the calculation of “Consolidated
EBITDA” (or similar measures) for purposes of the Indenture, our Credit Facilities (as defined below) or the
agreements governing our other indebtedness. See “Description of notes.”

**SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum, as well as our public documents and statements, contain forward-looking
statements that are subject to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should not place undue
reliance on forward-looking statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our
operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control.
Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations,
including descriptions of our business strategy. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, including the terms “may,” “will,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology
and expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the
industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other
factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. As you read and consider this offering memorandum and
our public documents and statements, you should understand that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
performance or results and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the
development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the
forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum and our public documents and statements. By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those
described under the heading “Risk factors” in this offering memorandum and “Risk Factors” in each of our Annual
Report and Quarterly Report, because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur
in the future. Although we believe that the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum and
our Annual Report and Quarterly Report are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many
factors, including those described under the heading “Risk factors” in this offering memorandum and “Risk Factors”
in each of our Annual Report and Quarterly Report, could affect our actual financial results or results of operations
and cash flows, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements,
including but not limited to:

- volatility in levels of overall trading activity;

- dependence upon trading counterparties, clients and clearing houses performing their obligations to us;

- failures of our customized trading platform;

- risks inherent to the electronic market making business and trading generally;

- recent SEC rule proposals focused on equity markets may, if adopted, materially change U.S. equity market
structure, including by reducing overall trading volumes, reducing off-exchange trading and market-making
opportunities, requiring additional tools, platforms and services to register as an alternative trading system
(“ATS”) or exchange, and generally increasing the implicit and explicit cost as well as the complexity of the
U.S. equities eco-system for all participants, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business;

- additionally, enhanced regulatory, congressional, and media scrutiny, including attention to electronic trading,
wholesale market making and off-exchange trading, payment for order flow, and other market structure topics
may result in additional potential changes in regulation or law which could have an adverse effect on our
business as well as adversely impact the public's perception of us or of companies in our industry;

- increased competition in market-making activities and execution services;

- dependence on continued access to sources of liquidity;

- risks associated with self-clearing and other operational elements of our business, including but not limited to
risks related to funding and liquidity;

- litigation or other legal and regulatory-based liabilities;

- changes in laws, rules or regulations, including proposed legislation that would impose taxes on certain
financial transactions in the European Union, the U.S. (and certain states therein) and other jurisdictions and
other potential changes which could increase our corporate or other tax obligations in one or more jurisdictions;

- obligations to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations in the U.S. and abroad;

- need to maintain and continue developing proprietary technologies;

- capacity constraints, system failures, and delays;

- dependence on third-party infrastructure or systems;

- use of open source software;

- failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology;

- failure to protect confidential and proprietary information;

- failure to protect our systems from internal or external cyber threats that could result in damage to our computer
systems, business interruption, loss of data, monetary payment demands or other consequences;

- risks associated with international operations and expansion, including failed acquisitions or dispositions;

- the effects of and changes in economic conditions (such as volatility in the financial markets, increased
inflation, monetary conditions and foreign currency and continued or exacerbated exchange rate fluctuations,
foreign currency controls and/or government mandated pricing controls, as well as in trade, monetary, fiscal and
tax policies in international markets), political conditions (such as military actions and terrorist activities), and
other global events such as fires, geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics or extreme weather;

- risks associated with potential growth and associated corporate actions;

- risks associated with new and emerging asset classes and eco-systems in which we may participate, including
digital assets, including risks related to volatility in the underlying assets, regulatory uncertainty, evolving
industry practices and standards around custody, clearing and settlement, and other risks inherent in a new and
evolving asset class;

- inability to access, or delay in accessing the capital markets to sell shares or raise additional capital;

- loss of key executives and failure to recruit and retain qualified personnel;

**Overview**

We are a leading financial firm that leverages cutting edge technology to deliver liquidity to the global
markets and innovative, transparent trading solutions to our clients. Leveraging our global market structure
expertise and scaled, multi-asset infrastructure, we provide our clients a robust product suite including offerings in
execution, liquidity sourcing, analytics and broker-neutral, multi-dealer platforms in workflow technology. Our
product offerings allow our clients to trade on hundreds of venues across over 50 countries and in multiple asset
classes, including global equities, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), options, foreign exchange, futures, fixed
income, cryptocurrencies, and myriad other commodities. Our integrated, multi-asset analytics platform provides a
range of pre- and post-trade services, data products and compliance tools that our clients rely upon to invest, trade
and manage risk across global markets. We believe that our broad diversification, in combination with our
proprietary technology platform and low-cost structure, gives us the scale necessary to grow our business around
the globe as we service clients and facilitate risk transfer between global capital markets participants by providing
liquidity, while at the same time earning attractive margins and returns.

Technology and operational efficiency are at the core of our business, and our focus on market making
and order routing technology is a key element of our success. We have developed a proprietary, multi asset, multicurrency technology platform that is highly reliable, scalable and modular, and we integrate directly with
exchanges, liquidity centers, and our clients. Our market data, order routing, transaction processing, risk
management and market surveillance technology modules manage our market making and institutional agency
activities in an efficient manner that enables us to scale our activities globally, across additional securities and other
financial instruments and asset classes, without significant incremental costs or third-party licensing or processing
fees.

We believe that technology-enabled market makers like Virtu serve an important role in maintaining and
improving the overall health and efficiency of the global capital markets by providing market participants with an
efficient means to transfer risk and analyze the quality of execution. We believe that market participants benefit
from the increased liquidity, lower overall trading costs and execution transparency that Virtu provides.

Our execution services and client solutions products are designed to be transparent, because we believe
transparency makes markets more efficient and helps investors make better, more informed decisions. We use the
latest technology to create and deliver liquidity to global markets and innovative trading solutions and analytics
tools to our clients. We interact directly with hundreds of retail brokers, Registered Investment Advisors, private
client networks, sell-side brokers, and buy-side institutions.

We have two operating segments: Market Making and Execution Services, and one non-operating
segment: Corporate. Our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages our business
according to these segments.

We primarily conduct our Americas equities business through our SEC registered broker dealer, Virtu
Americas, LLC (“VAL”). We are registered with the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”) and the Financial Conduct
Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) for our European trading, the Canadian Investment
Regulatory Organization (“CIRO”) and the Ontario Securities Commission for our Canadian trading, and the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”), Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (“SFC”), and
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) for our Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) trading. We are
registered as a market maker or liquidity provider and/or enter into direct obligations to provide liquidity on nearly
every exchange or venue that offers such programs. We engage regularly with regulators around the world on
issues affecting electronic trading and other matters that may affect our business and the operation of the financial

1


-----

markets and advocate for increased transparency. In the U.S., we conduct our business from our headquarters in
New York City and our offices in Boston, Austin, Texas, Chicago, Short Hills, New Jersey, and Palm Beach
Gardens, Florida. Abroad, we conduct our business through trading centers located in London, Dublin, Paris,
Singapore, Hong Kong, Toronto, and Sydney.

**_Market Making_**

Our Market Making segment principally consists of market making in the cash, futures, and options
markets across global equities, fixed income, currencies, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. As a leading, low cost
market maker dedicated to improving efficiency and providing liquidity across multiple asset classes and
geographies, we aim to provide critical market functionality and robust price competition in the securities and other
financial instruments in which we provide liquidity. The scale and diversity of our market-making activities
provide added liquidity and transparency to the financial markets, which we believe are necessary and valuable
components to the efficient functioning of markets and benefit all market participants. We support transparent and
efficient, technologically advanced marketplaces, and advocate for legislation and regulation that promotes fair and
transparent access to the financial markets.

As a market maker, we commit capital on a principal basis by offering to buy securities from, or sell
securities to, broker dealers, banks and institutions. We engage in principal trading in the Market Making segment
direct to clients as well as in a supplemental capacity on exchanges, ATSs and other market centers. As a
complement to electronic market making, our cash trading business handles specialized orders and transacts on the
OTC Link ATS operated by OTC Markets Group Inc.

We make markets in a number of different asset classes. We register as market makers and liquidity
providers where available and support affirmative market-making obligations.

We provide competitive and deep liquidity that helps to create more efficient markets around the world.
We stand ready, at any time, to buy or sell a broad range of securities and other financial instruments, and we
generate revenue by buying and selling large volumes of securities and other financial instruments while earning
small bid/ask spreads.

We believe the overall level of volumes and realized volatility as well as the attractiveness of the order
flow we interact with and the level of retail participation in the various markets we serve have the greatest impact
on our businesses. Increases in market volatility can cause bid/ask spreads to temporarily widen as market
participants are more willing to transact immediately and as a result market makers’ capture rate per notional
amount transacted increases.

Technology is at the core of our business. Our team of in-house software engineers develops our software
and applications, and we utilize optimized infrastructure to integrate directly with the exchanges and other trading
venues on which we provide liquidity. Our focus on technology and our ability to leverage our technology enables
us to be one of the lowest cost providers of liquidity to the global electronic trading marketplace.

Leveraging the scalability and low costs of our platform, we are able to test and rapidly deploy new
liquidity provisioning strategies, expand to new securities, asset classes and geographies and increase transaction
volumes at little incremental cost. These efficiencies are central to our ability to deliver consistently positive
Adjusted Net Trading Income as our profitability per trade and per instrument is not significant, particularly in U.S.
equities.

Our transaction processing is automated over the full life cycle of a trade. Our market-making platform
generates and disseminates continuous bid and offer quotes. At the moment when a trade is executed, our systems
capture and deliver this information back to the source, in most cases within a fraction of a second, and the trade
record is written into our clearing system, where it flows through a chain of control accounts that allow us to
automatically and efficiently reconcile trades, positions and payments until the final settlement occurs.

2


-----

We have built and continuously refine our automated and integrated, real time systems for global trading,
risk management, clearing and cash management, among other purposes. We have also assembled a proprietary
connectivity network between us and exchanges around the world. Efficiency and speed in performing prescribed
functions are always crucial requirements for our systems, and generally we focus on opportunities in markets that
are sufficiently advanced to allow the seamless deployment of our automated strategies, risk management system
and core technology.

Our core operations team across our offices in North America, APAC and Europe monitors our systems
24 hours a day, five days a week. This function provides coverage for our full technology platform, including our
market data, order routing, transaction processing, and risk management technology modules.

**_Execution Services_**

We offer agency execution services and trading venues that provide transparent trading in global equities,
ETFs, fixed income, currencies, and commodities to institutions, banks and broker dealers. We generally earn
commissions when transacting as an agent for our clients. Within the Execution Services segment, we offer the
following categories of products and services:

    - Agency-based, execution-only trading, done through a variety of access points including:

`o` algorithmic trading and order routing;

`o` institutional sales traders who offer portfolio trading and single stock sales trading providing
execution expertise for program, block and riskless principal trades in global equities and
ETFs; and

`o` matching of client conditional orders via POSIT Alert and in our ATSs, including Virtu
MatchIt and POSIT.

    - Workflow Technology, and our integrated, broker-neutral trading tools delivered across the globe
including order and execution management systems and order management software applications and
network connectivity; and

    - Trading Analytics, including

`o` tools enabling portfolio managers and traders to improve pre-trade and real-time execution
performance and post-trade analysis;

`o` portfolio construction and optimization decisions; and

`o` securities valuation.

**_Corporate_**

Our Corporate segment contains investments principally in strategic financial services-oriented
opportunities and maintains corporate overhead expenses and all other income and expenses that are not
attributable to our operating segments.

**Refinancing Transactions**

**_Entry into Amended Credit Facilities_**

Concurrently with the closing of this offering, we expect to amend our existing credit agreement (the
“Existing Credit Agreement”), with the lenders party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative
agent. The Amended Credit Agreement will (i) provide for a seven year senior secured first lien refinancing term

3

loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,245 million (the “New Term Loan Facility”), (ii) to increase
the commitments under our existing senior secured first lien revolving credit facility to $300 million and extend the
maturity thereof (the “Extended Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the New Term Loan Facility, the
“Amended Credit Facilities”) and (iii) amend certain other provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement. The
closing of the Amended Credit Facilities remains subject to market and other customary conditions. The
consummation of this offering is not contingent upon the closing of the Amended Credit Facilities. The closing of
the Amended Credit Facilities is not contingent upon the consummation of this offering.

See “Description of other indebtedness—Long-term borrowings—Amended Credit Facilities” for a
description of our New Term Loan Facility and Extended Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Refinancing of Existing Term Loan Facility_**

The Existing Credit Agreement provides for (i) a senior secured first lien term loan facility in an aggregate
principal amount of $1,800.0 million (the “Existing Term Loan Facility”) and (ii) a $250.0 million senior secured
first lien revolving credit facility available to the Issuer, with a $20.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a
$20.0 million swingline sub-facility (the “Existing Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the Existing Term
Loan Facility, the “Existing Credit Facilities”). As of March 31, 2024, $1,727 million was outstanding under the
Existing Term Loan Facility and no amounts were outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

We intend to use the proceeds from this offering of the notes to repay $500 million aggregate principal
amount outstanding under the Existing Term Loan Facility. If the closing of the Amended Credit Facilities is
successfully consummated, we intend to use the proceeds from the New Term Loan Facility to repay all remaining
amounts outstanding under the Existing Term Loan Facility. We intend to use cash on hand to pay discounts, fees,
commissions and expenses of the offering of the notes and the other Refinancing Transactions (as defined below),
as applicable. If the offering of the notes and the closing of the Amended Credit Facilities are both successfully
consummated, the Issuers expect to repay all outstanding amounts under, and refinance, the Existing Term Loan
Facility. The closing of the Amended Credit Facilities remains subject to market and other customary conditions.
The consummation of this offering is not contingent upon the closing of the Amended Credit Facilities. The closing
of the Amended Credit Facilities is not contingent upon the consummation of this offering. See “—Sources and
uses” and “Use of proceeds.”

In this offering memorandum, the defined term “Credit Facilities” refers to the Existing Credit Facilities
or, if the closing of the Amended Credit Facilities is successfully consummated and the Existing Term Loan
Facility is refinanced in full, the Amended Credit Facilities.

In this offering memorandum, we refer to the offering of the notes contemplated hereby, the closing of the
Amended Credit Agreement, the refinancing of the Existing Term Loan Facility, the payment of discounts, fees
(including break fees), commissions and expenses related to the foregoing, collectively, as the “Refinancing
Transactions.”

The diagram below sets forth a simplified version of our organizational structure and our principal
indebtedness after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes
only and does not represent all legal entities affiliated with, or all obligations of, the Issuers or their subsidiaries.

(1) As our sole managing member, Virtu manages and operates our business and controls our strategic decisions and

day-to-day operations. Virtu does not guarantee the Existing Credit Facilities and will not guarantee the notes.

(2) Virtu Financial will guarantee the notes and the Credit Facilities on a senior secured first-lien basis.

existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) that also guarantee the Credit Facilities.
The notes and the guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in, subject to permitted liens and certain
exceptions described in this offering memorandum, substantially all of the existing and future assets of the Issuers and the
guarantors, which assets will also secure the Credit Facilities on a first-priority basis.

(5) Immaterial subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries and certain other subsidiaries will not guarantee the

Credit Facilities or the notes. See “Description of notes—Certain covenants—Additional note guarantees.” On an
unaudited basis, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, our non-guarantor subsidiaries, in the aggregate,
excluding intercompany liabilities, would have accounted for: (i) approximately 85.0% of our consolidated assets and
approximately 82.1% of our liabilities, as of March 31, 2024; and (ii) approximately 95.6%, of our consolidated total
revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

necessarily indicative of future results, and Virtu’s interim results are not necessarily indicative of results to be
expected for a full fiscal year period.

Because all of Virtu’s operations are conducted through Virtu Financial and the Issuers, the financial
condition and results of operations of Virtu are substantially the same as those of Virtu Financial and the Issuers
except as noted in “—Financial information of Virtu Financial.”

statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows data for the three months ended March 31, 2024
and 2023 and Virtu’s historical consolidated statements of financial condition data as of March 31, 2024 have been
derived from Virtu’s unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference in this
offering memorandum.

The summary unaudited statement of operations data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 have
been derived from the arithmetic combination of (x) the relevant line items presented in Virtu’s historical
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, plus (y) the relevant line items
presented in Virtu’s historical consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024,
minus (z) the relevant line items presented in Virtu’s historical consolidated statement of operations for the three
months ended March 31, 2023. Virtu’s historical consolidated statements of comprehensive income and statements
of cash flows data for the three months ended December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023 have been
derived from Virtu’s unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are not included in or incorporated by
reference in this offering memorandum.

The historical financial and other data should be read in conjunction with: Virtu’s consolidated financial
statements and the related notes to those financial statements, which are incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum, and the information included under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum from each of Virtu’s

**Financial Information of Virtu Financial**

We have incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum various financial information of Virtu,
our indirect parent company. Virtu’s operations are conducted through Virtu Financial and the Issuers. As a result,
there are no material differences between our financial statements and Virtu’s consolidated financial statements for
the periods presented except as follows:

(i) Virtu’s cash and cash equivalents are lesser in the amount of $792.5 million, $975.3 million,
$942.2 and million and $393.9 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and March 31,
2024, respectively;

(ii) Virtu’s deferred tax assets are lesser in the amount of $3.4 million, $7.7 million, $8.8 million and
$3.0 million as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and March 31, 2024, respectively;

(iii) Virtu’s provision for income taxes is lesser in the amount of $30.5 million, $35.8 million, $38.8
million and $9.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, and for the three
months ended March 31, 2024, respectively; and

(iv) Virtu’s financial statements include a portion of our members’ equity in Virtu Financial that is
represented as noncontrolling interest.

This section should be read in conjunction with Virtu’s consolidated financial statements and the related
notes to those financial statements, which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, and the
information included under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum from each of Virtu’s Annual
Report and Quarterly Report, as well as the information under the captions “Use of proceeds” and
“Capitalization” in this offering memorandum.

**RISK FACTORS**

_You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and the risk factors contained in our Annual_
_Report and our Quarterly Report, which are incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum, as well as the_
_other information and documents incorporated by reference or contained in this offering memorandum, before_
_purchasing any notes. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of_
_operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. In addition, these risks are not the only risks that we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those that we currently view to be immaterial could_
_also materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash_
_flows. In any such case, you may lose all or a part of your investment in the notes._

**Risks related to our indebtedness and the notes**

**_We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could negatively impact our business and financial_**
**_condition, and our debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business._**

We are a highly leveraged company. As of March 31, 2024, on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to
the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had an aggregate of $1,745 million outstanding indebtedness under
our long-term borrowings. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may
need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we
will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all.

Additionally, we are party to (i) the $400.0 million Uncommitted Facility under which we had $80.0
million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2024, (ii) the $650.0 million Committed Facility under which we
had $50.0 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and (ii) the $10.0 million Overdraft Facility
under which we had $10.0 million of borrowings outstanding as of March 31, 2024. Additionally, we had no
borrowings outstanding under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2024, and expect to have no
borrowings outstanding under our Extended Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date. Also, certain of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries are party to various short-term credit facilities with various prime brokers and other
financial institutions in an aggregate amount of approximately $598.2 million under which we had approximately
$170.7 million in borrowings outstanding at March 31, 2024.

The credit agreement governing the Credit Facilities (the “Credit Agreement”) and the Indenture will
contain and any other existing or future indebtedness of ours may contain, a number of covenants that impose
significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’
ability to, among other things:

- incur additional debt, guarantee indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity interests;

- pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, our equity interests or make other
restricted payments;

- prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

- make loans or certain investments;

- sell certain assets;

- consolidate, merge or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

- create liens on certain assets;

- enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and

- designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.

18


-----

As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may
be unable to successfully execute our strategy, engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or
capital needs. In addition, if the usage under our Extended Revolving Credit Facility exceeds a specified level, the
Extended Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a specified net first lien leverage ratio, which may
require us to take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives.

We may be unable to remain in compliance with the financial maintenance and other covenants contained
in the Credit Agreement, and our obligation to comply with these covenants may adversely affect our ability to
operate our business. A failure to comply with the covenants under the Credit Agreement, the notes or any of our
other future indebtedness could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If any such event of default
has occurred and is continuing, the lenders under our Credit Agreement, among other things:

- will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;

- could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be
immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or

- could effectively prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes,

any of which could result in an event of default under the notes or cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness.
If we default on our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operation could suffer a material
adverse effect.

We will pledge substantially all of our and our guarantor subsidiaries’ assets as collateral under the Credit
Agreement and the notes. If we were unable to repay such indebtedness, the lenders under the Credit Agreement
and, subject to certain intercreditor arrangements, the holders of the notes, could proceed to exercise remedies
against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If any of our outstanding indebtedness under the
Credit Agreement, the notes or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our
assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. We do not have sufficient working capital to satisfy our
debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a significant part of our outstanding indebtedness.

**_Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured_**
**_debt, which could intensify the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness._**

We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of
the Indenture and the Credit Agreement will contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the
indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition to the notes and our
borrowings under the Credit Facilities, the covenants under any other existing or future debt instruments could allow
us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness and, subject to certain limitations, such additional
indebtedness could be secured on a pari passu basis with the notes. Additionally, our governing documents do not
contain any limitations on the amount of debt we may incur, and we do not have a formal policy limiting the amount
of debt we may incur in the future. The more leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn our security holders,
will be exposed to certain risks described above under “—We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which
could negatively impact our business and financial condition, and our debt agreements contain restrictions that will
limit our flexibility in operating our business.”

**_We will have the capacity to make certain payments, including dividends, under the Indenture and the Credit_**
**_Agreement._**

The Indenture and the Credit Agreement will limit our ability to make certain payments, including
dividends or distributions in respect of shares of our capital stock, the purchase, redemption, or retirement of any
equity interests or subordinated debt, and restricted investments. However, these limitations are subject to a number

19


-----

of exceptions, including certain exceptions based on a calculation of our net income, equity issuances, receipt of
capital contributions and return on certain investments subsequent to the date of the offering, as well as exceptions
to accommodate our structure as an “Up-C,” including exceptions for certain tax distributions to Virtu. Accordingly,
we will have the capacity to make certain restricted payments under the Credit Agreement (in addition to certain
permitted investments). See “Description of notes—Certain covenants—Restricted payments.”

**_To service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. If we fail to generate sufficient cash_**
**_flow from future operations, we may have to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or seek to obtain_**
**_additional financing._**

We expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and the amounts due under the notes and our other
indebtedness primarily from operations. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these payments thus depends on
our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative, regulatory
and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from
operations in the future, which could result in our being unable to pay amounts due under our outstanding
indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, such as future capital expenditures. If we do
not have sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then-existing
indebtedness (including the notes), sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures or seek to raise additional capital,
any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our
indebtedness, including the notes, will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at
such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more
onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future
debt agreements, including the Indenture, may restrict us from adopting any of these activities. Any failure to make
scheduled payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our
credit rating, which could negatively impact our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable
terms, or at all. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to achieve any of these alternatives could materially
adversely affect the value of the notes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and
our ability to pay the amounts due under the notes and our other indebtedness.

In addition, if we are unable to meet our obligations under the notes, the holders of the notes would have
the right to cause the entire principal amount of the notes to become immediately due and payable. If the amounts
outstanding under our debt instruments are accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets will be sufficient to
repay in full the money owed to holders of our indebtedness, including holders of the notes.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the Credit Facilities, the Uncommitted Facility, the Committed Facility and the
Overdraft Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates continue to
increase, our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the
amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.

Assuming an aggregate principal balance of $1,745 million is outstanding under our Amended Credit
Facilities at March 31, 2024 on an as-adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, a 1%
increase in the interest rate we are charged on the Amended Credit Facilities would have increased our annual
interest expense by $1.7 million.

We have entered into, and in the future may continue to enter into interest rate swaps that involve the
exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not
maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may
not fully mitigate our interest rate risk, may prove disadvantageous or may create additional risks.

20


-----

**_An increase in market interest rates would increase our interest costs on existing and future debt._**

If interest rates continue to increase, so could our interest costs for any new debt and our variable rate debt
obligations. This increased cost could make future financing by us more costly, as well as lower our current period
earnings. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or cause us to
pay higher interest rates upon refinancing.

**_Our credit ratings may not reflect the risks of investing in the notes._**

Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when they become
due and include many subjective factors. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will
generally affect the value of the notes. Also, these credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating
to the structure or marketing of the notes. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security
and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated
independently of any other agency’s rating. Our credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time,
and such ratings may be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency, if, in that rating agency’s
judgment, circumstances so warrant. On May 2, 2024, the Issuer’s ratings, including its corporate family rating,
issuer rating and backed senior secured bank credit facility rating, were placed on review for downgrade by
Moody’s. On June 4, 2024, Moody’s downgraded all such ratings. Our credit ratings may not reflect all of the
factors that would be important to holders of the notes. Actual or anticipated changes or further downgrades in our
credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect
the value of the notes, may increase our borrowing costs and may negatively impact our ability to incur additional
debt.

**_Adverse changes in our credit rating would negatively impact the market price or liquidity of the notes._**

Our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions
but also by the debt ratings assigned to the Company by the major credit rating agencies. Credit rating agencies
continually revise their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit rating agencies also evaluate
our industry as a whole and may change their credit ratings for us based on their overall view of our industry. We
cannot be sure that credit rating agencies will maintain their ratings on the notes. A negative change in our ratings
would have a negative impact on the trading prices of the notes, liquidity in trading of the notes and on our ability to
secure future debt financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Credit ratings are not recommendations to
purchase, hold or sell the notes. Noteholders will have no recourse against us or any other party in the event of a
change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings.

**_Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions that could limit their ability to make dividends,_**
**_distributions or other payments, which in turn could affect our ability to meet our obligations, including with_**
**_respect to the notes._**

As certain of our subsidiaries are members of FINRA and other SROs, we are subject to certain regulations
regarding changes in ownership or control and material changes in operations. For example, FINRA’s NASD
Rule 1017 generally provides that FINRA approval must be obtained in connection with certain change of
ownership or control transactions, such as a transaction that results in a single entity or person owning 25% or more
our equity. Similarly, Virtu Financial Ireland Limited, one of our Irish subsidiaries, is subject to change in control
regulations promulgated by the Central Bank of Ireland, and other registered or regulated foreign subsidiaries may
be subject to similar regulations in applicable jurisdictions. As a result of these regulations, our future efforts to sell
shares of our common stock or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited. We may be subject to similar
restrictions in other jurisdictions in which we operate.

A substantial percentage of our consolidated assets and revenues are held and generated by regulated
subsidiaries.

**_Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes and similar laws may permit courts, under specific_**
**_circumstances, to avoid the notes and the guarantees related to the notes (and the related security interests), to_**

21


-----

**_require noteholders to return payments received from us or the guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental_**
**_to the noteholders._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes, the
delivery of any guarantees of the notes, including guarantees (if any) that may be entered into thereafter under the
terms of the Indenture, and the related security interests. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions
of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the issuance of the notes and the
delivery of guarantees related to the notes and the related security interests could be avoided as fraudulent transfers
or conveyances if a court determined that the Issuer or the Co-Issuer, at the time it issued the notes, or any of the
guarantors, at the time it delivered the applicable guarantee (or, in some jurisdictions, at the time payment became
due under the notes or a guarantee thereof),

- issued the notes or provided the applicable guarantee, as the case may be, with the intent of hindering, delaying
or defrauding any present or future creditor; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the notes or providing such
guarantee, as the case may be, and

- it was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance or provision, or

- it was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small
capital, or

- it intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature.

In addition, any payment by the debtors or guarantors under the notes or guarantee of the notes could be
voided and required to be returned to the debtors or such guarantors, as the case may be, or deposited in a fund for
the benefit of the creditors of the debtor or guarantors. Among other things, a payment could potentially be voided if
such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any
outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such party would have received
in a distribution under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”) in a
hypothetical Chapter 7 case.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that we or a
guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or its guarantee or the
related security interest if we or a guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of
the notes and/or such guarantee. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to
the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuers’ benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the
guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law
applied in any proceeding to determine whether any fraudulent transfer has occurred, such that we cannot be certain
as to the standards a court would use to determine whether the Issuers or the guarantors was solvent at the relevant
time which, if applicable in a particular jurisdiction, may be when payment became due under the notes or a
guarantee. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that it would not determine
that we or a guarantor were indeed solvent on that date, or that any payments to the holders of the notes (including
under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances; or that the issuance of the
notes and the guarantees would not be avoided or subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally,
however, a debtor or a guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

- the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets,

- the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable

22


-----

liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature, or

- it could not pay its debts as they become due.

To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds unenforceable for any other reason the notes or a
guarantee (or the related security interest), your claims against the Issuers or the relevant guarantor would be
eliminated or limited and you would lose the right to enforce or otherwise benefit from the applicable security
interest. To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds the notes or the guarantees unenforceable for any other
reason, your claims under the notes and related guarantees could be effectively subordinated to our other secured
debt. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts already received from the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or
such guarantor. Further, the avoidance of the notes and/or a related guarantee could result in an event of default with
respect to our other debt that, in turn, could result in acceleration of such debt.

In certain circumstances, a court may subordinate claims in respect of the notes and/or a guarantee to all
other debts of the Issuers or the guarantors, or take other actions detrimental to the noteholders, based on equitable
or other grounds. We cannot be certain as to the standards that a court might apply and whether it might find such
subordination or other actions appropriate.

Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that
it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This
provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent
transfer laws or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the
guarantee worthless. Even if the guarantees of the notes remain in force, the remaining amount due and collectible
under the guarantee may not be sufficient to pay the notes in full when due.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero, avoided or released under certain_**
**_circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

Holders of the notes will have the benefit of the guarantees of all of our wholly owned domestic
subsidiaries that are borrowers under or guarantee our Credit Facilities (except the Issuers). The guarantees,
however, are limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law. In
addition, guarantees provided after the issue date of the notes may be especially subject to challenge as an avoidable
preference under certain circumstances. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be reduced to
zero, depending on (among other things) the amount of other obligations of such guarantor. Furthermore, under the
circumstances discussed above, a court under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes could void the
obligations under a guarantee or further subordinate it to all other obligations of the guarantors.

As a result, a guarantor’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending
upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee
issued by a company that is not in such company’s corporate interests, the burden of which exceeds the benefit to
the company or which is entered into within a certain period prior to insolvency or bankruptcy, may not be valid and
enforceable. It is possible that a guarantor, a creditor of a guarantor or the insolvency administrator in the case of an
insolvency of a guarantor may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that the applicable court
may determine the guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event that any guarantees are deemed invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the
notes could be structurally subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable guarantor or you would no longer have any
claim against the applicable guarantor. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources,
including the remaining obligors, if any.

**_The notes will be structurally subordinated to the obligations of Virtu Financial’s non-guarantor subsidiaries._**
**_Your right to receive payment on the notes could be adversely affected if any of our non-guarantor subsidiaries_**
**_declares bankruptcy, liquidates or reorganizes._**

Some but not all of Virtu Financial’s subsidiaries will guarantee the notes. Virtu Financial’s foreign
subsidiaries and non-wholly owned subsidiaries will not be guarantors of the notes. Additionally, regulated

23


-----

subsidiaries, which include all of our subsidiaries registered as broker-dealers and other regulated entities, and their
subsidiaries, will not be guarantors of the notes. Furthermore, a subsidiary guarantee of the notes may be released
under the circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Brief description of the notes and the note
guarantees—The note guarantees.” The Issuers’ obligations under the notes and the guarantors’ obligations under
the guarantees are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries (or to those of any
subsidiary whose guarantee is voided as referred to above). Holders of notes will not have any claim as a creditor
against Virtu Financial’s subsidiaries that are not the Issuers or guarantors of the notes. Therefore, in the event of
any bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of a non-guarantor subsidiary, the rights of the holders of notes to
participate in the assets of such non-guarantor subsidiary will rank behind the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors,
including trade creditors (except to the extent we have a claim as a creditor of such subsidiary) and preferred
stockholders of such subsidiaries, if any.

Our non-guarantor subsidiaries, after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, in the aggregate,
excluding intercompany liabilities, would have had:

- approximately 85.0% of our consolidated assets and approximately 82.1% of our liabilities, as of March 31,
2024; and

- approximately 95.6% of our consolidated total revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

**_Repayment of the Issuers’ debt, including the notes, is dependent on cash flow generated by its subsidiaries._**

The Issuer is a holding company and has no direct operations other than holding the equity interests in its
subsidiaries and activities directly related thereto. Accordingly, repayment of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including
the notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by the Company’s subsidiaries and, if they are not guarantors
of the notes, their ability to make such cash available to the Issuer, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless
they are guarantors of the notes, the Company’s subsidiaries will not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the
notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The Company’s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be
permitted to, make distributions to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of its indebtedness, including the
notes. Each of the Company’s subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity, and under certain circumstances legal and
contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s ability to obtain cash from them, and the Company may be limited in
its ability to cause any future joint ventures to distribute their earnings to the Issuer. While the Indenture and the
Credit Agreement will limit the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability
to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to the Issuer, these limitations are subject to certain
qualifications and exceptions. In the event that the Issuer does not receive distributions from the Company’s
subsidiaries, the Issuer may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness,
including the notes.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the guarantees will be_**
**_released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the guarantees of the notes will be released automatically, including:

    - with respect to a subsidiary guarantor, a sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the assets of, or equity interests in, such subsidiary guarantor (other than to an Issuer or a guarantor) in
a transaction not prohibited under the Indenture;

    - if such subsidiary guarantor is designated an unrestricted subsidiary under the Indenture;

    - if that subsidiary guarantor becomes a Foreign Subsidiary, an Excluded Subsidiary, an Immaterial
Subsidiary, an Excluded Regulated Subsidiary or an Excluded Domestic Subsidiary (each as defined in
the Indenture);

    - upon the liquidation or dissolution of such subsidiary guarantor, provided that no default or event of
default shall occur as a result thereof or has occurred and is continuing; and

24


-----

    - a subsidiary guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security
interest by the applicable collateral agent or other exercise of remedies in respect thereof, in each case
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_The lenders under the Credit Facilities have the discretion to release the guarantors under the Credit Agreement_**
**_in a variety of circumstances, or such guarantors may be automatically released, which will cause those_**
**_guarantors to be automatically released from their guarantees of the notes._**

While any obligations under the Credit Facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee of the notes may be
released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the notes or the trustee under the Indenture, if the related
guarantor is no longer a guarantor of obligations under the Credit Facilities or any other first priority obligations
(other than in connection with the payment in full of first-priority obligations). The lenders under the Credit
Facilities have the discretion to release the guarantees under the Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances and,
in some circumstances, such guarantors will be automatically released. You will not have a claim as a creditor
against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor of the notes, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including
trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively be senior to claims of
noteholders.

**_We may be unable to finance a change of control offer._**

Upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change of control triggering events, including, if the notes
are rated investment grade by at least two of S&P Global Ratings (a division of S&P Global Inc.), Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch Ratings Inc., an attendant downgrade by at least two of such rating agencies to
below investment grade, the Issuer will be required to make an offer for cash to purchase the notes at 101% of their
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. However, we cannot assure you that the Issuer will have
the financial resources necessary to purchase the notes upon a change of control or that it will have the ability to
obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms, if at all. Further, the Credit Facilities contain an event of default
upon the Change in Control (as defined therein) which obligates the borrowers thereunder to repay indebtedness
outstanding under the Credit Facilities upon an acceleration of such indebtedness. As a result, the Issuer may not be
able to repurchase the notes and the Company and its subsidiaries may not be able to satisfy their respective
obligations under their other indebtedness following a change of control repurchase event in connection with the
notes. The Issuer’s failure to purchase the notes as required under the Indenture would result in a default under the
Indenture and a cross-default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as
leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a “Change of
Control” under the Indenture. See “Description of notes—Repurchase at the option of holders—Change of control.”

**_Investors may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the notes_**
**_repurchased by the Issuer has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

Legal uncertainty regarding what constitutes a change of control and the provisions of the Indenture may
allow us to enter into transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
change of control, but may increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our ability to satisfy our
obligations under the notes. A change of control, as defined in the Indenture, will require the Issuer to make an offer
to repurchase all outstanding notes. The definition of change of control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or
transfer of “all or substantially all” of our assets. There is no precisely established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a noteholder to require the Issuer to repurchase
their notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the Issuer’s assets to another individual, group or
entity may be uncertain.

**_Trading markets for the notes may not develop._**

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading markets. We do not intend to apply for
listing of the notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the notes on any automated dealer quotation
system.

25


-----

Certain of the initial purchasers have informed us that they currently intend to make a market in the notes.
However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any such market making at any time
without notice.

The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend upon various factors, including:

    - the number of holders of the notes;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes;

    - the overall market for high yield securities;

    - our financial performance or prospects; and

    - the prospects for companies in our industry generally.

Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a market or liquidity will develop for the notes. If an active trading
market for the notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected.

**_There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes without registration or the filing of a_**
**_prospectus under applicable securities laws, and the notes are not subject to any future registration rights. The_**
**_Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply with the_**
**_provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The notes are being issued pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and applicable
state and other securities laws. Therefore, you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a
transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment for an indefinite period of time. We will
not be obligated to offer to exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or to register the reoffer
and resale of notes under applicable securities laws. As a result, the transferability of the notes may be negatively
affected. By receiving the notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments, representations and
agreements as set forth under “Transfer restrictions.” In addition, the Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act and the Issuers will not be required to comply with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act.
Therefore, noteholders will not be entitled to the benefit of the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act
or similar provisions in the Indenture.

**_If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us in the United States, the allowed claim for the notes may be_**
**_less than the principal amount of the notes stated in the Indenture._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of
the notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount of the notes may be allowed in an amount
equal to the sum of:

- the original issue price of the notes; and

- that portion of the stated principal amount of the notes that exceeds the issue price of such notes, if any, that
does not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Accordingly, holders of the notes under these circumstances may receive an amount that is less than the principal
amount of the notes stated in the Indenture.

26


-----

**_If the notes are rated investment grade at any time by two of Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch’s, the_**
**_guarantees will be released and most of the restrictive covenants and corresponding events of default contained_**
**_in the Indenture will be suspended._**

If, at any time, the notes, as determined by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch’s Rating Services are
rated investment grade, or any equivalent replacement ratings, we will no longer be subject to most of the restrictive
covenants and corresponding events of default contained in the Indenture and the guarantees will be released. Any
restrictive covenants or corresponding events of default that cease to apply to use as a result of achieving these
ratings will be restored if the credit ratings on the notes from these ratings agencies no longer equal or exceed these
thresholds or in certain other circumstances. However, during any period in which these restrictive covenants are
suspended, we may incur other indebtedness, make restricted payments and take other actions that would have been
prohibited if these covenants had been in effect. If the restrictive covenants are later restored, the actions taken while
the covenants were suspended will not result in an event of default under the Indenture even if they would constitute
an event of default at the time the covenants are restored. Accordingly, if these covenants and corresponding events
of default are suspended, holders of the notes will have less credit protection than at the time the notes are issued.
The notes may never be rated investment grade, or if they are rated as investment grade, the notes may not maintain
such rating.

**_We may be unable to repay or repurchase the notes, or repay the Credit Facilities, at maturity._**

At maturity, the entire outstanding principal amount of the notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, will become due and payable. Additionally, the Credit Facilities will come due prior to the maturity date of
the notes. We may not have the funds to fulfill these obligations or the ability to renegotiate these obligations. If,
upon the applicable maturity date, other arrangements prohibit us from repaying the notes or the Credit Facilities, we
could try to obtain waivers of such prohibitions from the lenders and holders under those arrangements, or we could
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain the restrictions. In these circumstances, if we were not able to
obtain such waivers or refinance these borrowings, we would be unable to repay the notes or the Credit Facilities, as
applicable.

**_The market price for the notes may be volatile and may require you to hold the notes for an indefinite period of_**
**_time._**

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt, such as the notes, has been subject to disruptions
that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. Any market that may develop
for the notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any such disruptions may negatively impact the value of your
notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering
price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors. As a
result, you may be required to hold the notes for an indefinite period of time unless you are willing to sell the notes
for a loss.

**_We incur indebtedness from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including our trading, clearing,_**
**_stock and margin lending and repurchase arrangements. Claims you may have in respect of the notes will be_**
**_subordinated to the obligations and liabilities arising pursuant to such indebtedness, and such indebtedness may_**
**_place restrictions on our activities._**

We incur indebtedness from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including our trading,
clearing, stock and margin lending and repurchase arrangements. This indebtedness may be secured under
customary terms by marketable securities, financial instruments or similar or related assets or may be unsecured.
The terms of the Indenture will not restrict our ability to incur such indebtedness, which is referred to as “Trading
Debt” under “Description of notes” and includes debt incurred in the ordinary course of business by a broker-dealer
subsidiary, any subsidiary that is an operating regulated entity, a licensed mortgage subsidiary or a subsidiary
substantially all of whose business and operations are substantially similar to some or all of the business and
operations of the foregoing entities, in each case that is existing as of the date of the Indenture, and any subsidiary of
such entities.

27


-----

Holders of claims in respect of Trading Debt will be entitled to payment on their claims from assets
securing that debt or from other assets of our subsidiaries incurring such debt before those assets are made available
to us. Consequently, your claims in respect of the notes will be structurally subordinated to all of the existing and
future liabilities of our subsidiaries in respect of Trading Debt. Further, our subsidiaries may be subject to
affirmative and negative covenants pursuant to the terms of the Trading Debt, which may include restrictions on
certain activities of our subsidiaries that may extend to the ability to pay dividends or make distributions, make loans
and advances and transfer their property or assets, in each case to us and our subsidiaries.

**_The notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore holders must rely on the procedures of DTC to_**
**_exercise their rights and remedies._**

Unless and until notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in exchange
for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. DTC, or
its nominee, will be the registered holder of the global notes representing the notes. After payment to DTC’s
custodian, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the
owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of
DTC, and if you are not a participant in DTC, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your
interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the Indenture. See “Book-entry; delivery and form.”

Unlike the holders of the notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the notes. Instead, if you
own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do
so from DTC. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be
sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive
registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be
restricted to acting through DTC. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through DTC will be
adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Indenture. See “Book-entry; delivery and form.”

**_If the notes are issued with OID, and a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, the allowed claim for the_**
**_notes may be less than the principal amount of the notes stated in the Indenture._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after the issuance of
the notes, the claim by any holder of the notes for the principal amount thereof may be allowed in an amount equal
to the sum of:

  - the original issue price of the notes; and

  - that portion of the stated principal amount of the notes that exceeds the issue price thereof, if any, that does
not constitute “unmatured interest” for the purposes of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Any such discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing would constitute
unmatured interest, which is not allowable as part of a bankruptcy claim under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Accordingly, holders of the notes under these circumstances may receive an amount that is less than the principal
amount thereof stated in the Indenture.

**_The notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of the notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or equal to a
statutorily defined de minimis amount, the notes will be treated as issued with original issue discount for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (“OID”). If the notes are issued with OID, a holder of notes that is subject to U.S.
federal income taxation generally will be required to include such OID in gross income as ordinary income as it
accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally in advance of the receipt

28


-----

of the cash payments to which such OID is attributable and regardless of such holder’s regular method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

**Risks related to the collateral**

**_Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the collateral, the collateral agent_**
**_under the Credit Facilities will initially control actions with respect to that collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the collateral will be subject to the Intercreditor
Agreement among all holders of obligations secured by that collateral on a first-priority basis, including the
obligations under the Credit Facilities. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with
respect to the collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the
collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the collateral agent under the Credit
Agreement until the earlier of (1) the date on which our obligations under the Credit Facilities (or any refinancing
indebtedness in respect thereof) are no longer secured pursuant to the terms of the documents governing the Credit
Facilities or (2) 120 days after the occurrence of an event of default under any agreement governing first lien debt
other than the Credit Facilities (including the Indenture) that is continuing, if such debt represents the largest
outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral and such authorized
representative has complied with the applicable notice provisions so long as the collateral agent under the Credit
Agreement has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to collateral or none of the Issuers or the
guarantors is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding.

At any time that the collateral agent under the Credit Agreement does not have the right to direct the
actions with respect to the collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the right to direct such actions will
pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness
secured by a first lien on the collateral. If, in the future, we issue additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to
the lien securing the notes in a greater principal amount than the aggregate principal amount of the notes, then the
authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the
Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the collateral agent for the notes. Accordingly, the collateral agent for the notes
may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral.

Also, under the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of any
collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such collateral at any time prior to the discharge of
each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such collateral, proceeds, or
payment in trust for the other holders of first-priority obligations and promptly transfer such collateral, proceeds, or
payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations. See “Description of notes—
Security—Intercreditor agreement.”

The collateral securing the notes on a first-priority basis will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the authorized representative of the lenders
under the Credit Facilities or, if the Credit Facilities have been discharged, the authorized representative for the
series of first-priority lien obligations representing the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured
by a first priority lien on the collateral, during any period that such authorized representative controls actions with
respect to the collateral pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral
securing the notes as well as the ability of the collateral agent for the notes to realize or foreclose on such collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the collateral securing the notes. In addition, certain assets will be_**
**_excluded from the collateral._**

The value of the collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the
availability of suitable buyers. By their nature, some or all of the pledged assets may be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value. We cannot assure you that the fair market value of the collateral as of the date of
this offering memorandum equals or exceeds the principal amount of all of the debt secured thereby on a

29


-----

first-priority basis (including the obligations under the Credit Facilities). The value of the assets pledged as collateral
for the notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, our failure to implement
our business strategy, competition, unforeseen liabilities and other future events. Accordingly, there may not be
sufficient collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the
amount, if any, realized by noteholders from the sale of the collateral securing the notes and the obligations under
the notes and the other obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the notes will rank equally in right of payment
with all of our unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Additionally,
in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the collateral is less than the
amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and all other obligations secured by liens on the
collateral that are not junior to the liens securing the notes, interest, fees and expenses may cease to accrue on the
notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. See “—If we become the subject of a bankruptcy
proceeding, bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value from the collateral.”

The security interest of the collateral agent for the notes will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent for the notes may
need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you
that the collateral agent for the notes will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the
consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the
collateral agent for the notes may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the collateral
may significantly decrease.

In addition, the collateral securing the notes will be subject to other liens permitted under the Indenture,
whether arising on or after the date the notes are issued, such as liens securing purchase money indebtedness and
capital lease obligations, and assets subject to such liens will in certain circumstances be excluded from the
collateral. Such liens may be senior to or pari passu with the lien of the noteholders. The existence of any permitted
liens could materially and adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the notes, as well as the ability of the
collateral agent for the notes to realize or foreclose on such collateral.

Furthermore, not all of the Issuers’ and guarantors’ assets will secure the notes. See “Description of
notes—Security.” For example, the collateral will not include, among other things:

- fee-owned real property with a fair market value of less than $10 million or that is located in a federally
designated flood zone and all leasehold interests in real Property;

- motor vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title or ownership (to the extent that a security interest
in such asset cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing statement);

- commercial tort claims or letter of credit rights having a value of less than $10 million (to the extent that a
security interest in such asset cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing statement);

- those assets over which the pledging or granting of security interests in such assets would be prohibited by
applicable law, rule, regulation or certain contractual obligations (in each case, except to the extent such
prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to applicable anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code);

- leases, licenses or other agreements, to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein would violate or
invalidate such lease, license or agreement or create a right of termination in favor of any other party thereto (in
each case, except to the extent such prohibition is unenforceable after giving effect to applicable
anti-assignment provisions of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code);

- the assets of the broker-dealer subsidiaries, including any assets owned by Virtu Financial BD LLC, Virtu
Americas LLC, Virtu ITG LLC, Virtu Financial Capital Markets, Virtu Financial Ireland Limited, and any other
subsidiary where the pledging of such entity’s assets, or the entity’s guarantee of the obligations of another
person, would negatively affect the entity’s compliance with applicable capital requirements, although the
equity interests of such entities will, to the extent not themselves owned by such a regulated entity, be treated as

30


-----

collateral; or

- certain other assets.

Some of these assets may be material to us and such exclusion could have a material adverse effect on the
value of the collateral.

To the extent that the claims of the noteholders exceed the value of the assets securing the notes and other
obligations secured on a _pari passu basis with the notes, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the_
holders of any of our unsecured senior indebtedness. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the
notes and other obligations secured on a pari passu basis with the notes is less than the value of the claims of the
noteholders and such other obligations, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured
creditors are also paid in full.

**_Security over some of the collateral may not be in place on the date of the closing of this offering or may not be_**
**_perfected on such date, and any unresolved issues may impact the value of the collateral. Rights in the collateral_**
**_may be materially and adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in collateral now or in the_**
**_future._**

The collateral will include substantially all of the Issuers’ and the guarantors’ tangible and intangible
assets, whether now owned or acquired or arising in the future, subject to certain exceptions. Applicable law
provides that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected and its
priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. Certain security interests in the collateral
may not be in place on the date of the closing of this offering. The liens on certain collateral securing the notes may
not be perfected with respect to the claims of the notes if the collateral agent for the notes is not able to take the
actions necessary to perfect such liens on or prior to the date of the closing of this offering. We will be required to
file or cause to be filed financing statements under the Uniform Commercial Code to perfect the security interests
that can be perfected by such filings. We and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the security interest
of the noteholders in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements, delivery of certain stock
certificates and instruments, if permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, and filings with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office and the U.S. Copyright Office, as applicable, and other perfection actions required by the security
documents. We will be required to have all security interests that are required to be perfected by the security
documents to be in place within a specified period of time after the date of the closing of this offering. Any issues
that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may
negatively impact the value of the collateral. Even if we and/or the collateral agent for the notes do take all actions
necessary to create properly perfected security interests on collateral acquired in the future, any such security
interests that are perfected after the date of the Indenture would (as described further herein) remain at risk of being
avoided under certain circumstances as a preferential transfer or otherwise in any bankruptcy; to the extent a security
interest in certain collateral is not perfected on the date of the closing of this offering, such security interest might be
avoidable in bankruptcy as a preferential transfer or otherwise, which could impact the value of the collateral. See
“—If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value
from the collateral” below.

The Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the notes will not require us to
take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the collateral agent for the notes
for the benefit of the noteholders. As a result of these limitations, the security interest of the collateral agent for the
notes for the benefit of the noteholders in a portion of the collateral may not be perfected or enforceable (or may be
subject to other liens) under applicable law.

**_The security interests of the noteholders in after-acquired assets may not be perfected in a timely manner or at_**
**_all._**

If additional wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the
Indenture, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets
of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may

31


-----

be required to be taken to perfect the security interest in such assets, such as the delivery of physical collateral, if
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement, or the execution and recordation of mortgages or deeds of trust.
Applicable law provides that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such
as real property, certain intellectual property and other property and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the
time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The collateral agent for the notes will not monitor and has
no obligation to monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the collateral agent for the notes of, the
future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to
properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Such failure may result in the loss of the
security interest in the collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the collateral agent for the notes, as
applicable, against third parties. Even if the collateral agent for the notes does take all actions necessary to create
properly perfected security interests on collateral acquired in the future, any such security interests that are perfected
after the date of the Indenture would (as described further herein) remain at risk of being avoided under certain
circumstances as a preferential transfer or otherwise in any bankruptcy even after the security interests perfected on
the date of the closing of this offering were no longer subject to such risk. See “—Delivery of security interests in
collateral or any guarantees after the date of the closing of this offering increases the risk that such security interests
or guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy.”

**_The rights of noteholders to the collateral may be adversely affected by other issues generally associated with the_**
**_realization of security interests in collateral._**

The security interest of the collateral agent for the notes will be subject to practical challenges generally
associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the collateral agent for the notes may
need to obtain the consent of third parties or make additional filings. If we are unable to obtain these consents or
make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the noteholders will not be entitled to the collateral or
any recovery with respect to the collateral. The collateral agent for the notes may not be able to obtain any such
consent. Further, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such
collateral. Accordingly, the collateral agent for the notes may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets.
These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain collateral in any foreclosure or other
auction and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the collateral.
Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be
limited.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the collateral securing the_**
**_notes and guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the trustee._**

Under various circumstances, collateral securing the notes will be released automatically, including:

    - a sale, transfer or other disposition of such collateral (other than to an Issuer or a guarantor) in a
transaction not prohibited under the Indenture;

    - with respect to collateral held by a subsidiary guarantor, upon the release of such subsidiary guarantor
from its guarantee in a transaction not prohibited under the Indenture;

    - with respect to collateral held by an Issuer, upon the release or discharge of such Issuer’s obligations
under the notes pursuant to the Indenture in a transaction not prohibited under the Indenture;

    - pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to enforcement actions by the controlling
collateral agent under the Intercreditor Agreement.

The guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor will be automatically released to the extent it is released in
connection with a sale or other disposition of such subsidiary guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the
Indenture. The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a
subsidiary guarantor of the notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the subsidiary guarantee of such
guarantor being automatically released. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for
purposes of the Indenture, all of liens on any collateral owned by such subsidiary and any of its subsidiaries and any

32


-----

guarantees of the notes by such subsidiary and any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Indenture and under
the Credit Agreement and the aggregate value of the collateral securing the notes will be reduced. In addition, the
creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a claim on the assets of such unrestricted
subsidiary and its subsidiaries that is senior to the claim of the noteholders.

**_We will, in most cases, have control over the collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the notes and the guarantees._**

The security documents for the notes will allow us to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over,
freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the collateral securing the notes and the related
guarantees in the absence of the continuance of an event of default and an exercise of remedies by the holders of
liens on such collateral in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, we will not be required to
comply with all or any portion of the Trust Indenture Act, including, without limitation, Section 314(d) of the Trust
Indenture Act. See “Description of notes—Security.”

**_If we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, bankruptcy laws may limit your ability to realize value from_**
**_the collateral._**

The right of the collateral agent for the notes to foreclose upon, repossess, and dispose of the collateral
during the continuance of an event of default under the Indenture is likely to be significantly impaired (or at a
minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy law if a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against an Issuer
or a guarantor before the collateral agent for the notes repossessed and disposed of the collateral.

Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor such as the
collateral agent for the notes is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its collateral from a debtor in a
bankruptcy case, or from disposing of collateral previously repossessed from such debtor, without prior bankruptcy
court approval, which may not be given under the circumstances. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the
debtor to continue to retain and use cash and other collateral even though the debtor is in default under the
applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the
term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of
a secured creditor’s interest in its collateral as of the commencement of the bankruptcy case and may include cash
payments or the granting of additional or replacement collateral if and at such times as the bankruptcy court in its
discretion determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral is declining during the
pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require
compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures.

In view of the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary
power of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

    - whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a
bankruptcy case by an Issuer or a guarantor, or the length of any delay in making such payments;

    - whether or when the collateral agent for the notes could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral;

    - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition; or

    - whether or to what extent noteholders would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value
of the collateral through the requirement for “adequate protection.”

Any disposition of the collateral during a bankruptcy case would also require permission from the
bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances). Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court
determines the value of the collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on debt which is to be paid first out
of the proceeds of the collateral, the noteholders would hold a secured claim only to the extent of the value of the
collateral to which the noteholders are entitled and an unsecured claim with respect to any shortfall. The U.S.
Bankruptcy Code only permits the payment and accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and attorneys’ fees

33


-----

or “adequate protection” to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to the extent the value of its
collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the
obligations secured by the collateral, and such amounts would not be permitted to be paid if the collateral value is
not sufficient.

Also, the Intercreditor Agreement will impose various limitations on the noteholders with respect to their
rights to object to proposed debtor-in-possession financing or the use of cash collateral that has been consented to by
the lenders under the Credit Agreement. See “Description of notes—Security—Intercreditor agreement.”

**_Delivery of security interests in collateral or any guarantees after the date of the closing of this offering increases_**
**_the risk that such security interests or guarantees could be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Security interests in certain collateral, including certain after-acquired property, may be provided after the
date of the closing of this offering and certain guarantees may be granted after the date of the closing of this
offering. If the grantor of such security interest or such guarantor were to become subject to a bankruptcy case after
the date of the closing of this offering, any security interest in collateral or any guarantees delivered after the date of
the closing of this offering would face a greater risk than security interests or guarantees in place on the date of the
closing of this offering of being avoided by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor in possession) or by its trustee in
bankruptcy or potentially by other creditors as a preference under bankruptcy law if certain events or circumstances
exist or occur. Specifically, security interests or guarantees issued after the date of the closing of this offering may
be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were delivered to secure or guarantee previously existing indebtedness.
Any future pledge of collateral or future issuance of a guarantee in favor of the noteholders, including pursuant to
security documents or guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued, may be
avoidable as a preference if, among other circumstances, (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the
pledge or the issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or the issuance of the guarantee permits the noteholders to
receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given, and
(iii) a bankruptcy case in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or
the perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period
for “insiders.” Accordingly, if an Issuer or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the date of the
closing of this offering of the notes and (i) any liens granted after the date of the closing of this offering had been
perfected, or (ii) any guarantees issued after the date of the closing of this offering had been issued, less than 90 days
(or in some cases one year) before commencement of such bankruptcy case, such liens or guarantees are more likely
to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the date of the
closing of this offering. To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a
preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable).

**_In the event of a bankruptcy of the Issuers or any of the guarantors, noteholders may be deemed to have an_**
**_unsecured claim to the extent that the Issuers’ obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of_**
**_the collateral and the related guarantees._**

In any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Issuers or any of the guarantors, it is possible that the
bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the
collateral that secures the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing or some other date was less than the then-current
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes (after taking into account the other obligations secured by
first-priority liens on the collateral, including any outstanding under the Credit Facilities). Upon a finding by the
bankruptcy court that the notes are under-collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the
notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be
entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the noteholders would be
limited to the value of the collateral.

The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of
entitlement on the part of the noteholders to receive post-petition interest, fees, and expenses and a lack of
entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal
bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time
of such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a
reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes.

34


-----

**_The collateral is subject to casualty risks, which may limit your ability to recover as a secured creditor if there are_**
**_losses to the collateral, and which may have an adverse impact on our operations and results._**

We maintain insurance or otherwise insure against certain hazards in a manner appropriate and customary
for our business. There are, however, losses that may not be insured, either because they are uninsurable or not
economically insurable. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged collateral, we cannot assure you that
any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations, including the notes,
the indebtedness under the Credit Facilities and related guarantees. In the event of a total or partial loss affecting any
of our assets, certain items may not be easily replaced. Accordingly, even though there may be insurance coverage,
the extended period needed to obtain replacement units or inventory may cause significant delays, which may have
an adverse impact on our operations and results. In addition, certain zoning or other laws and regulations may
prevent rebuilding substantially the same facilities in the event of a loss, which may have an adverse impact on our
operations and results. Such adverse impacts may not be covered, or fully covered, by property or business
interruption insurance.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the collateral._**

Results of the lien searches on the collateral that will secure the notes and guarantees thereof have not yet
been obtained and we cannot guarantee that lien searches on the collateral that will secure the notes and guarantees
thereof will reveal any or all existing liens on such collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens,
could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and guarantees thereof and could have
an adverse effect on the ability of the collateral agent to realize or foreclose upon the collateral securing the notes
and guarantees thereof.

35

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the sale of the notes will be $500.0 million. We intend to use the proceeds from
this offering of the notes to repay $500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Existing Term
Loan Facility. If the closing of the Amended Credit Facilities is successfully consummated, we intend to use the
proceeds from the New Term Loan Facility to repay all remaining amounts outstanding under the Existing Term
Loan Facility. We intend to use cash on hand to pay discounts, fees, commissions and expenses of the offering of the
notes and the other Refinancing Transactions, as applicable. If the offering of the notes and the closing of the
Amended Credit Facilities are both successfully consummated, the Issuers expect to repay all outstanding amounts
under, and refinance, the Existing Term Loan Facility. The closing of the Amended Credit Facilities remains subject
to market and other customary conditions. The consummation of this offering is not contingent upon the closing of
the Amended Credit Facilities. The closing of the Amended Credit Facilities is not contingent upon the
consummation of this offering.

The following table sets forth the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Refinancing
Transactions. The following table and accompanying footnotes assume that (a) the offering of the notes is
consummated on the terms set forth herein, (b) we enter into the New Credit Facilities substantially concurrently
with the closing date of this offering and (c) all outstanding amounts under the Existing Term Loan Facility are
repaid and refinanced. The actual sources and uses of funds may vary from the estimated sources and uses of funds
in the table and accompanying footnotes set forth below. These estimated figures are based on our outstanding
balances as of March 31, 2024. The figures provided in the table below may not sum accurately due to rounding.
You should read the following together with the information under the sections titled “Summary—Refinancing
Transactions—Entry into Amended Credit Facilities,” “Summary—Refinancing Transactions—Refinancing of
Existing Term Loan Facility” and “Capitalization.”

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

For a description of the Existing Credit Agreement, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreement” of the
Annual Report.

The following summary of the material terms of certain financing arrangements that will remain
outstanding, upon the consummation of the Refinancing Transactions, does not purport to be complete and is subject
to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents. Certain of the terms for our Amended
Credit Facilities are subject to continuing negotiations between us and our prospective lenders and could change in
the definitive documentation for the Amended Credit Facilities and the descriptions contained herein.

**Long-term borrowings**

**_Amended Credit Facilities_**

_General_

We expect to enter into an amendment to our Existing Credit Agreement and close on the Amended Credit
Facilities on or about the Issue Date. The Amended Credit Agreement will provide for a first lien senior secured
term loan facility of $1,245 million (the “New Term Loan Facility”), and a first lien senior secured revolving facility
of $300 million available to the Issuer (the “Extended Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the New Term
Loan Facility, the “Amended Credit Facilities”). The Extended Revolving Credit Facility will include a $20 million
letter of credit sub-facility and a $20 million swingline sub-facility.

The New Term Loan Facility will mature in June 2031. The Extended Revolving Credit Facility will
mature in June 2027.

In addition, we may request one or more incremental term loan facilities, and/or one or more incremental
revolving credit facilities (collectively, “incremental facilities”) in an aggregate amount of up to (i) the greater of
$1,000 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) _plus_
(ii) additional amounts if certain leverage and/or fixed charge coverage tests are achieved, so long as, after giving
effect to such incremental facility, no default exists or would result therefrom, subject to certain conditions and
receipt of commitments by existing or additional lenders.

_Interest rates and fees_

The loans under the New Term Loan Facility (“Term Loans”) and the loans under the Extended Revolving
Credit Facility (“Revolving Loans”) will bear interest, at the borrower’s option, as follows: (A) at the Alternate Base
Rate plus a margin, in the case of Term Loans, and 2.50% per annum, in the case of Revolving Loans, subject to an
Alternate Base Rate “floor” of 1.0% per annum; or (B) at an adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate
(“SOFR”), including a SOFR adjustment of 0.10% in the case of Revolving Loans, plus a margin, in the case of
Term Loans, and 1.50% per annum, in the case of Revolving Loans, subject to a SOFR “floor” of 0% per annum.
Unused portions of the Extended Revolving Credit Facility are subject to a commitment fee equal to 0.50% per
annum, with stepdowns based on certain net first lien leverage tests set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement. We
will also be required to pay customary letter of credit and agency fees under the Amended Credit Facilities.

_Amortization and prepayments_

The New Term Loan Facility will require scheduled annual amortization payments on each anniversary of
the closing of the Term Loans in an amount equal to 1.0% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term
Loans, with the balance to be paid at maturity.

In addition, the New Term Loan Facility will require us to prepay the outstanding Term Loans, subject to
certain exceptions, with:

39


-----

- 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% or 0% based on certain net first lien leverage ratio tests set forth
in the Amended Credit Agreement) of our quarterly excess cash flow, to be defined in manner that is
substantially consistent with the Existing Credit Facilities;

- 100% (which percentage will be reduced to 50% or 0% based on certain net first lien leverage tests set forth in
the Amended Credit Agreement) of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales and other
dispositions of property, including casualty events, in each case subject to certain reinvestment rights and
certain other exceptions; and

- 100% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted
under the Amended Credit Agreement.

We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under Amended Credit Facilities at any time, without
prepayment premium or penalty, except in connection with a repricing event in respect of the Term Loans as
described below, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to SOFR loans.

Any prepayment or refinancing of Term Loans through the issuance of certain debt or any repricing
amendment, in either case, that constitutes a “repricing transaction” applicable to the Term Loans resulting in a
lower yield occurring at any time prior to the six-month anniversary of the Term Loan Closing Date will be
accompanied by a 1.00% prepayment premium.

_Collateral and guarantors_

All obligations under the Amended Credit Facilities will be unconditionally guaranteed by Virtu Financial
and each of our existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to
certain exceptions, including exceptions for our broker-dealer subsidiaries and certain immaterial subsidiaries. The
obligations will be secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and those of Virtu Financial and each
subsidiary guarantor, including capital stock of the subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the voting capital stock and
100% of the non-voting capital stock of the first-tier foreign subsidiaries, in each case subject to exceptions. Subject
to permitted liens and certain other exceptions, such security interests consist of a first-priority lien with respect to
the collateral securing the Amended Credit Facilities.

_Restrictive covenants and other matters_

If the usage under our Extended Revolving Credit Facility exceeds a specified level at the end of any fiscal
quarter, the Extended Revolving Credit Facility will require us to maintain a maximum net first lien leverage ratio of
3.75 to 1.0 as of the end of such fiscal quarter.

The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants. The negative covenants
in the Amended Credit Agreement include, among other things, limitations on our ability to do the following,
subject to certain exceptions and baskets set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement:

- incur additional debt;

- create liens on certain assets;

- make certain loans or investments (including acquisitions);

- pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted junior payments;

- consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;

- sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including equity interests in our subsidiaries;

- enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;

40


-----

- enter into swaps, forwards and similar agreements; and

- modify the terms of certain debt agreements.

The Amended Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default, including relating to a
change of control. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders under the Amended Credit Facilities
are entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Amended Credit Facilities
and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor in respect of the collateral securing the Amended Credit
Facilities.

**_SBI Bonds_**

On July 25, 2016, the Issuer issued Japanese Yen bonds in the aggregate principal amount of ¥3.5 billion
($33.1 million at issuance date) to SBI Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and SBI Insurance Co., Ltd. The proceeds from the
SBI Bonds were used to partially fund the investment in Japannext Co., Ltd. (“Japannext”) (as described in Note 9
to the financial statements included in Virtu’s Quarterly Report). The SBI Bonds are guaranteed by Virtu Financial.
The SBI Bonds are subject to fluctuations on the Japanese Yen currency rates relative to the Company’s reporting
currency (U.S. dollar) with the changes reflected in other, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive
income. In December 2022, the maturity date of the SBI Bonds was extended from January 2023 to January 2026.
The principal balance was ¥3.5 billion ($23.1 million) as of March 31, 2024. We recorded a gain of $1.7 million
and $0.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to changes in foreign
currency rates. We recorded gains of $1.9 million, $4.0 million and $3.2 million during the years ended December
31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to changes in foreign currency rates.

**_Broker-dealer credit facilities_**

We are a party to two secured credit facilities with the same financial institution to finance overnight
securities positions purchased as part of our ordinary course broker-dealer market-making activities. One of the
facilities (the “Uncommitted Facility”) is provided on an uncommitted basis and is available for borrowings by our
broker-dealer subsidiaries up to a maximum amount of $400.0 million. The loans provided under the Uncommitted
Facility are collateralized by our broker-dealer trading and deposit accounts with the same financial institution and,
bear interest at a rate set by the financial institution on a daily basis (6.50% at March 31, 2024 and December 31,
2023, 5.50% at December 31, 2022 and 1.25% at December 31, 2021).

We are also a party to a facility (the “Committed Facility”) with the same financial institution dated as of
March 1, 2019, as amended, which is provided on a committed basis and is available for borrowings by our
broker-dealer subsidiaries up to a maximum amount of $650.0 million. The Committed Facility consists of two
borrowing bases: Borrowing Base A Loan is to be used to finance the purchase and settlement of securities; and
Borrowing Base B Loan is to be used to fund margin deposit with the National Securities Clearing Corporation.
Borrowing Base A Loans are available up to $650.0 million, which bear interest at the adjusted SOFR or base rate
plus 1.25% per annum. Borrowing Base B Loans are currently subject to a sublimit of $300.0 million, and bear
interest at the adjusted SOFR or base rate plus 2.50% per annum. A commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the
average daily unused portion of the Committed Facility is payable quarterly in arrears. The Committed Facility
requires, among other items, maintenance of minimum total regulatory capital, maximum total assets to regulatory
capital ratio and minimum excess net capital.

On May 25, 2022, Virtu Financial Singapore Pte. Ltd. entered into a revolving credit facility with a
financial institution (the “Overdraft Facility”) to provide a source of short-term financing. The facility has an
aggregate borrowing limit of $10 million, and bears interest at the adjusted SOFR or base rate plus 3.5% per annum.

**Prime brokerage credit facilities**

We maintain short-term credit facilities with various prime brokers and other financial institutions from
which we receive execution and/or clearing services (the “Short Term Facilities”). The proceeds of these Short Term
Facilities are used to meet margin requirements associated with the products traded by us in the ordinary course, and

amounts borrowed are collateralized by our trading accounts with the applicable financial institution. Borrowings
bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 7.83%, 7.96%, 7.42% and 2.91% per annum, as of March 31,
2024, December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Interest expense in relation to
the Short Term Facilities was $2.6 million and $3.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, and $13.1 million, $9.3 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and
2021, respectively.

**Short-term overdraft facilities**

Our international securities clearance and settlement activities are funded with operating cash or with shortterm bank loans in the form of overdraft facilities. At March 31, 2024, there was no balance (December 31, 2023: no
balance; December 31, 2022: $3.9 million) associated with international settlement activities outstanding under
these facilities (at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.8% at December 31, 2022). These short-term
bank loan balances are included within short-term borrowings in our consolidated statement of financial condition.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading “—Certain
Definitions.” Defined terms used in this description but not defined under “—Certain Definitions” have the
meanings assigned to them in the indenture. In this description, (i) the terms “Holdings,” “we” or “us” refer to Virtu
Financial LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (ii) the term “VFH” refers to VFH Parent LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a direct Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Holdings, (iii) the term “Co-Issuer” refers to
Valor Co-Issuer, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of VFH, and (iv) the terms “Issuer”
and “Issuers” refer collectively to VFH and the Co-Issuer.

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date, among itself, the
Co-Issuer, the Guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the
“trustee”) and collateral agent (in such capacity, the “collateral agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The indenture will not be qualified
under the Trust Indenture Act (“TIA”). The indenture will only include terms expressly provided for in the indenture
and will not incorporate any additional terms from the TIA. The Collateral Documents referred to below under the
caption “—Security” will define the terms of the agreements that will secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the indenture and the Collateral
Documents. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We urge you to read the indenture and the
Collateral Documents because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes.

For all purposes under the indenture, in connection with any Delaware LLC Division (or any comparable
event under any applicable jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes
the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the
original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be
deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders
will have rights under the indenture.

**Brief description of the notes and the note guarantees**

**_The notes_**

The Notes:

    - will be general obligations of VFH and the Co-Issuer and will be secured by a Lien, subject to
Permitted Liens, on each Issuer’s existing and future property and assets, other than Excluded
Property;

    - will rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuers,
including the Senior Credit Facilities, before giving effect to Collateral arrangements;

    - will rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the
Issuers;

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is secured
by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets;

    - will be effectively senior to all Indebtedness of the Issuers that is not secured by a Lien on the
Collateral or that is secured by a Lien ranking junior to the Lien on the Collateral securing the Notes,
to the extent of the value of such assets;

    - will be equal with all of the existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is secured by the

43


-----

Collateral on a first lien basis, including the Senior Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral securing such Indebtedness;

    - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of each
subsidiary of the Issuers that is not a Guarantor; and

    - will be unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” other than (i) RFQ-hub
Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (ii) RFQ-hub Europe BV, a private company with limited
liability organized under the laws of the Netherlands, (iii) RFQ-hub International Limited, a limited company
organized under the laws of Ireland, (iv) RFQ-hub Americas LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (v) RFQhub Asia-Pacific Private Limited, a private limited company organized under the laws of Singapore and (vi) RFQhub Software Solutions (France) SAS (f/k/a Virtu ITG Software Solutions (France) SAS), a simplified stock
company organized under the laws of France, all of which Subsidiaries are designated as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”
under the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, under the circumstances described below, we will be permitted to
designate additional Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to
many of the restrictive covenants in the indenture. Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes.

**_The note guarantees_**

Holdings and each of the Subsidiaries of Holdings that is a guarantor under the Senior Credit Facilities
(other than the Issuers) on the Issue Date and each of the Subsidiaries of Holdings that is required to guarantee
payment of the Notes in accordance with the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Additional note
guarantees” will jointly and severally guarantee on a senior secured basis the full and prompt payment of the
Issuers’ payment obligations under the Notes and the indenture. Any Guarantor that makes a payment under its Note
Guarantee will be entitled upon payment in full of all guaranteed obligations under the indenture to a contribution
from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other Guarantor’s pro rata portion of such payment based on
the respective net assets of all the Guarantors at the time of such payment determined in accordance with GAAP.
The obligations of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that Note
Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our
indebtedness and the notes—Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes and similar laws may
permit courts, under specific circumstances, to avoid the notes and the guarantees related to the notes, to require
noteholders to return payments received from us or the guarantors, and to take other actions detrimental to the
noteholders.”

Each Note Guarantee of a Guarantor:

    - will be a senior secured obligation of that Guarantor;

    - will be secured by a Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on that Guarantor’s existing and future property
and assets, other than Excluded Property;

    - will rank _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of that_
Guarantor, including the Senior Credit Facilities, before giving effect to Collateral arrangements;

    - will be senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of that
Guarantor.

    - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets;

    - will be effectively senior to all Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not secured by a Lien on the
Collateral or that is secured by a Lien ranking junior to the Lien on the Collateral securing the Notes,
to the extent of the value of such assets;

44


-----

    - will be equal with all of the existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor that is secured by the
Collateral on a first lien basis, including the Senior Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral securing such Indebtedness; and

    - will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of each
subsidiary of that Guarantor that is not a Guarantor.

Our business is principally conducted through our Subsidiaries. Not all of our Subsidiaries will guarantee
the Notes. The Notes and Note Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities, including trade
payables and preferred stock, of our Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the
holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to us. On an as
adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-guarantor Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, excluding
intercompany liabilities, would have accounted for: (i) approximately 85.0% of our consolidated assets and
approximately 82.1% of our liabilities, in each case, as of March 31, 2024; and (ii) approximately 95.6%, of our
consolidated total revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our
indebtedness and the notes—The notes will be structurally subordinated to the obligations of Virtu Financial’s
non-guarantor subsidiaries. Your right to receive payment on the notes could be adversely affected if any of our
non-guarantor subsidiaries declares bankruptcy, liquidates or reorganizes.”

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released:

(1) only with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, as result of any sale, distribution or other
disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of such Guarantor or in connection with any sale
or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Subsidiary Guarantor (including by way of
merger or consolidation) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction)
Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the
provisions set forth under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) only with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, in connection with any sale or other
disposition of the Equity Interests of that Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after
giving effect to such transaction) Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings or any other sale,
issuance or disposition of Equity Interests of that Subsidiary Guarantor that causes it to cease to be a
Subsidiary of Holdings, in each case, if the sale, issuance or other disposition does not violate the
provisions set forth under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(3) if Holdings designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Guarantor to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the indenture;

(4) only with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, if that Subsidiary Guarantor becomes a
Foreign Subsidiary, an Excluded Subsidiary, an Immaterial Subsidiary, an Excluded Regulated Subsidiary
or an Excluded Domestic Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the indenture;

(5) only with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, if that Subsidiary Guarantor is released or
discharged of its guarantee of Indebtedness (other than as a result of payment thereon by such Guarantor
following a default by the direct obligor of such Indebtedness) under the guarantee that resulted or would
have resulted in the obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor to provide a Notes Guarantee if such
Subsidiary Guarantor would not then otherwise be required to provide a Notes Guarantee;

(6) only with respect to a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon the liquidation or dissolution of such
Subsidiary Guarantor in a manner not in violation of the applicable provisions of the indenture ;

(7) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture
as provided below under the captions “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction
and Discharge”;

45


-----

(8) upon the full and final payment of the Notes and performance of all Obligations of the
Issuers and the Guarantors under the indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees;

(9) as described under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”;

(10) as result of any transaction permitted under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of Assets” and the paragraph below;

(11) a Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any foreclosure of any
pledge or security interest by the Applicable Collateral Agent (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) or
other exercise of remedies in respect thereof, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(12) upon the commencement of a Suspension Period; _provided that upon a Reinstatement_
Date such Guarantors shall be required to execute Guarantees in accordance with the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Additional note guarantees”.

The trustee shall take all necessary actions at the request of the Issuers to effectuate any release of a Note
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions. Each of the releases set forth above (other than in sub-paragraph (9))
shall be effected by the trustee without the consent of the holders and will not require any other action or consent on
the part of the trustee.

Subject to certain provisions in the indenture governing release of assets and property securing the Notes
and release of a Note Guarantee upon the sale or disposition of a Subsidiary Guarantor, a Subsidiary Guarantor may
not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or into
(whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than Holdings, an Issuer or
another Subsidiary Guarantor, unless either:

(a) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person
formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger unconditionally assumes all the
obligations of that Subsidiary Guarantor under the indenture, its Note Guarantee and appropriate
Collateral Documents; or

(b) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger is not in
violation of the covenant described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales”;

The successor Person (if not such Subsidiary Guarantor) will be the successor in interest to such Subsidiary
Guarantor and shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, such Subsidiary
Guarantor under the indenture, and the predecessor guarantor shall be released from its Notes Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)(a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or merge with or into or
sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Issuer or any Guarantor and (b) any Guarantor may consolidate or merge with or into or sell, assign, transfer, lease,
convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries to any Issuer or another Guarantor and (y) any Guarantor may
consolidate or merge with or into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such Guarantor, reincorporating such Guarantor in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of
such Guarantor.

**Principal, maturity and interest**

The Issuers will issue $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes in this offering. The Issuers
may issue additional notes under the indenture from time to time after this offering. Any issuance of additional notes
is subject to all of the covenants in the indenture, including the covenants described below under the caption “—

46


-----

Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—
Liens.” The Notes and any additional notes subsequently issued under the indenture will be treated as a single class
for all purposes under the indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
purchase. However, additional notes may have a different issue price, and if any additional notes are not fungible
with the Notes for federal income tax purposes, they will have a different CUSIP number or numbers and will be
represented by a different global Note or Notes. Any additional notes issued after this offering will be secured by the
Collateral, equally and ratably, with the Notes. As a result, the issuance of additional notes will have the effect of
diluting the security interest of the Collateral for the then outstanding Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires,
for all purposes of the indenture and this “Description of Notes,” references to “Notes” include any additional notes
actually issued.

The Issuers will issue Notes in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The Notes will mature on        , 2031.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of     % per annum and will be payable semi-annually in
arrears on         and        , commencing on        , 2024. The Issuers will make each interest payment
to the holders of record on the immediately preceding     and      .

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid,
from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months. If any scheduled interest payment date is not a business day, the interest payment in respect
of such scheduled interest payment date shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a business day, and no
interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

**Methods of receiving payments on the notes**

If a holder of Notes has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuers, the Issuers will pay all principal,
interest and premium, if any, on that holder’s Notes in accordance with those instructions. All other payments on the
Notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent and registrar unless the Issuers elect to make interest
payments by check mailed to the holders of the Notes at their address set forth in the register of holders.

**Paying agent and registrar for the notes**

The trustee will initially act as paying agent and registrar. The Issuers may change the paying agent or
registrar without prior notice to the holders of the Notes, and Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying
agent or registrar.

**Transfer and exchange**

A holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the provisions of the indenture. The registrar
and the trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The
Issuers will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption. Also, the Issuers will not be
required to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days before the delivery of a notice of redemption of
Notes to be redeemed or between a record date and the relevant interest payment date.

**Security**

**_General_**

The Issuers and the Guarantors will be required to cause the collateral agent (for the benefit of the collateral
agent, the trustee and the holders of the Notes) to be granted valid and perfected first priority Liens, subject to
Permitted Liens, on:

(1) substantially all personal property of the Issuers and the Guarantors;

47


-----

(2) all Equity Interests of the Issuers, the Guarantors (other than Holdings) and the direct
Subsidiaries of the Issuers and the Guarantors and all intercompany notes owed to any Issuer or any of the
Guarantors by any Issuer, the Guarantors or any of their respective Subsidiaries; and

(3) all proceeds of the foregoing;

_provided that the Collateral shall not include any Excluded Property. In addition, the Collateral will not include the_
property and assets of any of our Subsidiaries that is not a Guarantor.

The Issuers, the Guarantors, the trustee and the collateral agent will enter into each of the Collateral
Documents defining the terms of the security interests that secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In connection
therewith the Issuers and the Guarantors shall:

(1) take all actions required under the indenture or Collateral Documents in order to cause
the collateral agent (for the benefit of the collateral agent, the trustee and the holders of the Notes) to have
valid and perfected Liens on the Collateral that are pari passu in priority with the Issuers’ other First Lien
Obligations, if any, subject to Permitted Liens;

(2) take such further action and execute and deliver such other documents specified in the
Indenture Documents or as otherwise may be reasonably requested by the trustee or collateral agent to give
effect to the foregoing; and

(3) deliver to the trustee and the collateral agent an Opinion of Counsel that (i) such
Collateral Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuers and the Guarantors
and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors, subject to
customary qualifications and limitations, and (ii) the Collateral Documents create valid and perfected Liens
on the Collateral covered thereby, subject to Permitted Liens and customary qualifications and limitations.

So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and subject to certain terms and
conditions, the Issuers and the Guarantors will be entitled to remain in possession and retain exclusive
control over the Collateral, to receive all cash dividends, interest and other payments made upon or with
respect to the Collateral, to invest and dispose of any income therefrom and to exercise any voting and
other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, subject to the terms of the
applicable Collateral Documents:

(1) all rights of the Issuers and the Guarantors to receive all cash dividends, interest and other
payments made upon or with respect to the Collateral will cease and such cash dividends, interest and other
payments will be paid to the collateral agent;

(2) all voting or other consensual rights pertaining to the Collateral will become vested solely
in the collateral agent and the right of the Issuers and the Guarantors to exercise any such voting and
consensual rights will cease in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents; and

(3) the collateral agent may distribute or sell the Collateral or any part of the Collateral in
accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents.

The Liens created by the indenture and the Collateral Documents to secure the obligations of the Issuers
and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically, without the need for any
further action by any Person, upon (1) the full and final payment and performance of the Obligations of the Issuers
and the Guarantors under the indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees; (2) legal or covenant defeasance
pursuant to the provisions set forth under the caption “—Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance” or discharge of
the indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under the caption “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; or (3) the
consent of holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

48


-----

In addition, the collateral agent will release automatically, without the need for any further action by any
Person, from the Liens securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees created by the Collateral Documents:

(1) Collateral that is sold, transferred, disbursed or otherwise disposed of to a Person other
than an Issuer or a Guarantor to the extent such sale, transfer, disbursement or disposition is not prohibited
by the provisions of the indenture; _provided that any products or proceeds received by an Issuer or a_
Guarantor in respect of any such Collateral shall continue to constitute Collateral to the extent required by
the indenture and the Collateral Documents;

(2) the property and assets of a Guarantor upon the release of such Guarantor from its Note
Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the indenture;

(3) any property or asset of an Issuer or a Guarantor that is or becomes Excluded Property;
and

(4) to the extent, if any, required by the Intercreditor Agreement;

_provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of the indenture or the Collateral Documents, except as_
provided in clause (4) above, Liens securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees on all or substantially all of the
Collateral may be released only pursuant to the terms of the previous paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, whenever the trustee or collateral agent is asked
to execute a release, the Issuers shall deliver an Opinion of Counsel and Officer’s Certificate stating that all
conditions precedent to such release in the Indenture Documents have been complied with and such release is
permitted by the Indenture Documents.

Certain security interests in the Collateral may not be in place on the date of the indenture or may not be
perfected on the date of the indenture or the date of acquisition in the future. For example, some of the instruments
and other documents required to perfect a security interest may not be delivered and/or, if applicable, recorded on or
prior to such date. To the extent any such security interest is not perfected by such date, the Issuers and the
Guarantors will use their commercially reasonable efforts to perform all acts and things that may be required,
including obtaining any required consents from third parties, to have all security interests in the Collateral duly
created and enforceable and perfected, to the extent required by the Collateral Documents, promptly following the
date of the indenture or acquisition (but within 90 days following the Issue Date). See “Risk Factors—Risks related
to the collateral—Security over some of the collateral may not be in place on the date of the closing of this offering
or may not be perfected on such date, and any unresolved issues may impact the value of the collateral. Rights in the
collateral may be materially and adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in collateral now or in
the future.” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to the collateral—The security interests of the noteholders in
after-acquired assets may not be perfected in a timely manner or at all.” In addition, the Issuers and the Guarantors
will not be required to: (a) cause the collateral agent (or its bailee) to have possession of instruments or tangible
chattel paper that does not exceed $10.0 million; (b) provide the collateral agent with control agreements or other
control or similar arrangements with respect to deposit accounts, securities accounts, letter of credit rights or other
assets which are required to or may be perfected by control (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, possession); or
(c) obtain landlord lien waivers, estoppels and collateral access letters. Further, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall
not be required to make any filings or take any actions in any jurisdiction outside the United States (or otherwise
enter into any security agreements, mortgages or pledge agreements governed by the laws of any jurisdiction outside
of the United States) in respect of the Collateral.

No appraisals of any Collateral have been prepared in connection with this offering of Notes. The value of
the Collateral at any time will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of
suitable buyers for the Collateral. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no
assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay any
of the Issuers’ Obligations under the Notes or any of the Guarantors’ Obligations under the Note Guarantees, in full
or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral
securing the notes. In addition, certain assets will be excluded from the collateral.”

49


-----

In addition, because a portion of the Collateral may consist of pledges of a portion of the Equity Interests of
certain of our Foreign Subsidiaries, the validity of those pledges under applicable foreign law, and the ability of the
holders of Notes to realize upon that Collateral under applicable foreign law, to the extent applicable, may be limited
by such law, which limitations may or may not affect such Liens.

If the net proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the other
First Lien Obligations, including the Senior Credit Facilities, the holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from
the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the remaining assets of the
Issuers and the Guarantors. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the collateral—In the event of a bankruptcy of the
Issuers or any of the guarantors, noteholders may be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the
Issuers’ obligations in respect of the notes exceed the fair market value of the collateral and the related guarantees.”

The Issuers and the Guarantors will be able to incur other Indebtedness in the future, which may be secured
by the Collateral, and the Issuers may incur other First Lien Obligations in the future. The amount of such additional
Indebtedness will be limited by the covenants described under “—Certain covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness
and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Certain covenants—Liens.” The amount of such additional Indebtedness
could be significant. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and the notes—Despite our substantial
indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured debt, which could intensify the
risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.”

**_After-acquired property; assets subject to liens_**

If an Issuer or any Guarantor acquires any After-Acquired Property (including any owned (but not leased)
real property or improvements thereto or any interest therein (x) with a fair market value in excess of $10.0 million
(as determined by Holdings at the time of acquisition thereof) and (y) that is not located in a “flood zone” (as
determined by Holdings)) or if any material assets or property that would have constituted Collateral had such assets
and property been owned by an Issuer or Guarantor on the Issue Date are held by any Subsidiary on or after the time
it becomes a Guarantor (other than assets constituting Excluded Property or constituting Collateral under a
Collateral Document that becomes subject to the Lien created by such Collateral Document upon acquisition
thereof), the Issuers will notify the collateral agent and will cause such assets to be subjected to a Lien securing the
Indenture Obligations and the other First Lien Obligations and will take, and cause the Guarantors to take, such
actions as shall be required under the indenture and Collateral Documents to grant and perfect such Liens, all at the
expense of the Issuers and the Guarantors, and thereupon all provisions of the indenture relating to the Collateral
shall be deemed to relate to such assets to the same extent and with the same force and effect.

Each Issuer and each Guarantor agrees that, in the event it takes any action to grant or perfect a Lien to
secure any other First Lien Obligations in any assets, such Issuer or such Guarantor shall also take such action to
grant or perfect a Lien (subject to the Intercreditor Agreement) in favor of the collateral agent to secure the
Indenture Obligations without the request of the collateral agent.

**_Information regarding collateral_**

The Issuers will furnish to the collateral agent, with respect to an Issuer or any Guarantor, prompt (and in
any event within 30 days or such longer period reasonably agreed to by the Applicable Collateral Agent) written
notice of any change in such Person’s (i) legal name, (ii) the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization or in the
form of its organization or (iii) organizational identification number. The Issuers and the Guarantors agree to make
such filings and take such actions in connection with any such change such that the collateral agent will continue at
all times following such change to have a valid, legal and perfected security interest in all the Collateral to the extent
contemplated by the Collateral Documents, with the priority required by the Intercreditor Agreement.

Each year, at the time of delivery of the annual report required by clause (1) of the first paragraph under
“Certain Covenants—Reports,” the Issuers shall deliver to the trustee and the collateral agent an updated perfection
certificate consistent with the perfection certificate delivered on the Issue Date or confirming that there has been no
change in such information since the date of the perfection certificate delivered on the Issue Date or the date of the
most recent certificate delivered pursuant to this covenant.

**_Intercreditor agreement_**

On the Issue Date, each of the trustee and the collateral agent will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the
“Intercreditor Agreement”), on behalf of itself and the other Notes Secured Parties, with the Senior Credit Facility
Agent, on behalf of itself and Senior Credit Facility Secured Parties. The Intercreditor Agreement will, among other
things, define the relative rights and related matters of the First Lien Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral.
The following description is a summary of the principal terms that are expected to be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement, rather than a complete and definitive description of such terms.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or
refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The “Applicable Collateral Agent” means (i) until the
earlier of (x) the Discharge of Credit Agreement Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative
Enforcement Date, the Senior Credit Facility Agent and (ii) from and after the earlier of (x) the Discharge of Credit
Agreement Obligations and (y) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Additional
First Lien Collateral Agent holding the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations represented by the Major NonControlling Authorized Representative. The Applicable Collateral Agent will initially be the Senior Credit Facility
Agent and the collateral agent will have no rights to take any action under the Intercreditor Agreement with respect
to the Shared Collateral unless and until it becomes the Applicable Collateral Agent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the trustee and each other
Authorized Representative or any other First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest
with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such First Lien Secured Party; (ii) the trustee and each other
Authorized Representative or any other First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action
to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such parties, provided that no
such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the Liens granted in
favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other Controlling
Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) the trustee and each other Authorized Representative or any First Lien Secured
Party may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or
other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such
party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

With respect to any Shared Collateral, (i) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall act only on the instructions
of the Applicable Authorized Representative, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not be required to follow any
instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with
respect to any Shared Collateral) from any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative (or any other First Lien
Secured Party other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) and (iii) no Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative or other First Lien Secured Party (other than the Applicable Authorized Representative) shall, or
shall instruct the Applicable Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings
with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, or otherwise take
any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any
Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral),
whether under any First Lien Security Document, applicable law or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing each Series of First Lien
Obligations, the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized
Representative) may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Applicable Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on
such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest,
protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable
Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Applicable Collateral
Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies
relating to the Shared Collateral, or to cause the Applicable Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien Secured
Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) question or contest or support any other person in
contesting, in any proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the perfection, priority,

51


-----

validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties on all or
any part of the Shared Collateral, or the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of First Lien
Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Applicable Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is
taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any
Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of either Issuer or any Guarantor (including any
adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor
agreement (other than the Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale,
collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any First Lien Secured Party or received by the Applicable
Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such
Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution or payment (subject, in the case of any such distribution,
proceeds, or payment, to the immediately following sentence and the second following paragraph) (all such
payments, proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Collateral and all proceeds of any such
distribution being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the
payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to each
Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any documents governing First Lien Obligations;
_provided that following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to any Issuer_
or Guarantor, solely as among the holders of First Lien Obligations and solely for purposes of the applicable
waterfall provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and not any documents governing First Lien Obligations, in the
event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First
Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable
provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the
amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of
Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code
or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral upon which a third
party (other than a First Lien Secured Party) has a Lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security
interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case
of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening
Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or Proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor shall be
deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of
First Lien Obligations with respect to which such impairment exists.

Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens
securing any Series of First Lien Obligations granted on the Shared Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of
the Uniform Commercial Code of any jurisdiction, or any other applicable law or the First Lien Documents or any
defect or deficiencies in the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations of any Series or any other circumstance
whatsoever (but, in each case, subject to the immediately following paragraph), each First Lien Secured Party will
agree that the Liens securing each Series of First Lien Obligations on any Shared Collateral shall be of equal
priority.

It is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series that the holders of First Lien Obligations
of such Series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other Series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a
court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under
applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations),
(y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the
Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists
securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the
security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First
Lien Obligations or (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not
Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of First
Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series); provided that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to
mortgaged property which applies to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any
Series of First Lien Obligations. In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations,
the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations, and the

52


-----

rights of the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligations set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be
modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series
of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of
any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the
Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the First Lien Documents governing such First
Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the First Lien Secured Parties may (i) challenge or question in any proceeding (including any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding) the validity or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of any Series or
any First Lien Security Document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under any First Lien
Security Document or the validity or enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or other
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) take or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is,
or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared
Collateral by the Applicable Collateral Agent, (iii) except as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement, have a right to
(A) direct the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to exercise any right, remedy or
power with respect to any Shared Collateral (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement) or (B) consent to the
exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party of any right, remedy or power
with respect to any Shared Collateral, (iv) institute in any suit, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or other
proceeding any claim against the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking
damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared
Collateral, (v) seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshalled upon any foreclosure or other
disposition of such Collateral and (vi) attempt, directly or indirectly, to challenge the enforceability of any provision
of the Intercreditor Agreement; provided that nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be construed to prevent or
impair the rights of the Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party to enforce the Intercreditor
Agreement.

If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or
payment in respect thereof pursuant to any First Lien Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to
it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies
(including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the First Lien
Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured
Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Applicable Collateral Agent to be
distributed in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or
otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether
or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the Applicable
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the trustee and the holders of the Notes and each other Series of First Lien
Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to
the extent, such Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged.
However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of
any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, any other Bankruptcy Law or similar law by
or against Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if any Issuer or
Guarantor becomes subject to a case under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable Bankruptcy Law and shall,
as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders
(the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable
Bankruptcy Law and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent
provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law, each First Lien Secured Party (other than any Controlling
Secured Party or authorized representative of any Controlling Secured Party) will agree that it will raise no objection
to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to
any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless an Authorized Representative of any Controlling
Secured Party shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash
collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral

53


-----

for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens
with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than
any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to
the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to
secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will
confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), in each case
so long as:

(A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such
Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement
of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any
Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the
commencement of the bankruptcy case;

(B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or
replacement collateral pledged to any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in
connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the First
Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing
Liens) as set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the
First Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of
periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of
such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement;

_provided that the First Lien Secured Parties of each Series shall have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure_
the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such Series or
their Authorized Representative that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and _provided, further, that the First Lien_
Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First Lien Secured Party receiving
adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such First Lien Secured Parties in connection
with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

The First Lien Secured Parties will acknowledge that the First Lien Obligations of any Series may be
refinanced, increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, modified, defeased, amended, supplemented,
restructured, repaid or refunded (in whole or in part) all without affecting the priority of claims and application of
Proceeds set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the
First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.

**Optional redemption**

At any time prior to        , 2027, the Issuers may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the indenture (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of
any additional Notes) upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price of      % of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to
the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date), with the net cash proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings (1) by Holdings or (2) by any direct or indirect
parent of Holdings to the extent the net cash proceeds thereof are or have been contributed to the common equity
capital of Holdings or are or will be used to purchase Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Holdings;
_provided that:_

(1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes (calculated after giving effect to
the issuance of any additional Notes) (excluding Notes held by Holdings, any direct or indirect parent of

54


-----

Holdings and any of Holdings’ subsidiaries) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such
redemption, unless all outstanding Notes are concurrently being redeemed; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to        , 2027, the Issuers may, on one or more occasions, also redeem all or a part
of the Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid interest to (but not
including) the date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time prior to        , 2027, the Issuers may, on one or more occasions, also redeem during each
successive twelve-month period following the Issue Date up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes
(calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any additional Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of Notes redeemed _plus accrued and_
unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Except pursuant to the preceding three paragraphs, the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuers’ option
prior to        , 2027.

On or after        , 2027, the Issuers may redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below
_plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to (but not including) the applicable redemption date, if_
redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on      of the years indicated below (subject to the rights of
holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date):

**Period** **Percentage**

2027 .................................................................................................................................................. %
2028 .................................................................................................................................................. %
2029 and thereafter ........................................................................................................................... 100.000%

If an optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Notes is registered at
the close of business on such record date.

Unless the Issuers default in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes
or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

In the event that the holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes accept any tender offer in respect of the Notes (including a Change of Control Offer and an Asset Sale Offer)
and the Issuers or a third party purchases all the Notes held by such holders, the Issuers will have the right, on not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 15 days following the purchase pursuant to the
tender offer described above, to redeem all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at the
purchase price offered to all holders in such offer (excluding any early tender premium or similar premium, if any)
_plus, to the extent not included in the offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes that remain_
outstanding, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

The trustee shall have no responsibility for calculating any redemption price.

**Mandatory redemption**

The Issuers are not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes or make an offer to purchase the Notes.

55


-----

Under certain circumstances, the Issuers may be required to offer to purchase Notes as described under the
captions “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and “—Asset Sales.” Holdings and its
Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes in the open market, by tender offer, negotiated
transactions or otherwise.

**Repurchase at the option of holders**

**_Change of control_**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless the Issuers at such time have given notice of
redemption with respect to all outstanding Notes as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” each
holder of Notes will have the right to require the Issuers to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set
forth in the indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuers will offer a change of control payment in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes repurchased _plus accrued and unpaid interest on the_
Notes repurchased to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Within 30 days following any
Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Issuers at such time have given notice of redemption with respect to
all outstanding Notes as described under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers will send, electronically
or by first class mail, a notice to each holder, with a copy to the trustee, describing the transaction or transactions
that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase Notes on the change of control
payment date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the
date such notice is sent (other than as may be required by law), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control
Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event as described below (in which case the expected
repurchase date will be stated and may be based on a date relative to the closing of the transaction that is expected to
result in the Change of Control Triggering Event and which may be tolled until the closing of such transaction), in
each case, pursuant to the procedures required by the indenture and described in such notice. The Issuers will
comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations
thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the indenture, the Issuers will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the Change of Control Triggering Event provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the change of control payment date, the Issuers will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the change of control payment in
respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the trustee the Notes properly accepted together with
an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being
purchased by the Issuers.

Notes repurchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of notes issued
but not outstanding or will be retired and canceled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party
pursuant to the preceding paragraphs will have the status of notes issued and outstanding.

The paying agent will promptly transmit to each holder of Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn the
change of control payment for such Notes, and the trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the
Notes surrendered, if any; _provided that any such new notes will be in denominations of $2,000 and integral_

56


-----

multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuers will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer
on or as soon as practicable after the change of control payment date.

The provisions described above that require the Issuers to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the indenture are
applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Notes in
the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of the Change of Control
Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made, and such Change of Control Offer is otherwise made in compliance with the provisions of this
covenant. The closing date of any such Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be changed to conform to the actual closing date of the Change of Control. Additionally, the Issuers may,
at their option, include in any Change of Control Offer an early tender payment, early consent payment or consent
payment, so long as any such payment is in addition to the purchase price set forth in the initial paragraph of this
section.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance
with the requirements set forth in the indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and
purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer or (2) notice of
redemption for all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the indenture as described above under the caption
“—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.

The Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make
it more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The
Change of Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchasers and
us. We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control Triggering Event,
although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations described below, we
could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations,
that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the indenture, but that could increase the
amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—
Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—
Liens.” Such restrictions in the indenture can be waived only with the consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the
indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of
a highly leveraged transaction.

The occurrence of a Change of Control or Change of Control Triggering Event may constitute a default
under our Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facility we may enter into from time to time. Our future
Indebtedness may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or Change of
Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control or
Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuers to
purchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due
to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuers.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuers will have available funds
sufficient to pay the Change of Control Offer purchase price for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of
the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our indebtedness and
the notes—We may be unable to finance a change of control offer.”

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Holdings and its

57


-----

Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the
ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuers to repurchase their Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer,
conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to
another Person or group may be uncertain.

The provisions in the indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the notes
as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the holders of a majority in
principal amount of the notes.

**_Asset sales_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale
unless:

(1) Holdings (or one or more of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be) receives
consideration at the time of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets or Equity
Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration received
in the Asset Sale by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, together with all other Asset Sales since the
Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), exclusive of indemnities, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or
Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as shown on Holdings’ or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most
recent balance sheet (or in the notes thereto), of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in contractual right of payment to the Notes or any
Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets and for which Holdings or
such Restricted Subsidiary shall have been validly released, or are otherwise discharged or retired
in connection with such Asset Sale;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by Holdings or any such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Holdings or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in
that conversion;

(c) any Equity Interests or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (3) or (5) of the
next paragraph of this covenant;

(d) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Sale, to the extent that Holdings or any other Restricted
Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with the
Asset Sale; and

(e) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Holdings or such
Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale; _provided that at the time of receipt of such Designated_
Non-cash Consideration, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all Designated Non-cash
Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration
being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value),
_less the amount of Net Proceeds previously realized in cash or Cash Equivalents from the sale of_
previously received Designated Non-cash Consideration is less than the greater of
(x) $100.0 million and (y) 10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period
(with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured
at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value);

58


-----

_provided that with respect to any Asset Sale, the determination of compliance with clauses (1) and (2) above may be_
made, at the Issuer’s option, on either (x) the date on which such Asset Sale is completed or (y) the date on which a
definitive agreement for such Asset Sale is entered into; provided, further, in the case of subclause (y), the definitive
agreement shall not be subsequently amended by Holdings or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary in a manner that
could cause the Asset Sale to not be in compliance with clauses (1) and (2) as of the date of such amendment.

Within eighteen (18) months after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Holdings (or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds:

(1) (a) to repay Indebtedness and other Obligations of the Issuers or any Guarantor under any
Senior Credit Facility and to correspondingly reduce commitments (if any) with respect thereto, (b) to
repay Obligations under the Notes or (c) to redeem or repurchase First Lien Obligations (other than the
Senior Credit Facility or the Notes) permitted to be incurred by the Issuers or any Guarantor under the
terms of the indenture and to correspondingly reduce commitments (if any) with respect thereto; provided
that if the Issuers or any Guarantor shall so repay other First Lien Obligations pursuant to clause (c), the
Issuers shall have also used (or made an offer, in the case of clause (iii) below, with) a portion of such Net
Proceeds pro rata in proportion to the amount thereof used to so repay other First Lien Obligations (based
on the respective principal amounts of the Notes and such other First Lien Obligations prior to such
repayment) (the “Pro Rata Amount”) to (i) redeem the Pro Rata Amount of Notes as provided under “—
Optional Redemption,” (ii) purchase the Pro Rata Amount of Notes that may be repurchased through
open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof)
or (iii) make an offer to purchase the Pro Rata Amount of Notes pursuant to an offer made to all holders in
accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer at 100% of the principal amount
thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise
be prepaid;

(2) to the extent the Net Proceeds are attributable to an Asset Sale of assets, rights or Equity
Interests that do not constitute Collateral, to repay Indebtedness secured by such assets, rights or Equity
Interests or to repay any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor and to
correspondingly reduce commitments (if any) with respect thereto;

(3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Equity Interests of, another
Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Equity Interests, the Permitted
Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings or to increase the percentage ownership by
Holdings (or a Restricted Subsidiary) in a Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make a capital expenditure or other investment in the business of Holdings and its
Restricted Subsidiaries (including in other acquisitions permitted under the indenture and in working
capital or trading activities);

(5) to use such proceeds to comply with applicable capital requirements or finance the
working capital needs of a Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, an operating regulated entity or a licensed mortgage
Restricted Subsidiary or an Equivalent Regulated Subsidiary (or to make Permitted Investments or
Restricted Investments permitted to be made under the covenant described below under the caption “—
Restricted Payments” which will be so used by a Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, an operating regulated entity or
a licensed mortgage Restricted Subsidiary or an Equivalent Regulated Subsidiary);

(6) to repay Trading Debt and to correspondingly reduce commitments (if any) with respect
thereto; or

(7) a combination of the foregoing clauses (1) through (6),

_provided, however, that, in the case of clauses (3) and (4) above, a commitment to make such acquisition, make a_
capital expenditure or other investment made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement that is executed during such
eighteen (18) month period shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds so long as such

59


-----

acquisition or expenditure is consummated within six (6) months of the end of such eighteen (18) month period (an
“Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event such Net Proceeds are not so invested by the end of such additional six
month period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, Holdings may temporarily reduce revolving credit
borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales (other than Excluded Net Proceeds) that are not applied or invested as
provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” Within fifteen days after the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $100.0 million and (y) 10% of Consolidated
EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period, the Issuers will make an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of Notes
and, to the extent the Issuers are required by the terms thereof, all holders of other First Lien Obligations containing
provisions similar to those set forth in the indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with proceeds of
sales of assets, pro rata in proportion to the respective principal amounts of the Notes and such other First Lien
Obligations required to be purchased or redeemed, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and
purchase or redeem such other First Lien Obligations that may be purchased or redeemed with the Asset Sale
Percentage of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes or such other First Lien Obligations, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the
date of purchase (subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date), and will be payable in cash. If (x) any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation
of an Asset Sale Offer or (y) the Issuers were not required to make an Asset Sale Offer with any Excess Proceeds as
a result of the Asset Sale Percentage being less than 100%, the Issuers may use those Excess Proceeds for any
purpose not otherwise prohibited by the indenture (such amounts, “Asset Sale Retained Proceeds”). If the aggregate
principal amount of Notes tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the trustee or
DTC will select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis, and in any event, in accordance with applicable
procedures of DTC. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

To the extent that the Issuers have reasonably determined that repatriation of (i) any or all of the Net
Proceeds of any Asset Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary is prohibited, restricted or delayed by applicable local law or
(ii) any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Assets Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary could result in a material adverse tax
consequence, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not constitute Net Proceeds or be required to be
applied in compliance with this provisions under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales;”
_provided that, in any event, the Issuers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take actions within their_
reasonable control that are reasonably required to eliminate such tax effects.

The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale
provisions of the indenture by virtue of such compliance.

If an Asset Sale Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuers will have available funds
sufficient to pay the Asset Sale Offer purchase price for all the Notes that might be delivered by holders of the Notes
seeking to accept the Asset Sale Offer. It is also possible that the events that constitute an Asset Sale may also be
events of default under a Senior Credit Facility. These events may permit the lender(s) under such Senior Credit
Facility to accelerate the Indebtedness outstanding thereunder. If the Issuers are required to repurchase the Notes
pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer and repay certain amounts outstanding under a Senior Credit Facility if such
Indebtedness is accelerated, the Issuers would probably require third-party financing. The Issuers cannot be sure that
they would be able to obtain third-party financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Indebtedness under the
applicable Senior Credit Facility is not paid, the lender(s) thereunder may seek to enforce security interests in the
collateral securing such indebtedness, thereby limiting the Issuers’ ability to raise cash to purchase the Notes, and
reducing the practical benefit of the offer to purchase provisions to the holders of the Notes.

-----

**Selection and notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the trustee (or DTC) will select Notes for
redemption on a pro rata basis, by lot or other method subject to the rules and procedures of DTC, unless otherwise
required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements.

No Notes of $2,000 or less can be redeemed in part. Notices of redemption will be delivered by electronic
transmission (for Notes held in global form) or first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the
redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may
be delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the indenture.

Notice of any redemption upon any corporate transaction or other event (including any Equity Offering,
incurrence of Indebtedness, Change of Control or other transaction) may be given prior to the completion thereof. In
addition, any redemption described above or notice thereof may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more
conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a corporate transaction or other event. If any
redemption is so subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the notice thereof shall describe
each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the redemption date may be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion),
and/or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date as so delayed, and/or that such notice may be rescinded at any time by the Issuers if the Issuers
determine in their sole discretion that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied (or waived). For the
avoidance of doubt, if any redemption date shall be delayed as contemplated by this paragraph and the terms of the
applicable notice of redemption, such redemption date as so delayed may occur at any time after the original
redemption date set forth in the applicable notice of redemption and after the satisfaction (or waiver) of any
applicable conditions precedent, including, without limitation, on a date that is less than 10 days after the original
redemption date or more than 60 days after the date of the applicable notice of redemption. In addition, the Issuers
may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with
respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the
original Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the
redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of Notes called for redemption.

**Certain covenants**

**_Changes in covenants when the notes are rated investment grade_**

If on any date following the date of the indenture, (1) the Notes are assigned an Investment Grade Rating
from at least two Rating Agencies and (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following provisions of the indenture (the
“Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(4) “—Certain Covenants—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Subsidiaries”;

61


-----

(5) “—Certain Covenants—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”;

(7) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption “—
Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”; and

(8) “—Certain Covenants—Additional note guarantees.”

In the event that Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under
the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reinstatement
Date”)any of the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the
Notes below an Investment Grade Rating following which the Notes do not have an Investment Grade Rating from
at least two Rating Agencies, then the Suspended Covenants will be reinstated and Holdings and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will be subject to the Suspended Covenants on and after such date. The period of time between the date
of suspension of such covenants and the Reinstatement Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such reinstatement, no action taken or omitted to be taken by
Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries prior to such reinstatement that would have violated the Suspended
Covenants shall result in a Default or Event of Default. After any such reinstatement, (1) with respect to Restricted
Payments made after such Reinstatement Date, the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments will be
calculated as though the covenant described under the caption “—Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the
date of the indenture and, prior to, but not during the Suspension Period, and, accordingly, Restricted Payments
made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under
the first paragraph of “—Restricted Payments,” (2) any Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been incurred or issued pursuant to clause (8)
of the second paragraph set forth under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,”
(3) any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the applicable Reinstatement Date pursuant to an agreement entered
into during such Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (9) of the second paragraph
under the caption “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (4) for purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend
and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period
prior to the Reinstatement Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to
have been entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Subsidiaries,” and (5) for purposes of the covenant described under “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reinstatement Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to
zero.

The Issuers will provide the trustee with written notice of the commencement of any Suspension Period or
Reinstatement Date. Until the trustee receives such notice, it shall be entitled to assume no such Suspension Period
or Reinstatement Date, as applicable, has occurred and will have no obligation to notify any holder thereof until it
has received such notice. In no event shall the trustee be responsible for monitoring the ratings of the Notes.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.

**_Restricted payments_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of
Holdings’ or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment
in connection with any merger or consolidation involving Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or
to the direct or indirect holders of Holdings’ or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their
capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified
Stock) of Holdings and other than dividends or distributions payable to Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary
of Holdings);

62


-----

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation,
in connection with any merger or consolidation involving Holdings) any Equity Interests of Holdings or any
direct or indirect parent of Holdings;

(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise
acquire or retire for value any Material Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Guarantor that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or to any Note Guarantee (excluding any intercompany
Indebtedness between or among Holdings and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), except (a) payments of
interest or principal at the Stated Maturity or (b) the purchase, repurchase, defeasance, redemption or other
acquisition or retirement of any such Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal installment or payment at the Stated Maturity thereof, in each case due within one year
of the date of purchase, repurchase, defeasance, redemption or other acquisition or retirement; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”),

unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(1) to the extent utilizing amounts under clause (a) of the definition of the Cumulative Credit,
no Event of Default under clauses (1), (2) or (10) of the definition thereof has occurred and is continuing or
would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment; provided that the provisions of this clause (1)
shall only apply to clauses (1) and (2) of the definition of a Restricted Payment; and

(2) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries since the January 13, 2022 (excluding
Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2) through (10) and (12) through (17) of the next succeeding
paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of the Cumulative Credit.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit (each, a “Permitted Payment”):

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any redemption
within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or giving of the redemption notice, as the case
may be, if at the date of declaration or notice, the dividend or distribution or redemption payment would
have complied with the provisions of the indenture;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of the net cash proceeds of
the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of Holdings) of, Equity Interests of Holdings
(or a parent company thereof) (other than Disqualified Stock) or from the substantially concurrent
contribution of common equity capital to Holdings; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds
that are utilized for any such Restricted Payment will be excluded from clause (3)(b) of the preceding
paragraph;

(3) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of
Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes or to any Note Guarantee with the net cash proceeds from a substantially concurrent incurrence of
Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness;

(4) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or limited liability
company, any similar distribution) by a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings to the holders of its Equity
Interests on a pro rata basis;

(5) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any Equity
Interests of Holdings; provided that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased, redeemed, acquired

63


-----

or retired Equity Interests may not exceed the greater of (x) $30.0 million and (y) 3.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period in any fiscal year of Holdings with unused amounts in
any fiscal year permitted to be carried over to the succeeding fiscal years; _provided,_ _however, that such_
amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed:

(a) the cash proceeds received by Holdings or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
from the sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Holdings or any direct or
indirect parent of Holdings (to the extent contributed to Holdings) to employees, directors,
officers, franchisees or consultants of Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries or any direct or
indirect parent of Holdings that occurs after the Issue Date (provided that the amount of such cash
proceeds utilized for any such repurchase, retirement, other acquisition or dividend will not
increase the amount available for Restricted Payments under the definition of Cumulative Credit
contained in “—Restricted Payments”), plus

(b) the cash proceeds of key man life insurance policies received by Holdings or
any direct or indirect parent of Holdings (to the extent contributed to Holdings) or the Restricted
Subsidiaries after the Issue Date;

_provided that Holdings may elect to apply all or any portion of the aggregate increase contemplated by_
clauses (a) and (b) above in any calendar year; and _provided,_ _further, that cancellation of Indebtedness_
owing to Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary from any present or former employees, directors, officers,
franchisees or consultants of Holdings, any Restricted Subsidiary or the direct or indirect parents of the
Holdings in connection with a repurchase of Equity Interests of Holdings or any of its direct or indirect
parents will not be deemed to constitute a Restricted Payment for purposes of this covenant or any other
provision of the indenture;

(6) the repurchase of Equity Interests (or Restricted Payments by Holdings to allow
repurchases of Equity Interests of any direct or indirect parent of Holdings) (i) deemed to occur upon the
exercise of stock options or restricted stock units to the extent such Equity Interests of Holdings or any
direct or indirect parent of Holdings represent a portion of the exercise price of those stock options or
restricted stock units; and (ii) in connection with the withholding of a portion of the Equity Interests,
options and other equity awards of Holdings or any direct or indirect parent of Holdings granted or awarded
to an officer, director consultant, employee or manager to pay any withholding and similar taxes payable by
such officer, director, consultant or employee or manager upon such grant, award or vesting thereof (and
any Restricted Payment to any direct or indirect parent of Holdings to pay any withholding taxes in respect
thereof);

(7) the declaration and payment of regularly scheduled or accrued dividends to holders of
any class or series of Disqualified Stock of Holdings or preferred stock (or preferred interests, in the case of

under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;

(8) cash payment in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in connection with the exercise of
warrants, options or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for the Equity Interests of Holdings
(or Restricted Payments by Holdings to allow payment in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in connection
with the exercise of warrants, options or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for the Equity
Interests of any direct or indirect parent of Holdings); provided, however, that any such cash payment shall
not be for the purpose of evading the limitation of the covenant described under this caption;

(9) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any
Indebtedness of an Issuer or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes or to any Note Guarantee or any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock required pursuant to the
provisions similar to those described under the sections entitled “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—
Change of Control” and “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”; _provided that there is a_
concurrent or prior Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable, and all Notes tendered by

holders of the Notes in connection with such Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, as applicable,
have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired or retired for value;

not to exceed the greater of (x) $180.0 million and (y) 30% of Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable
Measurement Period;

(11) the payment of a quarterly distribution or dividend in an amount not to exceed the
Specified Dividend Amount during any fiscal quarter; provided that any such amount not distributed within
a fiscal quarter shall not be carried forward to the next fiscal quarter;

Measurement Period immediately preceding the date of such Restricted Payment, determined on a pro
forma basis, does not exceed, 2.00 to 1.00;

(13) so long as Holdings and VFH are each treated as a pass-through or disregarded entity (a
“Flow-Through Entity”) for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, Permitted Tax Distributions by
VFH to Holdings and by Holdings to its members at such times and with respect to such periods as Tax
Distributions (as defined in the Holdings LLC Agreement) are required to be made or designated pursuant
to the Holdings LLC Agreement; provided that if Holdings is not a Flow-Through Entity, so long as VFH is
a Flow-Through Entity, VFH may make Permitted Tax Distributions to Holdings on a quarterly basis and at
the end of a Taxable Year (with the determination of the Permitted Tax Distributions to be made by
substituting VFH for Holdings in the applicable definitions); _provided further that Restricted Payments_
under this clause (13) in respect of any taxes attributable to the income of any Unrestricted Subsidiaries of
Holdings may be made only to the extent that such Unrestricted Subsidiaries have made cash payments for
such purpose to VFH or Holdings or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(14) dividends, loans, advances, repayments or distributions to any direct or indirect parent
company of Holdings, or other payments by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, in amounts required for
such parent company to:

Permitted Securitization Financing or a receivables financing may be made.;

(16) payments or distributions to dissenting stockholders or stockholders exercising appraisal
rights pursuant to applicable law or as a result of the settlement of any stockholder claims or action
(whether actual, contingent or potential), pursuant to or in connection with a consolidation, amalgamation,
merger or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, that complies with the covenant described under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;
_provided that as a result of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer of assets, Holdings shall_
have made a Change of Control Offer (if required by the indenture) and that all notes tendered by holders in
connection with such Change of Control Offer have been repurchased, redeemed or acquired for value;

(17) the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement for value of any
Indebtedness of an Issuer or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
Notes or to any Note Guarantee in an amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 25% of
Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period;

(18) Restricted Payments that are made with (or in an aggregate amount that does not exceed
the aggregate amount of) Excluded Contributions; and

(19) any Restricted Payment made in connection with a Permitted Tax Restructuring.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by Holdings or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) in the event that a proposed Restricted
Payment (or portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or more categories (or subparts thereof) of Permitted
Payments or Permitted Investments, or is entitled to be made or incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, Holdings will be entitled to divide, classify or re-classify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such
payment (or portion thereof) based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification in any manner that
complies with this covenant, and such payment (or portion thereof) will be treated as having been made pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant or such clause or clauses (or subparts thereof) in the definition of Permitted
Payments or Permitted Investments and (2) the amount of any return of or on capital from any Investment shall be
netted against the amount of such Investment for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant.

**_Incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of preferred stock_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with
respect to (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and Holdings will not issue any
Disqualified Stock and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock;
_provided,_ _however, that Holdings may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock,_
and the Issuers and the Guarantors may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), if (x) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for Holdings’ Applicable Measurement Period immediately preceding the date on which such

66

additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least
2.00 to 1.00, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom) or
(y) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of Holdings for the Applicable Measurement Period immediately
preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock is issued, as the
case may be, is not greater than 3.00 to 1.00, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of
the net proceeds therefrom), in each case, as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified
Stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of
Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by the Issuers and any Guarantors of Indebtedness and letters of credit
under Senior Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this
clause (1) (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the maximum potential
liability of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder) not to exceed the sum of
(a) $1,977.0 million plus (b) the greater of (x) $1,000.0 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA for the
Applicable Measurement Period plus (c) an additional aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (i) that
is secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Liens securing the Notes that at the time of
incurrence does not cause the Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Ratio for the Applicable Measurement
Period immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such
Disqualified Stock is issued, as the case may be, to exceed 2.50 to 1.00 or, in the case of Indebtedness
incurred in connection with an acquisition, Investment, New Project or refinancing transaction not
prohibited under the Indenture, the Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Ratio of Holdings to exceed the
greater of (x) immediately prior to such incurrence and (y) 2.50 to 1.00, (ii) that is secured by the Collateral
on a junior lien basis to the Liens securing the Notes that at the time of incurrence does not cause the
Consolidated Secured Indebtedness Ratio for the Applicable Measurement Period immediately preceding
the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock is issued, as the case
may be, to exceed 3.00 to 1.00 or, in the case of Indebtedness incurred in connection with an acquisition,
Investment, New Project or refinancing transaction not prohibited under the Indenture, the Consolidated
Secured Indebtedness Ratio of Holdings to exceed the greater of (x) immediately prior to such incurrence
and (y) 3.00 to 1.00 or (iii) that is other Indebtedness not covered by clauses (i) or (ii), that at the time of
incurrence either (A) does not cause the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio for the Applicable
Measurement Period immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or
such Disqualified Stock is issued, as the case may be, to exceed 3.00 to 1.00 or, in the case of Indebtedness
incurred in connection with an acquisition, Investment, New Project or refinancing transaction not
prohibited under the Indenture, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of Holdings to exceed the greater of
(x) immediately prior to such incurrence and (y) 3.00 to 1.00 or (B) does not cause the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Applicable Measurement Period immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock is issued, as the case may be, to be less than
2.00 to 1.00 or, in the case of Indebtedness incurred in connection with an acquisition, Investment, New
Project or refinancing transaction not prohibited under the Indenture, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of
Holdings to be less than the lesser of (x) immediately prior to such incurrence and (y) 2.00 to 1.00;

(2) the incurrence by the Issuers and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the
Notes to be issued on the Issue Date and the related Note Guarantees;

(3) Indebtedness of Holdings to any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings or of any Restricted
Subsidiary of Holdings to Holdings or any other Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings to the extent that such
Indebtedness corresponds to any Investment permitted by clause (5) of the definition of “Permitted
Investments”; provided that such Indebtedness shall not have been transferred or pledged to any third party;

(4) the incurrence by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany
Indebtedness between or among Holdings and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:

(a) if an Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee
is not an Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness (except in respect of intercompany current

67


-----

liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business in connection with the cash management, tax
and accounting operations of Holdings and its Subsidiaries) must be expressly subordinated to the
prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations then due with respect to the Notes, in the case of an
Issuer, or the Note Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor (in each case, only to the extent permitted
by applicable law and not giving rise to material adverse tax consequences); and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any
such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of
Holdings and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either
Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings, will be deemed, in each case (except any pledge
of such Indebtedness constituting a Permitted Lien but not the transfer thereof upon foreclosure),
to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (4);

(5) the issuance by any of Holdings’ Restricted Subsidiaries to Holdings or to any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries of shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that:

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such
preferred stock being held by a Person other than Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings;
and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such preferred stock to a Person that is not
either Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings,

will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an issuance of such preferred stock by such Restricted
Subsidiary that was not permitted by this clause (5);

(6) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock of (A) Holdings or any Restricted
Subsidiary incurred to finance an acquisition or other Investment or New Project or (B) Persons that are

giving effect to such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, other Investment or New Project on
a pro forma basis, either:

(a) Holdings would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the provisions set forth in the first sentence of this covenant; or

(b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of Holdings would be no less than
immediately prior to such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, other Investment or
New Project or (y) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of Holdings would be no greater than
immediately prior to such acquisition, merger, consolidation, amalgamation, other Investment or
New Project;

(7) Guarantees incurred in the ordinary course of business by Holdings or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of (i) obligations of any Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries and any other
Excluded Regulated Subsidiaries or (ii) other obligations of any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings that is
not a Broker-Dealer Subsidiary, an Issuer, a Guarantor, or other Excluded Regulated Subsidiary;

or secured by a Lien on any such assets prior to the acquisition thereof; provided that such Indebtedness is

initially incurred prior to or within 365 days after such acquisition or the completion of such construction,
repair, replacement or improvement;

(10) Trading Debt;

(11) Guarantees of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of Indebtedness or other
liabilities of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries so long as the incurrence or existence of such
Indebtedness or other liabilities is not prohibited under the indenture; provided that an Issuer or any of the
Guarantors may not incur such Guarantees in respect of Indebtedness or other liabilities (other than
unsecured Trading Debt (and any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness thereof)) of a party that is not an
Issuer or a Guarantor unless such Guarantee is a Permitted Investment or a Permitted Payment; provided,
_further, that any Guarantees in respect of subordinated Indebtedness shall also be subordinated in right of_
payment to the Notes or any Note Guarantee on terms at least as favorable to the holders of the Notes as

for purposes of determining the amount of Indebtedness that may at any time be incurred under this
clause (26); and

(30) Indebtedness of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries arising pursuant to any
Permitted Tax Restructuring.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred
Stock” covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the
categories of Permitted Debt described above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant, Holdings will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later
divide or reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant and
without giving pro forma effect thereto; _provided that amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement on_
the Issue Date shall be incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt and shall not be
reclassified. The accrual of interest or premium, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment
of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of
preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on
Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be
an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that Holdings or any Restricted
Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations
in exchange rates or currency values.

In connection with (x) the incurrence or issuance, as applicable, of revolving loan Indebtedness under this
covenant or (y) any commitment to incur or issue Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under this
covenant and the granting of any Lien to secure such Indebtedness, the Issuers may designate such incurrence or
issuance and the granting of any Lien therefor as having occurred on the date of first incurrence of such revolving
loan Indebtedness or commitment (such date, the “Deemed Date”), and any related subsequent actual incurrence or
issuance or granting of such Lien will be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to have been incurred or
issued or granted on such Deemed Date, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable), the Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Ratio, the
Consolidated Secured Indebtedness Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and Consolidated EBITDA (and
all such calculations on and after the Deemed Date until the termination of such commitment shall be made on a pro
forma basis giving effect to the deemed incurrence or issuance, the granting of any Lien therefor and related
transactions in connection therewith).

Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise
included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of
such amount of Indebtedness; _provided that the incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or_
letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in
the case of term debt, or first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar equivalent), in the
case of revolving credit debt. However, if the Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated
in a foreign currency, and the refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of the refinancing, the U.S.

71


-----

dollar-denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of the
refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced. The principal
amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in
which the respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of the refinancing. Provisions similar
to those in this paragraph shall apply in determining compliance with the covenant set forth under the caption “—
Liens.”

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1) the accreted value of Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original
issue discount;

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the
specified Person, the lesser of:

(a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

**_Liens_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness on any asset now owned or hereafter
acquired, except Permitted Liens.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness
(or any portion thereof) need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens (or any portion
thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” but may be permitted in part under any combination thereof
and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of one or
more of the categories of permitted Liens (or any portion thereof) described in the definition of “Permitted Liens,”
the Issuers may, in their sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify (as if incurred at
such later time), such Lien securing such item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies
with this covenant and without giving pro forma effect thereto; provided that Liens securing amounts outstanding
under the Senior Credit Agreement on the Issue Date or securing Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the
commitments in effect under the Senior Credit Agreement on the Issue Date shall be incurred pursuant to
clause (1)(x) of the definition of Permitted Liens and shall not be reclassified. In addition, with respect to any
revolving loan Indebtedness or commitment relating to the incurrence of Indebtedness that is designated to be
incurred on a Deemed Date pursuant to the fifth paragraph of the covenant described under “—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock,” any Lien that does or that shall secure such Indebtedness may also
be designated by the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to be incurred on such Deemed Date and, in such event,
any related subsequent actual incurrence of such Lien shall be deemed for all purposes under the indenture to be
incurred on such Deemed Date, including for purposes of calculating usage of any “Permitted Lien,” the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, usage of any baskets hereunder (if applicable), the Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness
Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Indebtedness Ratio, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio and Consolidated
EBITDA (and all such calculations on and after the Deemed Date until the termination or funding of such
commitment shall be made on a pro forma basis giving effect to the deemed incurrence or issuance, the granting of
any Lien therefor and related transactions and pro forma events in connection therewith).

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original

72


-----

issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of
original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted
Subsidiary to:

Subsidiaries;

(2) make loans or advances to Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of
any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired;

(8) any agreement for the sale or other disposition of assets not prohibited under the
indenture that relate solely to the assets subject such to such sale or other disposition pending such sale or
other disposition;

dividends;

(16) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(18) restrictions in agreements or instruments relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be

Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock” (A) if the encumbrances
and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in instruments
governing Indebtedness as in effect on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by Holdings), or (B) if
such encumbrance or restriction is not materially more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than is
customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by Holdings) and Holdings determines in
good faith that such encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Issuers’ ability to make
principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(19) agreements governing Hedging Obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business;

and other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice

Holdings or the Issuers;

to in clauses (1) through (24) above; _provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements,_
renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment
of Holdings, not materially more restrictive with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions
than those contained in the dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification,
restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

Nothing contained in this covenant shall prevent Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from
(a) restricting the sale or other disposition of property or assets of Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that
secure Indebtedness of the Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries permitted by the indenture or (b) creating,
incurring, assuming or suffering to exist any Liens otherwise permitted by the indenture. For purposes of
determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any preferred stock in receiving dividends or
liquidating distributions prior to distributions being paid on Equity Interests shall not be deemed a restriction on the
ability to make distributions on Equity Interests, and (2) the subordination of loans or advances made to a Restricted
Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary, or other subordination provisions in any
Indebtedness, shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Merger, consolidation or sale of assets_**

Neither Holdings nor any Issuer will, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another
Person (whether or not Holdings or such Issuer is the surviving Person) or (2) sell, assign, transfer, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(1) either:

(a) Holdings or such Issuer is the surviving Person; or

(b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other
than Holdings or such Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition has been made is a Person organized or existing under the laws of the United States,
any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than
Holdings or such Issuer) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other
disposition has been made assumes all the obligations of the Issuers under the Notes, the indenture and the
Collateral Documents pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the trustee;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Event of Default exists;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing
transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period,

(a) Holdings or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger
(if other than Holdings or such Issuer), or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition has been made would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant the provisions set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described
above under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”; or

75


-----

(b) either (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Holdings or the Person formed
by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Holdings or such Issuer), or to
which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made would be
greater than or equal to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of Holdings immediately prior to such
transaction or (y) the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio for Holdings or the Person formed by or
surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than Holdings or such Issuer), or to which
such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition has been made would be equal to
or less than the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of Holdings immediately prior to such
transaction; and

(5) the Issuers shall have delivered to the trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer and such supplemental
indentures, if any, comply with the indenture.

Clauses (3) and (4) of the prior paragraph will not apply to:

(1) a merger of Holdings or one of the Issuers with an Affiliate solely for the purpose of
reincorporating Holdings or one of the Issuers in another jurisdiction; or

(2) any consolidation or merger, or any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other
disposition of assets between or among the Issuers and one or more of the Guarantors.

The successor Person (if not Holdings or such Issuer) will be the successor in interest to Holdings or the
applicable Issuer and shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, Holdings
or the applicable Issuer under the indenture, and the predecessor shall be released from the obligation to pay the
principal of, and interest on, the Notes.

**_Transactions with affiliates_**

Holdings will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell,
lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or
enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or
for the benefit of, any Affiliate of Holdings (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or
consideration in cash in excess of the greater of (x) $25.0 million and (y) 2.5% of Consolidated EBITDA for the
Applicable Measurement Period, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to Holdings or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by
Holdings or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
involving aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $100.0 million and (y) 10.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period, the Issuers deliver to the trustee a
resolution of the Board of Directors of Holdings set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
Affiliate Transaction complies with this covenant and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by
a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Holdings; provided, however, that in
the event there are no disinterested members of the Board of Directors of Holdings, the Board of Directors
of Holdings shall also have received a written opinion from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking
firm of national standing to the effect that such Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate
Transactions is fair, from a financial standpoint, to Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries or is not less
favorable to Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries than could reasonably be expected to be obtained at
the time in an arm’s-length transaction with a non-Affiliate.

76

the provisions of the prior paragraph:

Interest in, or controls, such Person;

(9) transactions pursuant to agreements or arrangements in effect on the Issue Date or any
amendment thereto or renewal thereof (so long as any such amendment or renewal is not disadvantageous

agreement as in effect on the Issue Date);

(10) transactions between or among Holdings and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(11) advances to or reimbursements of expenses incurred by directors, officers and employees

(12) transactions between Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any other Person,
a director of which is also on the Board of Directors of Holdings or any direct or indirect parent company
of Holdings, and such common director is the sole cause for such other Person to be deemed an Affiliate of

a member of the Board of Directors of Holdings or any direct or indirect parent company of Holdings, as
the case may be, on any transaction with such other Person;

(13) any transaction in which Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may

point of view or that such transaction meets the requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

77


-----

and its Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing any covenant set forth in the indenture; and

(25) Permitted Tax Restructurings.

**_Additional note guarantees_**

If (a) Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries acquires or creates another Restricted Subsidiary after
the Issue Date and such Restricted Subsidiary enters into a Guarantee with respect to any Indebtedness under a
Senior Credit Facility, Junior Lien Obligations or unsecured Indebtedness with an outstanding principal amount in
excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period
of an Issuer or any Guarantor or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary that does not guarantee the Obligations under the
Senior Credit Facilities as of the Issue Date later enters into a Guarantee with respect to any Indebtedness under a
Senior Credit Facility, Junior Lien Obligations or unsecured Indebtedness of an Issuer or any Guarantor with an
outstanding principal amount in excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA for the

78


-----

Applicable Measurement Period, then that Restricted Subsidiary will within 30 days of the date on which it issues or
incurs such Indebtedness or enters into such Guarantee, (i) execute and deliver to the trustee a supplemental
indenture substantially in the form attached to the indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
Guarantee the Notes, (ii) execute and deliver to the collateral agent joinder agreements or other similar agreements
with respect to the Collateral Documents and (iii) take all actions required thereunder to perfect the Liens created
thereunder. In connection with any supplemental indenture delivered pursuant to clause (i) above, Holdings shall
deliver to the trustee an Opinion of Counsel that such supplemental indenture has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by Holdings and constitutes legally valid and binding and enforceable obligations of Holdings (subject
to customary qualifications and exceptions).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no Restricted Subsidiary that constitutes a Foreign Subsidiary, an
Excluded Subsidiary, an Immaterial Subsidiary, an Excluded Regulated Subsidiary or an Excluded Domestic
Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor unless it enters into a Guarantee with respect to any
Indebtedness under a Senior Credit Facility, Junior Lien Obligations or unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuers or any
Guarantor with an outstanding principal amount in excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 10% of Consolidated
EBITDA for the Applicable Measurement Period and (y) all Subsidiaries that have properly been designated as
Unrestricted Subsidiaries under the indenture shall not be required to be Guarantors for so long as they continue to
constitute Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

Each additional Note Guarantee will be contractually limited as necessary to limit certain defenses
generally available to guarantors or sureties (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) and comply with other legal restrictions applicable to the
Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holdings shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be
expected to give rise to or result in (x) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary or (y) any violation of applicable law that cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures
reasonably available to Holdings or the Restricted Subsidiary.

**_Designation of restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of Holdings may designate any Restricted Subsidiary other than either Issuer to be
an Unrestricted Subsidiary if no Event of Default would be in existence following such designation. If a Restricted
Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, (1) the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding
Investments owned by Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as Unrestricted will be
deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for
Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” or under one or
more clauses of the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by Holdings and (2) any guarantee by
Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness of the Subsidiary being so designated shall be
deemed an incurrence of such Indebtedness. That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be
permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

Any designation of a Subsidiary of Holdings as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the trustee
by filing with the trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of Holdings giving effect to such
designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied with the preceding conditions and
was permitted by the covenant described above under the caption “—Restricted Payments.”

The Board of Directors of Holdings may at any time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a
Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings; _provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of_
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant
described under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”; and (2) no Event of
Default would be in existence following such designation.

79


-----

**_Reports_**

The indenture will provide that, so long as any notes are outstanding, Holdings will deliver to the trustee a

non-accelerated filers (or such later time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for nonaccelerated filers, including any extension as would be permitted by Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act
or any special order of the SEC), annual reports of Holdings for such fiscal year containing the information
that would have been required to be contained in an annual report on Form 10-K (or any successor or
comparable form) if the Holdings had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, except to the
extent permitted to be excluded by the SEC;

(2) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for
non-accelerated filers (or such later time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for nonaccelerated filers, including any extension as would be permitted by Rule 12b-25 under the Exchange Act
or any special order of the SEC), quarterly reports of Holdings for such fiscal quarter containing the
information that would have been required to be contained in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q (or any
successor or comparable form) if Holdings had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act, except
to the extent permitted to be excluded by the SEC; and

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations for filing
current reports on Form 8-K, current reports of Holdings containing substantially all of the information that
would be required to be filed in a current report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act on the Issue Date
pursuant to Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01, 5.02(a), (b) and (c) of
Form 8-K if Holdings had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that no
such current reports will be required to be delivered if Holdings determines in its good faith judgment that
such event is not material to holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of
Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) such reports shall not be required to comply with Section 302,
Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or related Items 307, 308 and 308T of

the SEC or similar rules and regulations of any other government agency, (d) such reports shall not be required to
include financial statements in interactive data format using the eXtensible Business Reporting Language and such
reports shall be subject to exceptions, exclusions and other differences consistent with the presentation of financial
and other information in this offering memorandum and shall not be required to present compensation or beneficial
ownership information.

With respect to any period that there shall be one or more Unrestricted Subsidiaries that, in the aggregate,
hold more than 5.0% of Consolidated Total Assets as of the end of such period, the quarterly and annual financial
information required by the preceding paragraphs shall either (x) include a reasonably detailed presentation, either
on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto of the financial condition and results of operations
of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries or (y) be accompanied by unaudited financial statements or unaudited financial
information necessary to eliminate the accounts of Unrestricted Subsidiaries (if any) from the consolidated financial
statements of Holdings and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

In addition, Holdings will, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to hold and participate in quarterly conference calls with the holders of the Notes, beneficial owners of the
Notes, bona fide prospective investors, securities analysts and market makers to discuss such financial information
no later than 10 business days after distribution of such financial information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the

80


-----

first paragraph under “—Reports.” If Holdings or a direct or indirect parent of Holdings holds a publicly accessible
quarterly conference call with its investors, it shall be deemed to satisfy the obligation of the foregoing sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Holdings or a direct or indirect parent of Holdings files with or furnishes
to the SEC (a) an Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to a fiscal year that complies in all material respects
with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding such filing, then such filing shall be deemed to satisfy the
requirements of clause (1) of the first paragraph under this caption with respect to the relevant fiscal year; (b) a
quarterly report on Form 10-Q with respect to a fiscal quarter that complies in all material respects with the rules
and regulations of the SEC regarding such filing, then such filing shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
clause (2) of the first paragraph under this caption with respect to the relevant fiscal quarter; and (c) a current report
on Form 8-K with respect to any of the events described in clause (3) of the first paragraph under this caption that
complies in all material respects with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding such filing, then such filing
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of clause (3) of the first paragraph under this caption with respect to
such event; provided, that in each case of clause (a) and (b), that such filings include such disclosure as is reasonably
necessary to describe any material differences between the consolidated financial information of such direct or
indirect parent and the consolidated financial information of Holdings, and to the extent applicable, the information
required by the third paragraph under “—Reports.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holdings will be deemed to have delivered such reports and information
referred to above to the holders, prospective investors, market makers, securities analysts and the trustee for all
purposes of the indenture if Holdings or a direct or indirect parent of Holdings has filed such reports with the SEC
via the EDGAR filing system (or any successor system) and such reports are publicly available. In addition, the
requirements of this covenant will be deemed satisfied and Holdings will be deemed to have delivered such reports
and information referred to above to the trustee for all purposes of the indenture by the posting of reports and
information that would be required to be provided on the Holding’s website (or that of any of the direct or indirect
parent of Holdings).

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the trustee for informational purposes only, and the
trustee’s receipt thereof shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable
from information contained therein, including the Issuers’, any Guarantor’s or any other Person’s compliance with
any of its covenants under the indenture or the Notes (as to which the trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on
Officer’s Certificates). The trustee shall not be obligated to monitor or confirm, on a continuing basis or otherwise,
the Issuers’, any Guarantor’s or any other Person’s compliance with this section or with respect to any reports or
other documents filed under the indenture. The trustee shall have no obligation whatsoever to determine whether
reports and information have been posted.

Furthermore, Holdings agrees that, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, during a period in which
Holdings or any direct or indirect parent of Holdings is not subject to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, or otherwise permitted to furnish the SEC with certain information pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange
Act, it will furnish to the holders of Notes, beneficial owners of the Notes, bona fide prospective investors, securities
analysts and market makers, upon their request, any information required to be delivered pursuant to
Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Any and all Defaults or Events of Default arising from a failure to furnish or file in a timely manner a
report or other information or conduct a conference call required by this covenant shall be deemed cured (and the
Issuers shall be deemed to be in compliance with this covenant) upon furnishing or filing such report or other
information or conducting a conference call as contemplated by this covenant (but without regard to the date on
which such report or other information is so furnished or filed); provided that such cure shall not otherwise affect the
rights of the holders under “—Events of Default” if payment of any notes has been accelerated in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture and such acceleration has not been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure.

**Events of default and remedies**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes;

81


-----

(2) (a) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the
principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes or (b) the failure to purchase Notes when required pursuant
to the provisions described under the captions “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of
Control” or “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(3) failure by Holdings or the Issuers to comply with the provisions described under the
caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(4) failure by Holdings or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after notice to the
Issuers by the trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding voting as a single class to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture Documents
(other than those described in clause (1), (2) or (3) above);

(5) any Material Indebtedness of Holdings or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (other than
any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) is not paid
within any applicable grace period after final maturity or is accelerated by the holders thereof because of a
default thereunder;

(6) failure by Holdings or any of its Significant Subsidiaries (other than any Special Purpose
Securitization Subsidiary) (or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that together would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary, other than any Special Purpose Securitization Subsidiary) to pay final judgments
entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of the greater of $75.0 million
and 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA (not covered by independent third-party insurance as to which liability
has not been denied by such insurance carrier), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a
period of 60 consecutive days;

(7) except as expressly permitted by the indenture and the Collateral Documents, any of the
Collateral Documents shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect in all material respects, or
Holdings or a Guarantor shall so assert, or any security interest created, or purported to be created, by any
of the Collateral Documents with respect to Collateral exceeding $75.0 million in Fair Market Value shall
cease to be enforceable and of the same effect and priority purported to be created thereby, in each case for
30 days after notice to the Issuers by the trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding voting as a single class, except solely as a result of the collateral
agent taking or refraining from taking any action in its sole control;

(8) the repudiation by Holdings, an Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of any of its material
obligations under the Collateral Documents and such default continues for 10 consecutive days;

(9) except as permitted by the indenture, any Note Guarantee of Holdings, any Significant
Subsidiary, or any group of Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary is
held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be in full force
and effect, or Holdings, any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors that,
taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or any Person acting on behalf of any Holdings or
such Guarantor or Guarantors, denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Note Guarantee; and

(10) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the indenture with respect to
Holdings, an Issuer or any of Holdings’ other Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any
group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to
Holdings or an Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or
notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

82


-----

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes may direct the trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other holder of a Note (it being understood that the trustee has no duty to determine whether any such action is
prejudicial to any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes) or that would involve the trustee in personal liability. The
trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines
that withholding notice is in the holders’ interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of
principal, interest or premium, if any.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the trustee to
provide a notice of Default or notice of acceleration may not be given by the trustee or holders of the Notes (or any
other action taken on the assertion of any Default) with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to
holders of the Notes, more than two years prior to such notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the
trustee to provide a notice of default or notice of acceleration (or other action).

Subject to the provisions of the indenture relating to the duties of the trustee, in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered to the trustee
indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to
receive payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy
with respect to the indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
requested in writing the trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered, and, if requested, provided, the trustee security or indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the
request and the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes have
not given the trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the
trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or
Event of Default and its consequences under the indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of interest or premium, if any, on, or the principal of, the Notes.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) above, such Event of Default and all
consequences thereof shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the trustee
or the holders of Notes, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose (x) the Indebtedness or Guarantee that is
the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the
acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (z) if the default that is the
basis for such Event of Default has been cured.

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the trustee to provide a notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders
(other than a Regulated Bank) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from
each such holder delivered to the Issuers and the trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or
its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position
Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of

83


-----

Default (a “Default Direction”) shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or
otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of
providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuers may
reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s Position Representation within
five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC or its
nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the
beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such
Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuers
determine in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuers have
initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at
such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default or Event of Default that
resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default
shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be
automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of
competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration
of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy
its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically
stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable
Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such
Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such holder, the percentage of Notes
held by the remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly
provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event
of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the trustee or the Collateral Agent, as
applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event
of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar
proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank.

For the avoidance of doubt, the trustee and the Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any
Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or
investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify
any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or
determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative
Instruments or otherwise. Neither the trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall have any liability or responsibility to the
Issuers, any holder or any other Person in connection with any Noteholder Direction or to determine whether or not
any holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture
or any other agreement.

The Issuers are required to deliver to the trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
indenture. Within 30 days of becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers are required to deliver
to the trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**No personal liability of directors, officers, employees and stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of an Issuer, Parent or any Guarantor, as such,
will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers, Parent or the Guarantors under the Indenture Documents or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by
accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for

84


-----

issuance of the Notes. The waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities
laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Legal defeasance and covenant defeasance**

The Issuers may at any time, at the option of its Board of Directors of Holdings evidenced by a resolution
set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, elect to have all of their obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding
Notes and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”)
except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal
of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to
below;

(2) the Issuers’ obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency
for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the trustee, and the Issuers’ and the
Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provisions of the indenture.

In addition, the Issuers may, at their option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuers and
the Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including their obligation to make Change of Control
Offers and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any
omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership,
rehabilitation and insolvency events) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute
an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the trustee (or such other entity designated by
the trustee for this purpose), in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in U.S. dollars,
non-callable Government Securities, or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government
Securities, in amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank,
appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, or interest or premium, if
any, on, the outstanding Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date,
as the case may be, and the Issuers must specify whether the Notes are being defeased to such stated date
for payment or to a particular redemption date; _provided that upon any redemption that requires the_
payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall be sufficient for purposes of the indenture
to the extent that an amount is deposited with the trustee equal to the Applicable Premium calculated by the
Issuers as of the date of the notice of redemption, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption only
required to be deposited with the trustee on or prior to the date of the redemption;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers must deliver to the trustee an Opinion of
Counsel reasonably acceptable to the trustee confirming that (a) the Issuers have received from, or there has
been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a
change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such
Opinion of Counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain
or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal
income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

85


-----

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers must deliver to the trustee an Opinion of
Counsel reasonably acceptable to the trustee confirming that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and
will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other than
a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any
similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of Liens to secure such
borrowing);

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of,
or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the indenture and the
agreements governing any other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which Holdings or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Issuers must deliver to the trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was
not made by the Issuers with the intent of preferring the holders of Notes over the other creditors of the
Issuers with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuers or others;
and

(7) the Issuers must deliver to the trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have
been complied with.

**Amendment, supplement and waiver**

Except as provided in the next four succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture Documents may be amended or
supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture Documents may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).

Without the consent of each holder of Notes affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with
respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) (a) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or (b) reduce the
amount payable upon the redemption of any Note, or in respect of an optional redemption, the times at
which the Note may be redeemed;

(3) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest, on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or
premium, if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

86


-----

(6) make any change in the provisions of the indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or
the contractual rights of holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest or premium, if any,
on, the Notes;

(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by
one of the covenants described above under the caption “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders”);

(8) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee, except as set
forth under the caption “—Note Guarantees”;

(9) contractually subordinate the Notes or any Note Guarantee to any other Indebtedness of
the Issuers or any Guarantor; or

(10) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

In addition, without the consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding, no amendment, supplement or waiver may release all or substantially all of the Collateral other than in
accordance with the Indenture Documents.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuers, the Guarantors and
the trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of an Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to holders of
Notes and Note Guarantees in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of such
Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of
Notes or that does not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture Documents of any such holder;

(5) to conform the text of the Indenture Documents to any provision of this “Description of
Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of Notes” was intended to be a verbatim
recitation of a provision thereof, as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate;

(6) to provide for the issuance of additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth
in the indenture;

(7) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or the Collateral Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof
or to provide for the accession by the trustee or Collateral Agent or any Collateral Document;

(8) to allow any additional Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note
Guarantee with respect to the Notes or to release a Guarantor from its Note Guarantee in accordance with
the terms of the indenture; or

(9) to enter into additional or supplemental Collateral Documents (including to add
Additional First Lien Secured Parties and Junior Lien Secured Parties to any Collateral Documents and to
secure any Additional First Lien Obligations) or to release Collateral from the Lien of the indenture or the
Collateral Documents in accordance with the terms of the indenture and the Collateral Documents.

The consent of holders of Notes is not necessary under the indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment.

87


-----

After an amendment under the indenture becomes effective, the Issuers are required to deliver to holders of
the Notes a notice briefly describing such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all holders of the
Notes, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect the validity of the amendment.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder,
when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
that have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust or
segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and thereafter repaid to the Issuers or discharged from
such trust, have been delivered to the trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the trustee for cancellation either
(x) have become due and payable by reason of the delivery of a notice of redemption or otherwise,
(y) will become due and payable within one year or (z) if redeemable at the option of the Issuers,
are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the trustee for
the giving of notice of redemption by the trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers,
and, in each case, an Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited
with the trustee (or such other entity designated by the trustee for this purpose) as trust funds in
trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities,
or a combination of cash in U.S. dollars and non-callable Government Securities, in amounts as
will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the
entire Indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the trustee for cancellation for principal and
premium, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption; _provided that upon_
any redemption that requires the payment of the Applicable Premium, the amount deposited shall
be sufficient for purposes of the indenture to the extent that an amount is deposited with the trustee
equal to the Applicable Premium calculated by the Issuers as of the date of the notice of
redemption, with any deficit as of the date of the redemption only required to be deposited with
the trustee on or prior to the date of the redemption;

(2) an Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the
Indenture Documents; and

(3) the Issuers have delivered irrevocable instructions to the trustee under the indenture to
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the
case may be.

In addition, the Issuers must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the trustee
stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Governing law**

The indenture will provide that it and the notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of New York.

**Specified transactions**

When calculating the availability under any basket, ratio or any financial metric under the Indenture or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture, in each case in connection with (a) any Limited Condition
Acquisition, (b) any repayment, redemption or repurchase of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock
with respect to which a notice of repayment or redemption (or similar notice), which may be conditional, has been

88


-----

delivered, (c) any dividends or distributions on, or redemptions of equity, in each case requiring declaration in
advance thereof, (d) the making of any Asset Sale or any disposition excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale,” or
(e) any other transaction or plan undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such Limited
Condition Acquisition or any transaction set forth in clauses (b) through (d) (the transactions referred to in clauses
(a) through (e), collectively, the “Specified Transactions,” and each, a “Specified Transaction”) and any actions or
transactions related thereto, the date of determination of such basket, ratio or financial metric or whether any such
Specified Transaction is permitted (or any requirement or conditions therefor is complied with or satisfied (including
as to the absence of any Default or Event of Default)) may, at the option of the Issuers, any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, a parent entity of the Issuers, any successor entity of any of the foregoing (including a third party) (the
“Testing Party”) (which election may be made on or prior to the date of consummation of such Specified
Transaction), be the date the definitive agreements for such Specified Transaction are entered into (or, if applicable,
the date of delivery of a binding offer, launch of a “certain funds” tender offer), the date of declaration of such
Restricted Payment, the date of the public announcement of such Specified Transaction, or the date such notice,
which may be conditional, of such repayment or redemption in connection with a repayment, redemption or
repurchase of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is given to the Holders of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock (any such date, the “Transaction Test Date”) and such baskets, ratios or
financial metrics shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro
forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definitions of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total
Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Indebtedness Ratio and Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Ratio after
giving effect to such Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto (including any incurrence
of Liens, Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) as if it occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for
purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Specified Transaction, and, for the avoidance of doubt,
(x) if any of such baskets, ratios or financial metrics are exceeded or otherwise have failed to be complied with as a
result of fluctuations in such basket, ratio or related financial metrics (including, but not limited to, due to
fluctuations in Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of the Issuer, the target company or the Person
that is otherwise the subject of the Specified Transaction for the Applicable Measurement Period) subsequent to
such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Specified Transaction and any actions
or transactions related thereto, such baskets, ratios or financial metrics will not be deemed to have been exceeded as
a result of such fluctuations and (y) such baskets, ratios or financial metrics shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto except as contemplated
in clause (a) of the immediately succeeding proviso; provided, however, that (a) if financial statements for one or
more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available subsequent to the date of determination, the Testing
Party may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such baskets, ratios and financial metrics on the basis of
such financial statements, in which case such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable
Transaction Test Date for purposes of such baskets, ratios and financial metrics, (b) if any ratios or financial metrics
improve or baskets increase as a result of such fluctuations, such improved ratios, financial metrics or baskets may
be utilized, (c) if the Testing Party elects to have such determinations occur at the Transaction Test Date, any such
transactions (including the Specified Transaction and any actions or transactions related thereto) shall be deemed to
have occurred on the Transaction Test Date and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets,
ratios or financial metrics under the Indenture after the Transaction Test Date and before the consummation of such
Specified Transaction unless and until such Specified Transaction has been abandoned, as determined by the Testing
Party, prior to the consummation thereof, (d) to the extent that proceeds from any Asset Sale or any disposition
excluded from the definition of “Asset Sale,” (to the extent not otherwise applied) constitutes cash and Cash
Equivalents, the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Secured Indebtedness Ratio and Consolidated
First Lien Indebtedness Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma effect to such proceeds and (e) Consolidated
Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate
based on the indicative interest margin, as reasonably determined by the Testing Party in good faith. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the Testing Party has exercised its option pursuant to the foregoing and any Default or Event
of Default occurs following the Transaction Test Date (including any new Transaction Test Date) for the applicable
Specified Transaction and prior to or on the date of the consummation of such Specified Transaction, any such
Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for purposes of determining
whether any action being taken in connection with such Specified Transaction is permitted under the Indenture.

89


-----

**Certain compliance determinations**

The Indenture shall also provide that, for purposes of determining any calculation or measure as of any
Applicable Calculation Date, date of determination or Transaction Test Date (including, without limitation,
Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Ratio, Consolidated
Secured Indebtedness Ratio, Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, Consolidated EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, Fixed Charges, Permitted Receivables Financing and Consolidated Total Assets) under the Indenture, the U.S.
dollar equivalent amount of any amount denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated, to the extent not
already reflected in U.S. dollars in the relevant financial statements (which may be internal), based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements
are available immediately preceding the Applicable Calculation Date.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or preferred stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued, any Lien is incurred other transaction is undertaken
in reliance on a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Indebtedness Ratio or Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, such ratio(s) shall be calculated
with respect to such incurrence, issuance or other transaction without giving effect to amounts being utilized under
any other basket (other than a ratio basket based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien
Indebtedness Ratio, Consolidated Secured Indebtedness Ratio or Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio) on the same
date. Each item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is incurred or issued, each Lien incurred
and each other transaction undertaken will be deemed to have been incurred, issued or taken first, to the extent
available, pursuant to the relevant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated First Lien Indebtedness Ratio,
Consolidated Secured Indebtedness Ratio or Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio test.

If Holdings or a Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment which at the time of the making of such
Restricted Payment would in the good faith determination of Holdings be permitted under the provisions of the
Indenture, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustments made in good faith to the Holdings’ financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated EBITDA of Holdings for any period.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in connection with a Testing Party’s election to use a Transaction
Test Date in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition or Specified Transaction, any reference to “date of
incurrence” or “time of incurrence” or other similar phrases with respect to the date or time an action is taken herein
will mean the Transaction Test Date.

**Registration rights**

Holdings and its Subsidiaries will not be obligated under any registration rights agreement or other
obligation to register the notes for resale or to exchange the notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The indenture will not be qualified under the TIA and Holdings and its
Subsidiaries will not be required to comply with the provisions of the TIA. The absence of registration rights may
adversely impact the transferability of the notes.

**Concerning the trustee**

If the trustee becomes a creditor of an Issuer or any Guarantor, the indenture limits the right of the trustee
to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim
as security or otherwise. The trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; _however, if it acquires any_
conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days or resign.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the trustee,
subject to certain exceptions. The indenture provides that in the event that an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing (of which a Trust Officer of the trustee has received actual written notice at its corporate trust office), the
trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person in the conduct of

90


-----

such person’s own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its
rights or powers under the indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the
trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

and perfected security interest in any Collateral at such time, then such Collateral shall constitute Shared Collateral

“Third Party Funds” means any segregated accounts or funds, or any portion thereof, received by Holdings
or any of its Subsidiaries as agent on behalf of third parties (other than the Issuers or the Guarantors) in accordance
with a written agreement that imposes a duty upon Holdings or one or more of its Subsidiaries to collect and remit

Treasury Securities for which such yields are given, except that if the period from the redemption date to
, 2027 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actively traded United States Treasury Securities adjusted
to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

“Trust Officer” when used with respect to the trustee, shall mean an officer of the trustee in the Corporate

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

The certificates representing the notes will be issued in fully registered form without interest coupons.

Notes sold in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act initially will be represented by permanent
global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Restricted Global Note”) and will be
deposited with the Trustee as a custodian for DTC, as depositary, and registered in the name of a nominee of such
depositary. Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act initially will be
represented by temporary global notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Temporary
Regulation S Global Note”) and will be deposited with the Trustee as custodian for DTC, as depositary, and
registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary. Prior to the 40th day after the later of the commencement of
the offering and the closing of the offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the “distribution
compliance period”), a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note may be held only through
Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”), and Clearstream Banking, _societe_
_anonyme (“Clearstream”) (as indirect participants in DTC), unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through_
a Restricted Global Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below. Each Temporary
Regulation S Global Note will be exchangeable for a single permanent global note (each, a “Permanent Regulation S
Global Note” and, together with the Temporary Regulation S Global Note, a “Regulation S Global Note” and
together with the Restricted Global Note, the “Global Notes”) after the expiration of the distribution compliance
period and the certification required by Regulation S. Prior to such time, a beneficial interest in the Temporary
Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the
Restricted Global Note only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification from the transferor to the effect
that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional
buyer, or QIB, in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A. Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global
Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note
whether before, on or after such time, only upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification to the effect that
such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S.

The Global Notes (and any notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on
transfer set forth therein and in the Indenture and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth under the
heading “Transfer Restrictions” herein. QIBs or non-U.S. purchasers may elect to take a Certificated Security (as
defined below under “—Certificated Securities”) instead of holding their interests through the Global Notes, which
certificated notes will be ineligible to trade through DTC (collectively referred to herein as the “Non-Global
Purchasers”) only in the limited circumstances described below. Upon the transfer to a QIB of any Certificated
Security initially issued to a Non-Global Purchaser, such Certificated Security will, unless the transferee requests
otherwise or the Global Notes have previously been exchanged in whole for Certificated Securities, be exchanged
for an interest in the Global Notes. For a description of the restrictions on transfer of Certificated Securities and any
interest in the Global Notes, see “Transfer restrictions.”

**The Global Notes**

We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes,
DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial
interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such
depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the
transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to
interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants).
Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants.
Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or
indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system.

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the
case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all
purposes under the Indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that
interest except in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if

131


-----

applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), in addition to those provided for under the Indenture with respect to
the notes.

Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC
or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Trustee or
any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made
on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial ownership interest.

We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and
interest on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their
respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its
nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held
through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with
securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such
payments will be the responsibility of such participants.

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds
system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of
a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal
procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and transfers between participants in
Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a noteholder (including the
presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose
account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if
there is an event of default under the Indenture, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for
Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the
heading “Transfer Restrictions.”

DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York
banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal
Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a
“clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and
provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants
deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities
transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between
participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include
both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain
other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and
non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly.

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the
Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures
may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and
procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Securities**

A Global Note is exchangeable for certificated notes in fully registered form without interest coupons
(“Certificated Securities”) only in the following limited circumstances:

132


-----

- DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Note and we fail to
appoint a successor depositary within 90 days of such notice, or

- there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default with respect to the notes under the Indenture and
DTC shall have requested the issuance of Certificated Securities.

Certificated Securities may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the
transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that
such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Transfer
restrictions.” In no event shall the Regulation S Global Note be exchanged for Certificated Securities prior to (a) the
expiration of the distribution compliance period and (b) the receipt of any certificates required under the provisions
of Regulation S.

The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities
that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer the notes will be limited to such extent.

**Exchanges between Regulation S Notes and Restricted Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period, beneficial interests in the Temporary
Regulation S Global Note may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A;
and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that the notes are being transferred to a person:

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer
within the meaning of Rule 144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer
in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United
States and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the distribution
compliance period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or
Rule 144 (if available).

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the
Restricted Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Trustee through the
DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate
adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a
corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any
beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an
interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an
interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other
procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The
policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers of beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global
Note prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period.

133


-----

**Certification by holders of the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes**

A holder of a beneficial interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes must provide Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be, with a certificate in the form required by the Indenture certifying that the beneficial
owner of the interest in the Temporary Regulation S Global Note is either a non-U.S. person or a U.S. person that
has purchased such interest in a transaction that is exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities
Act, and Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, must provide to the Trustee (or the paying agent if other than
the Trustee) a certificate in the form required by the Indenture, prior to any exchange of such beneficial interest for a
beneficial interest in the Permanent Regulation S Global Notes.

**Same-day settlement and payment**

Payments in respect of the notes represented by the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, and
interest) will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the Global Note
holder. With respect to any notes in certificated form, we will make all payments of principal, premium, if any, and
interest, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof or, if no
such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. The notes represented by the
Global Notes are expected to be eligible to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted
secondary market trading activity in such Global Notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be settled in
immediately available funds.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which
must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. DTC has
advised us that cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or
through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a Participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement
date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day
for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below and collectively referred to as “Holders”) of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of notes. This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
regulations of the Treasury promulgated or proposed thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”), administrative
pronouncements and judicial decisions, all as of the date of this offering memorandum and all of which are subject
to change (possibly with retroactive effect).

This summary addresses only Holders who acquire the notes pursuant to this offering memorandum for
cash at original issue and at their original “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first
price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers
or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and hold
their notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment). This summary does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant
to Holders in light of their particular circumstances or to Holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal
income tax law, such as banks or other financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment
trusts, individual retirement and other tax deferred accounts, dealers or brokers in securities or currencies, traders in
securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting, insurance companies, entities treated as partnerships or
other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or investors therein), tax-exempt entities,
corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, U.S. expatriates, persons holding notes in a
hedging, integrated or conversion transaction or as a position in a constructive sale, straddle or wash sale, or U.S.
Holders whose “functional currency” is other than the U.S. dollar or persons that are required to report income no
later than when such income is reported in an “applicable financial statement.” This summary does not address any
U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, U.S. federal tax other than income tax (e.g., estate or gift tax), or state, local
or non-U.S. tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of notes. We have not requested, and will
not request, a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the U.S. federal
income tax consequences described below. As a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court considering
these issues will agree with any of the conclusions we have reached and describe herein or that a court would not
sustain a challenge by the IRS in the event of litigation.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation that is organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

- a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of
such trust and one or more “United States persons” within the meaning of Section 7701 of the Code (“U.S.
Persons") have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) the trust has a valid election
in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. Person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, trust or estate that is not a U.S. Holder.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds notes, the tax
treatment of a partner in or other owner of such an entity generally will depend on the status of the partner or other
owner and the activities of the entity. Partners (or other owners) in a partnership (or other pass-through entity or
arrangement) considering an investment in notes are urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the particular U.S.
federal income tax considerations applicable to them or the partnership’s (or other pass-through entity’s) purchase,
ownership, or disposition of the notes.

135


-----

**This summary does not constitute, and should not be considered as, legal or tax advice to prospective**
**investors of the notes. Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with regard to the**
**application of the tax considerations discussed below to their particular situations as well as the application of**
**any state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws, including gift and estate tax laws.**

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of the stated interest or principal
on the notes, including as described under “Description of notes—Change of Control.” These potential payments
may implicate the provisions of Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” According
to the applicable Treasury Regulations, certain contingencies (e.g., contingencies that are in the aggregate, as of the
date of issuance, “remote” or “incidental”) will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a contingent payment
debt instrument. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that, as of the date of
issuance, the foregoing contingency and any other contingencies to which payments on the notes are subject do not
cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

Our position that the notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a Holder, unless such
Holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations (generally, on its
U.S. federal income tax return for the year during which the Holder acquires notes). Our position is not, however,
binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to successfully challenge this position, a Holder might be required to accrue
interest income on the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and to treat any gain recognized on the
taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. The Treasury Regulations applicable to
contingent payment debt instruments have not been the subject of authoritative interpretation, however, and the
scope of such Treasury Regulations is not certain. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the
possible application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the notes. The remainder of this discussion
assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**U.S. Holders**

**_Stated Interest_**

Generally, stated interest payments on a note to a U.S. Holder will be taxable as ordinary interest income at
the time the payments are accrued or received, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method of tax
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the stated principal amount of the notes exceeds their issue price by an amount greater than or equal to a
statutorily defined de minimis amount (i.e., ¼ of 1% multiplied by the complete years to maturity), the notes will be
treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the
excess of the stated principal amount over the issue price of the notes.

If the notes are treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder generally
will be required to include in taxable income (as ordinary income) such OID as it accrues on a constant yield to
maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to such OID, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s
regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of OID that a U.S. Holder would
be required to include in income for each taxable year (or potion thereof) during which the U.S. Holder is the
beneficial owner of a note is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to such note for each day during
such taxable year (or portion thereof), as determined pursuant to applicable Treasury Regulations.

**_Taxable Dispositions_**

Generally, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note will result in
taxable gain or loss to a U.S. Holder equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the disposition
(excluding amounts attributable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest or accrued OID, which will be taxed as

136


-----

ordinary income to the extent not previously so taxed) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. The
amount realized will equal the sum of any cash and the fair market value of any other property received on the
disposition (excluding amounts attributable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest). A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in a note will generally equal the cost of such note to such U.S. Holder increased by the amount of any OID
previously included in income by the U.S. Holder with respect to the note. Such gain or loss will generally be capital
gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the note is held for more than one year. Certain
non-corporate U.S. Holders may be eligible for preferential rates of U.S. federal income tax in respect of long-term
capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

**_Additional Tax on Passive Income_**

U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts, and whose income exceeds certain thresholds, are
required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other items, interest income and capital gains from the sale or
other taxable disposition of a note, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. U.S. Holders are urged to consult
their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this additional tax on their ownership and disposition of a note.

**Non-U.S. Holders**

**_Interest_**

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code
(“FATCA”), U.S. federal income or withholding tax generally will not apply to a non-U.S. Holder in respect of any
payment of interest (which, for purposes of this discussion of Non-U.S. Holders, includes any OID) on the notes,
provided that such payment is not effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business
in the United States and:

- such Non-U.S. Holder does not own actually or constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power
of all classes of our voting stock within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations;

- such Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is, actually or constructively, related to the
Issuers under the applicable provisions of the Code;

- such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on the notes is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Code; and

- either (1) such Non-U.S. Holder provides identifying information (i.e., name and address) to the applicable
withholding agent on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable (or successor form), and certifies, under
penalty of perjury, that such Non-U.S. Holder is not a U.S. Person or (2) a financial institution holding the notes
on behalf of such Non-U.S. Holder certifies, under penalty of perjury, that it has received such a certification
from the beneficial owner and, when required, provides the withholding agent with a copy.

If a Non-U.S. Holder does not satisfy the requirements described above, payments of interest made to such
Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides the
applicable withholding agent with a properly executed (1) applicable IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as
applicable (or successor form), claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under an applicable income
tax treaty or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to
withholding tax because it is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in
the United States (in which case such interest will be subject to tax as discussed below).

The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the
payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide the applicable
withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax
treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the
IRS. Non-U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any
applicable income tax treaty.

**_Taxable Dispositions_**

Subject to the discussions below of backup withholding and of FATCA, any gain recognized on the sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note by a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be
subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax (except to the extent attributable to accrued and unpaid interest,
which will be taxable as described above) unless (1) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States by such Non-U.S. Holder (in which case such gain will be subject to regular graduated
U.S. income tax rates as described below) or (2) such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United
States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that disposition and certain other conditions are met (in which case
such gain, net of certain U.S.-source losses, if any, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat rate of 30% (or
at a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty)).

**_Effectively Connected Interest or Gain_**

If a Non-U.S. Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on a note or gain
from the disposition of a note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, such Non-U.S.
Holder will, subject to any applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise, be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on such interest or gain on a net income basis in generally the same manner as if such Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S.
Holder. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may be subject
to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lower applicable income tax treaty rate) of its effectively connected
earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments.

**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

**_U.S. Holders_**

A U.S. Holder will be subject to information reporting with respect to payments of stated interest on a note,
accruals of OID and payments of the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) of a note, unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup
withholding on payments of such amounts if such U.S. Holder is not otherwise exempt and such U.S. Holder:

- fails to furnish to the applicable withholding agent its correct taxpayer identification number (“TIN”), which,
for an individual, is ordinarily such individual’s social security number;

- fails to certify to the applicable withholding agent, under penalties of perjury, that it has furnished a correct TIN
and that the IRS has not notified the U.S. Holder that it is subject to backup withholding (including because the
U.S. Holder has previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends); or

- otherwise fails to comply with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.

U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding,
the availability of an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if
available.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of
interest (including any OID) to such Non-U.S. Holder if such Non-U.S. Holder properly certifies to the applicable
withholding agent that it is not a U.S. Person. A Non-U.S. Holder will, however, be subject to information reporting
requirements with respect to payments of interest on the notes.

Proceeds from the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a note made to or
through a foreign office of a foreign broker without certain specified connections to the United States will generally
not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding. A Non-U.S. Holder may be subject to backup
withholding and/or information reporting with respect to the proceeds of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption

138


-----

or other taxable disposition of a note within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related financial
intermediaries, unless the non-U.S. Holder properly certifies to the applicable withholding agent that it is not a U.S.
Person, or such non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption.

Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions
of an applicable treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides, is
established or is engaged in business.

**_General—U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders_**

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
will be allowed as a credit against a Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and may entitle a Holder to a refund,
provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act**

FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on certain types of payments made to a foreign financial
institution (including in the capacity as intermediary), unless the foreign financial institution enters into an
agreement with the U.S. Treasury Department to, among other things, undertake to identify accounts held by certain
U.S. persons or U.S.-owned entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on
payments to account holders whose actions prevent it from complying with these and other reporting requirements,
or unless the foreign financial institution is otherwise exempt from those requirements. Certain countries have
entered into, and other countries are expected to enter into, agreements with the United States to facilitate the type of
information reporting required under FATCA. Such intergovernmental agreements may provide different rules with
respect to foreign financial institutions. In addition, FATCA imposes a 30% withholding tax on the same types of
payments to a non-financial foreign entity (including in the capacity as an intermediary) unless the entity certifies
that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners, the entity furnishes identifying information regarding each
substantial U.S. owner or an exemption applies. A foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity’s
failure to comply with the additional certification, information reporting and other specified requirements imposed
under FATCA could result in the 30% withholding tax being imposed on any “withholdable payment.” For this
purpose, withholdable payments generally include U.S.-source payments otherwise subject to nonresident
withholding tax (e.g., U.S.-source interest (including any OID)) and, subject to the following two sentences, also
include the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition (including a settlement or redemption) of any debt
instruments of U.S. issuers. The U.S. Treasury Department released proposed regulations which, if finalized in their
present form, would eliminate the U.S. federal withholding tax imposed under FATCA on the gross proceeds of a
sale or disposition of debt instruments. In its preamble to the proposed regulations, the U.S. Treasury Department
stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Prospective
investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding FATCA and its effect on them.

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The United States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and the
corollary provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, impose certain requirements on “employee benefit plans” (as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that are subject to Title I of ERISA and plans, arrangements, and accounts that
are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, respectively, including entities such as collective investment funds and
separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on
those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. The U.S. Department of Labor has promulgated
regulations 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, which were effectively modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, describing
what constitutes the assets of an ERISA Plan with respect to the ERISA Plan’s investment in an entity for purposes
of certain provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, including the fiduciary responsibility provisions of
Title I of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any
discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition
of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an
ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject
to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirements of investment prudence and diversification
and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the
ERISA Plan and applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. The prudence of a particular investment must be
determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular
circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment including, but not limited to, the matters
discussed above under “Risk factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary
will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the notes. Similar requirements may apply to investments by plans,
arrangements, or accounts, such as governmental plans, certain church plans, and non-U.S. plans, and entities such
as collective investment funds and separate accounts whose underlying assets include the assets of such plans,
arrangements or accounts (collectively, “Other Plan Investors”), that are subject to laws, regulations or policies that
are similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”).

Each ERISA Plan and Other Plan Investor should consider the fact that none of the Issuers, the initial
purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates will act as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor with
respect to the decision to acquire notes and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give
advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision.

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” or “disqualified persons”) having certain
relationships to such ERISA Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A
party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise
taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the
ERISA Plan who engaged in such non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code.

Prohibited transactions within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may arise
if the notes are acquired with the assets of an ERISA Plan with respect to which an Issuer, the initial purchasers, the
trustee, the lenders under the Existing Credit Facilities, or any of their respective affiliates is a party in interest or a
disqualified person. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and
Section 4975 of the Code may be applicable, however, depending in part on the type of ERISA Plan fiduciary
making the decision to acquire a note and the circumstances under which such decision is made. However, there can
be no assurance that any administrative or statutory exemption will be available with respect to any particular
transaction involving the notes.

Other Plan Investors, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the
provisions of Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such plans
should consult with their counsel before acquiring the notes.

140


-----

**Representations and further considerations**

By its acquisition of notes, each purchaser and subsequent transferee thereof will be deemed to have
represented and warranted, either that (a) it is not an ERISA Plan and is not using the assets of an ERISA Plan or
any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, by reason of an ERISA Plan’s investment in the entity, nor is it an Other Plan
Investor subject to any Similar Law or using the assets of an Other Plan Investor or any entity whose underlying
assets include “plan assets” by reason of an Other Plan Investor’s investment in the entity, or (b) neither its sale,
disposition, transfer, acquisition, or holding of a note will constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Law,
and none of the Issuers, the initial purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates is its fiduciary in connection with
the acquisition and holding of the notes.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity
of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it
is particularly important that any fiduciary of an ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor or other person who proposes to
use assets of any ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor to acquire the notes should consult with its counsel regarding
the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code, and any applicable Similar Laws, to such an investment, and to confirm that such investment will not
constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of
ERISA, the Code, or any applicable Similar Laws.

The sale of the notes to an ERISA Plan, an Other Plan Investor or to a person using assets of any ERISA
Plan or Other Plan Investor to effect its acquisition of the notes, is in no respect a representation by an Issuer or the
initial purchasers that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by
ERISA Plans or Other Plan Investors generally or any particular ERISA Plan or Other Plan Investor or that such an
investment is appropriate for ERISA Plans or Other Plan Investors generally or any particular ERISA Plan or Other
Plan Investor.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions in the purchase agreement among the Issuers, the guarantors and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers, the Issuers have agreed to sell to the
initial purchasers, and the initial purchasers, severally and not jointly, have agreed to purchase from the Issuers, the
principal amount of the notes set forth opposite their names below.

**Principal amount**

**Initial Purchasers** **of notes**

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ................................................................. $
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC ..................................................................
RBC Capital Markets, LLC ..................................................................
BofA Securities, Inc. ...........................................................................
Barclays Capital Inc. ...........................................................................
Jefferies LLC ........................................................................................
CIBC World Markets Corp. ................................................................


Total ..................................................................................................... $ 500,000,000

The initial purchasers have advised us that they propose initially to offer the notes for resale at the issue
price that appears on the cover of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may
change the offering price and any other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell notes through certain
of their affiliates.

In the purchase agreement, we have agreed that:

- for a period of 45 days after the date of this offering memorandum, we will not offer, sell, contract to sell or
otherwise dispose of any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuers, VFH or any of the other guarantors
and having a tenor of more than one year without the prior consent of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; and

- we will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act,
or contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any
other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.” In the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers have agreed that:

- the notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration
requirements; and

- during the initial distribution of the notes, they will offer or sell notes only to persons reasonably believed to be
qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and to certain non-U.S. persons outside the United
States in compliance with Regulation S.

In addition, with respect to the notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with
Regulation S, until 40 days following the closing of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States
by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities
Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration
under the Securities Act.

The notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the notes. In
addition, the notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer
Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the notes to be listed on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the
notes on any automated dealer quotation system. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to

142


-----

make a market in the notes, but are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue any market
making in the notes at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will
develop for the notes, that you will be able to sell your notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive
when you sell will be favorable. If an active trading market for the notes does not develop, the market price and
liquidity of the notes may be adversely affected. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their
initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating
performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes
and other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the offering of the notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which
creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the notes in the
open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the notes. Syndicate covering transactions
involve purchases of the notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short
positions. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchasers are concerned that there may be
downward pressure on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors
who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may .have the effect of
raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the
notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the notes. If the initial
purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, it may discontinue them at any time.

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial
purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes
offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the
notes offered hereby.

The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The initial
purchasers and certain of their affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various
financial advisory and investment and commercial banking services for us and our affiliates, for which they received
or will receive customary fees and expenses. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates
act as lenders and/or agents under the Existing Credit Facilities, and such initial purchasers or their respective
affiliates may therefore receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering in connection with the refinancing of
the Existing Term Loan Facility as part of the Refinancing Transactions. See “Use of proceeds.” In addition, certain
of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates will be lenders, agents and/or arrangers under the Amended
Credit Facilities and will receive customary compensation in connection therewith. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. is a lender under the Committed Facility.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers.
The initial purchasers and certain of their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

143


-----

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the closing date
specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the        business day following the date
of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange
Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one
business day before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle T+    , to
specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of notes
who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery should consult their own advisors.

**Notice to prospective investors in the European Economic Area**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in a member state of the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a “professional client” as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified
investor” as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and
therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be
unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of
notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from
the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Notice to prospective investors in the United Kingdom**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”). For these purposes, a
“retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “U.K. Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information
document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the
“U.K. PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation.

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the notes in the U.K. will be
made pursuant to an exemption under section 86 of the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the U.K. Prospectus Regulation.

This offering memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the U.K. This offering
memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion)
Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d)
(high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the
United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within
the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise
lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant
persons”). This offering memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by

persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this offering memorandum
relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**Notice to prospective investors in Canada**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are
accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the
_Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103_ _Registration_
_Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in_
accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable
securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies
for rescission or damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a
misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the
time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer
to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of
these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

**Notice to prospective investors in Hong Kong**

The notes have not been offered or sold, and the notes may not be offered or sold, in Hong Kong, by means
of any document, other than to persons whose ordinary business is to buy or sell shares or debentures, whether as

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

Unless we cause the restrictive legend to be removed from the notes and cause the notes to be freely
tradable without a restricted CUSIP number, the following restrictions will apply to the notes and purchasers are
advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the notes. See
“Description of notes.”

The offer and sale of the notes and the guarantees thereof have not been registered under the Securities Act
and, accordingly, the notes may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of,
U.S. persons except in transactions exempt from, or not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act. Accordingly, the notes are being offered and sold only (1) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified
institutional buyers” under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons
in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented to
and agreed with us and the initial purchasers as follows:

1. It is not an “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) and is not acting on our
behalf, and it is either a:

        - “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A promulgated under the
Securities Act and is aware that any sale of notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A,
and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the account of another qualified
institutional buyer; or

        - person that, at the time the buy order for the notes was originated, was outside the United
States and was not a U.S. person (and was not purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S.
person) within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act.

2. The notes are being offered for resale in a transaction not involving any public offering in the
United States within the meaning of the Securities Act. The notes have not been registered under
the Securities Act or any U.S. securities laws, and they are being offered for resale in transactions
not requiring registration under the Securities Act. The notes may not be reoffered, resold, pledged
or otherwise transferred except:

        - to a person whom the purchaser reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A;

        - in an offshore transaction complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S;

        - pursuant to the exemption from registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144
thereunder (if available);

        - to an institutional “accredited investor” (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3), (7), (8), (9),
(12) or (13) of Regulation D under the Securities Act) that, prior to such transfer, furnishes
the trustee a signed letter containing certain representations and agreements relating to the
transfer of the notes and, if such transfer is in respect of an aggregate principal amount of
notes less than $250,000, an opinion of counsel acceptable to us, if we so request, that the
transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act;

        - in accordance with another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
(and based upon an opinion of counsel acceptable to us, if we so request);

        - to us; or

147


-----

    - pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,

and, in each case, in accordance with all applicable U.S. state securities laws.

The purchaser will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser
from it of the resale restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence. No representation is being
made as to the availability of the exemption provided by Rule 144 for resale of the notes.

decision with respect to the notes. It acknowledges that no representation or warranty is made by
the initial purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. It further acknowledges
that neither we nor the initial purchasers, nor any person representing any such party, has made
any representation to it with respect to us or the offering or sale of any notes other than the
information contained in this offering memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision
to purchase any of the notes, including any opportunity to ask questions of and request
information from us and the initial purchasers.

4. It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of beneficial
interests in a note in global form (a “Global Note”) (in each case other than pursuant to an
effective registration statement), the noteholder or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global
Note, as the case may be, may be required to provide certifications and other documentation
relating to the manner of such transfer and submit such certifications and other documentation as
provided in the Indenture.

substantially to the following effect unless otherwise agreed by us and the holder thereof:

BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER HEREOF REPRESENTS THAT IT IS NOT
A U.S. PERSON, NOR IS IT PURCHASING FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A U.S. PERSON, AND
IS ACQUIRING THIS SECURITY IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN ACCORDANCE
WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

6. It acknowledges that the registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any
notes acquired by it, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the trustee that the
restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

7. If it is an acquirer in a transaction that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S, it acknowledges that until the expiration of the “40-day distribution compliance
period” within the meaning of Rule 903 of Regulation S, any offer or sale of these notes shall not
be made by it to a U.S. person or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of
Rule 902 under the Securities Act, except in compliance with applicable securities laws.

8. It represents and warrants either that: (a) it is not an ERISA Plan and is not using the assets of an
ERISA Plan or any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” within the meaning of
29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, by reason of an ERISA
Plan’s investment in the entity, nor is it an Other Plan Investor subject to any Similar Law or using
the assets of an Other Plan Investor or any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by
reason of an Other Plan Investor’s investment in the entity, or (b) neither its sale, disposition,
transfer, acquisition, or holding of a note will constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under
any applicable Similar Law, and none of the Issuers, the initial purchasers nor any of their
respective affiliates is its fiduciary in connection with the acquisition and holding of the notes.

9. It acknowledges that we, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of
the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgments, representations or agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the
notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify us and the initial purchasers. If it is acquiring

investment discretion with respect to each such account and it has full power to make the
foregoing acknowledgments, representations, and agreements on behalf of each account.
