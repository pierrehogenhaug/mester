311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,233,SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,233.1,"USE OF NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT Margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin",233.1.1,,"To supplement our financial information presented in this offering memorandum and in the documents incorporated by reference herein that are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), we use the following non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. Management uses these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures in the analysis of our financial and operating performance because they assist in the evaluation of underlying trends in our business. We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. EBIT consists of net income before interest expense, net, and provision (benefit) for income taxes. EBITDA consists of net income before interest expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA consist of EBIT and EBITDA, respectively, adjusted for (i) certain non-cash items included within net income, (ii) certain items we do not believe are indicative of ongoing operating performance or (iii) certain non-recurring, unusual or infrequent items that have not otherwise occurred within the last two years or that we believe are not reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. We believe that making such adjustments provides investors meaningful information to understand our operating results and ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis. Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin are calculated by dividing Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, by net sales. We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may differ from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance or operating cash flows or as measures of liquidity. EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have important limitations as analytical tools and should be considered in conjunction with, and not as substitutes for, our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin: - do not reflect the significant interest expense on our debt, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Notes (as defined herein); and - eliminate the impact of income taxes on our results of operations; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any expenditures for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry may calculate EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by using EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S. GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, net income and other performance measures. ----- In calculating these financial measures, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. In addition, in evaluating these financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual items. For an explanation of the components of EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, see footnotes (2), (3), (4) and (5) in “Offering Memorandum Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data.” The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of “non-U.S. GAAP financial measures,” such as EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBIT margin, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and ratios related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are publicly presented and require, among other things: - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and - a statement disclosing the purposes for which the registrant’s management uses the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: - the exclusion of charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement or would have required cash settlement, absent an ability to settle in another manner, from a non-U.S. GAAP liquidity measure; and - the adjustment of a non-U.S. GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it has occurred in the past two years or is reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum may not comply with the SEC rules governing the presentation of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. See “Offering Memorandum Summary—Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data” for a discussion of our use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum including the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and investors, and a reconciliation of EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The balance sheet data as of September 30, 2023 and the statement of operations data for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 have been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which is incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.

We have also presented summary unaudited consolidated financial data for the LTM Period, which is not a presentation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This data has been calculated by subtracting the unaudited statements of operations and cash flow data for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 from the audited statements of operations and cash flow data for the year ended December 31, 2022 and then adding the unaudited statements of operations and cash flow data for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. We have presented this financial data because we believe it provides our investors with useful information to assess our recent performance. Our historical financial data are not necessarily indicative of our future performance. You should read the information contained in this table in conjunction with the section titled “Capitalization” in this offering memorandum and the sections titled “Selected Financial Information” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,"Risks Related to the Notes Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy and our industry and our flexibility in managing our business, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Notes offered hereby and our other indebtedness.",13.1.1,,"As a result of our substantial indebtedness, a significant amount of our cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility, to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the Notes offered hereby, or to fund our other liquidity needs. As of September 30, 2023, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Refinancing Transactions, we would have had total indebtedness of $3,563.2 million, including the Notes offered hereby, and we would have had unused commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility available to us of $550.0 million (without giving effect to $20.3 million of outstanding letters of credit). Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to the holders of the Notes offered hereby. For example, it could: - limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes; - require us to devote a substantial portion of our annual cash flow to the payment of interest on our indebtedness; - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, such as the meaningful interest rate increases during 2022 and 2023, as, over the term of our debt, the interest cost on a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to changes in interest rates; - hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; - limit our flexibility in managing our business through our obligation to comply with customary financial and other covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including the indentures governing the Remaining Notes, the Indenture and the Credit Agreement, as discussed under “—The terms of the indentures governing the Remaining Notes and the Credit Agreement restrict, and the Indenture will restrict, our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term interests;” - limit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions or at all; and - increase our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses. We are more leveraged than some of our competitors, which could adversely affect our business plans. A relatively greater portion of our cash flow than that of our competitors is used to service debt and other financial obligations. This reduces the funds we have available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes and may make it more difficult for us to borrow in the future. Similarly, our relatively greater leverage increases our vulnerability to, and limits our flexibility in planning for, adverse economic and industry conditions and creates other competitive disadvantages compared with other companies with relatively less leverage. In addition, the indentures governing the Remaining Notes and the Credit Agreement contain, and the Indenture will contain, affirmative and negative covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in activities that may be in our longterm best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,"To service all of our indebtedness, including the Notes offered hereby, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.",13.2.1,,"Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes offered hereby, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. Our ability to generate cash is dependent on the earnings and receipt of funds from our subsidiaries and joint ventures, which businesses are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including planned capital expenditures. In such circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Remaining Notes and the Notes offered hereby, at or before their respective maturities. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, issuing additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Such actions, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The instruments governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to sell assets and to use the proceeds from such sales, and we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness, and we may not be able to obtain waivers of such defaults from our lenders. In the event of such un-waived default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,"Despite our current level of indebtedness and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness or we may pay dividends in the future. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.",13.3.1,,"We and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness under the agreements governing our indebtedness. Although the indentures governing the Remaining Notes and the Credit Agreement contain, and the Indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that, although preferential to our common shares in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness. As of September 30, 2023, the Revolving Credit Facility provided for unused commitments of $550.0 million (without giving effect to $20.3 million of our outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Credit Facility). Additionally, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may be increased by an amount up to the greater of $783.0 million and 100% of our trailing four-quarter Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at the time of the increase, plus an unlimited amount subject to a maximum leverage requirement described in the Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions. Those borrowings would be senior secured indebtedness, junior secured indebtedness or unsecured indebtedness. If new debt is added to our and/or our subsidiaries’ debt levels, the related risks that we and the guarantors now face as a result of our leverage would intensify. Additionally, the indentures governing the Remaining Notes and the Credit Agreement permit, and the Indenture will permit, us to pay dividends or make other restricted payments in the future. For example, the “builder” capacity to make restricted payments based on our consolidated net income (as such term is defined in such indentures or the Credit Agreement, as applicable) is approximately $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion under the indentures governing the Remaining Notes and the Credit Agreement, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. Any dividends or other restricted payments will reduce our cash available to service our indebtedness and the related risks that we and the guarantors now face would increase. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of Notes.”",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,"The terms of the indentures governing the Remaining Notes and the Credit Agreement restrict, and the Indenture will restrict, our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term interests.",13.4.1,,"----- The indentures governing the Remaining Notes and the Credit Agreement contain, and the Indenture will contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to: - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; - make loans and investments; - sell or otherwise dispose of assets; - incur liens; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - alter the businesses we conduct; - designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; - enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. As a result of all of these restrictions, we may be: - limited in how we conduct our business; - unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or - unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. These restrictions might hinder our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, the financial covenant in the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a first lien net leverage ratio that does not exceed 5.50:1.00 at the end of any quarter when the aggregate amount of outstanding revolving loans, swingline loans and letter of credit obligations (excluding (i) up to $20 million of non-cash collateralized letters of credit and (ii) all letters of credit that are cash collateralized to at least 103% of their maximum stated amount) exceeds more than 30% of the aggregate amount of all commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at such date. The financial covenant is only applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to meet the financial covenant could be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of the covenants under the indentures governing the Remaining Notes, the Indenture or the Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to an applicable cross-acceleration or crossdefault provision. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.

If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed may remain the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our other indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all revolving loans are fully drawn (and to the extent that any of the Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate and the SONIA Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) are in excess of the applicable floor rate set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), each oneeighth percent change in interest rates would result in a $2.8 million change in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

The Notes offered hereby will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations of any non-guarantor subsidiary such that in the event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any subsidiary that is not a guarantor, all of that subsidiary’s creditors (including trade creditors) would be entitled to payment in full out of that subsidiary’s assets before we would be entitled to any payment from that subsidiary. In addition, subject to some limitations, the indentures governing the Remaining Notes and the Credit Agreement permit, and the Indenture will permit, these subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

If any subsidiary guarantee is released, no holder of the Notes offered hereby will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be effectively senior to the claim of any holders of the Notes offered hereby.

Such change of control event may also require an offer to purchase all of our outstanding Remaining Notes pursuant to the indentures governing such notes. Additionally, under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, certain change of control events (as defined therein) constitute an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the credit agreement and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of funds for any purchase of the Notes offered hereby and the Remaining Notes and repayment of borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes offered hereby upon a Change of Control Triggering Event because it may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a Change of Control Triggering Event and repay our other indebtedness that will become due at such time. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, the Issuer’s ability to repurchase the Notes offered hereby may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes offered hereby and events of default and potential breaches of the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, some important corporate events, such as a leveraged recapitalization or a sale of our company to a public company that does not have a majority shareholder, may not, under the Indenture and the instruments governing our other indebtedness, constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes offered hereby, even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the Notes offered hereby. The occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a “change of control” will not give rise to a Change of Control Triggering Event unless, in connection with the applicable change of control, the rating assigned to the Notes by any two of Fitch, Moody’s and S&P is downgraded from the rating in effect immediately prior to the announcement of such change of control or withdrawn within 60 days of such change of control.

Under bankruptcy laws and fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and other similar laws in applicable foreign jurisdictions, the Notes offered hereby or the guarantees thereof could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued the Notes offered hereby and/or incurred the guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Notes offered hereby and/or incurring the guarantees and, in the case of (b) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: - we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes offered hereby or the incurrence of the guarantees; - the issuance of the Notes offered hereby or the incurrence of the guarantees left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business; ----- - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or the guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or - we or any of the guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us or the guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes offered hereby. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the Notes offered hereby or the guarantees would be subordinated to our or any of our guarantors’ other debt. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes offered hereby or the incurrence of a guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee, could subordinate the Notes offered hereby or that guarantee obligation to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes offered hereby to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes offered hereby. Further, the avoidance of the Notes offered hereby or the guarantees thereof could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes offered hereby or the guarantees thereof to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1) the holder of the Notes offered hereby or the guarantees thereof engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the Notes and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the bankruptcy code.

The insolvency laws of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding.

Your rights under the Notes offered hereby and the guarantees will therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to enforce effectively your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings.

See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees.” Further, under certain circumstances, a court under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes or other applicable laws could void the obligations under a guarantee or subordinate the guarantee to other obligations of the guarantor provider. See “—Fraudulent transfer laws, and similar laws in applicable foreign jurisdictions, may permit a court to void the Notes offered hereby and/or the guarantees and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payment on the Notes offered hereby.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” As a result, an entity’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee granted by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests or where the burden of that guarantee exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a creditor of an entity or the insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of an entity may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or voided.

For purposes of this description, the       % Senior Unsecured Notes due 2031 are referred to as the “Notes.” The Notes are to be issued under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Guarantors and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). Copies of the Indenture (and any supplemental indenture) may be obtained from the Issuer upon request after the Issue Date. The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes.

The Indenture will permit the Issuer to designate the maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of Additional Notes, which may differ from the maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions applicable to the Notes issued on the Issue Date. Additional Notes that differ with respect to maturity date, interest rate or optional redemption provisions from the Notes issued on the Issue Date will constitute a different series of notes from the Notes issued on the Issue Date. Additional Notes that have the same maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions as the Notes issued on the Issue Date will be treated as the same series as the Notes issued on the Issue Date, unless otherwise designated by the Issuer. The Issuer similarly will be entitled to vary the application of certain other provisions to any series of Additional Notes.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by the Issuer or portions thereof validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the registrar for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the registrar stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. This Change of Control Triggering Event purchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Senior Credit Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. In the event a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders or investors to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings or securities that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings or securities, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the Senior Credit Agreement and may require the Issuer and Axalta Coating Systems, LLC(“ACS, LLC”) to offer to repurchase the Existing 2027 Notes pursuant to the Existing 2027 Notes Indenture and ACS, LLC to offer to repurchase the Existing 2029 Notes pursuant to the Existing 2029 Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer may also contain prohibitions on certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. If the Issuer experiences a Change of Control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Agreement, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement being declared due and payable. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such senior Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on the Issuer. ----- The Existing 2027 Notes Indenture requires the Issuer and ACS, LLC to make an offer to purchase the Existing 2027 Notes and the Existing 2029 Notes Indenture requires ACS, LLC to make an offer to purchase the Existing 2029 Notes, in each case, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control that is accompanied by certain changes in ratings assigned to the Existing 2027 Notes or the Existing 2029 Notes, as applicable, by each of Moody’s and S&P (or any successor ratings agency thereto). The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by the Issuer’s then-existing financial resources. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required purchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes offered hereby upon a change of control.” The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person. Although there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to purchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Holders of the Notes offered hereby may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the Notes offered hereby repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.” The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of Control” or “Change of Control Triggering Event,” may be waived or modified at any time (including after a Change of Control Triggering Event) with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

For purposes of clauses (12) and (13) above, taxes and Related Taxes shall include all interest and penalties with respect thereto and all additions thereto. ----- As of the Issue Date, all of the Parent Guarantor’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. The Parent Guarantor will not permit (i) any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary, in each case except pursuant to the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will only be permitted if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants set forth in the Indenture. For purposes of the covenant described above, if any Investment or Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) would be permitted pursuant to one or more provisions described above and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments,” the Parent Guarantor may divide and classify such Investment or Restricted Payment (or a portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant and may later divide and reclassify any such Investment or Restricted Payment so long as the Investment or Restricted Payment (as so divided and/or reclassified) would be permitted to be made in reliance on the applicable exception as of the date of such reclassification. As set forth in clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant, our ability to make Restricted Payments depends in part on a calculation based on the Consolidated Net Income of the Parent Guarantor since January 1, 2013. As of June 30, 2023, we estimate that clause (c) of the first paragraph of this covenant provides us with Restricted Payments capacity thereunder of approximately $1.1 billion.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $100.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100.0% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100.0% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to (but not including) the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within ten Business Days after the date that such Excess Proceeds exceed $100.0 million by transmitting electronically or by mailing to the holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to such Excess Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds at any time prior to the expiration of the application period or by electing to make an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds before the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $100.0 million. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained _Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered by holders thereof ----- exceeds the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Trustee shall select the Notes (and the Issuer or its agents shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent the Excess Proceeds exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (and, if required by the terms thereof, all Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuer need only make an Asset Sale Offer up to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes (and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness), and any additional Excess Proceeds shall not be subject to this covenant and shall be permitted to be used for any purpose in the Issuer’s discretion. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified at any time with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. The Senior Credit Agreement prohibits or limits, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer or one of its Affiliates could seek the consent of their lenders or investors to the purchase of the Notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer or one of its Affiliates does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuer is required to purchase, selection of such Notes for purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed (so long as the Paying Agent knows of such listing) or if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer (with adjustments so that only Notes in denominations of the minimum denomination of $150,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof shall be purchased) by lot or by such other method as the Paying Agent shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements and the procedures of DTC); provided that the selection of Notes for purchase shall not result in a holder with a principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination of $150,000. No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the minimum denomination of such Note would be left outstanding. Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or sent electronically, at least ten days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with DTC procedures. If any Note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any Note (other than a global note) purchased in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the Note. On and after the purchase date, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof purchased. In the event of an Asset Sale in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture as a result of which the Issuer is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor, upon completion of such Asset Sale, an entity that is organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, Canada, any province thereof or any territory thereof, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, any other member of the European Union (as it is constituted on the Issue Date) or the United Kingdom, England and Wales, or Bermuda shall become an obligor of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

Any person who requests or accesses such financial information or seeks to participate in any conference calls required by this covenant will be required to provide its email address, employer name and other information reasonably requested by the Issuer and represent to the Issuer (to the Issuer’s reasonable good faith satisfaction) that: (1) it is a holder of the Notes, a beneficial owner of the Notes, a bona fide prospective investor in the Notes, a bona fide market maker in the Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser or a bona fide securities analyst providing an analysis of investment in the Notes; (2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations; (3) it will keep such provided information confidential and will not communicate the information to any Person; and (4) it (a) will not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries and (b) is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is principally engaged in a Similar Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenues from operating or owning a Similar Business.

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from at least two Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default (other than any Default that would not constitute a Default following a Covenant Suspension Event (as defined below)) has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), (x) the Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged as described under “—Guarantees” and (y) the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants or provisions (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”): (1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; (2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”; (3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”; (4) “—Asset Sales”; (5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”; (6) upon the making of the election described under the second paragraph under “—Liens,” the first paragraph under “— Liens;” (7) “—Future Guarantors”; and (8) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.” In the event that the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) due to the withdrawal of an Investment Grade Rating or the downgrade of the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating from two of the Rating Agencies, then the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events. The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds (as defined below) ----- from Net Cash Proceeds shall be reset at zero. With respect to Restricted Payments made after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. No Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary during the Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such covenant were in effect during such period. In addition, all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred or issued pursuant to clause (c)(i) of the definition of “Permitted Debt.” In addition, (i) for purposes of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements entered into by the Parent Guarantor and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of the Parent Guarantor during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph of “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (ii) for purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries” and (iii) for purposes of the covenant described under “— Liens,” any Lien incurred during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered into pursuant to clause (7) of the definition of Permitted Liens. In addition, during the Suspension Period, the Guarantees granted by Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor will be automatically released and the obligation to grant further Guarantees will be suspended. Upon the Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described under “—Future Guarantors” will be reinstated (and the Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date on which any guaranteed Indebtedness was Incurred for purposes of the covenant described under “—Future Guarantors”). During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definitions of “Permitted Liens” or “Unrestricted Subsidiary” to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or any provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant had remained in effect since the Issue Date and during the Suspension Period. Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension Period and the Parent Guarantor and any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or breach of any of the Suspended Covenants (notwithstanding the reinstatement thereof) under the Indenture, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations entered into during a Suspension Period following a Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; provided that, to the extent any such commitment or obligation results in the making of a Restricted Payment, such Restricted Payment shall be made under clause (c) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and if not permitted by any of such provisions, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed permitted under clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and shall be deducted for purposes of calculating the amount pursuant to such clause (c) such that the amount available under such clause (c) immediately following such Restricted Payment shall be zero. We cannot assure you that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if such events have occurred, (ii) make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken during the Suspension Period on the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ future compliance with their covenants or (iii) notify the holders of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a default under clause (3) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of outstanding Notes notify the Issuer in writing of the default and such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of the first paragraph above after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of an Event of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders, more than two years prior to such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest, on all Notes to be due and payable; _provided that a notice of an Event of Default may not be given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to holders,_ more than two years prior to such notice. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences. Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each a “Directing _Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such holder delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder_ is not (or, in the case such holder is DTC or its nominee, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) ----- Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default, shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such holder’s Position Representation within five Business Days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (except for any indemnity which may have been provided to the Trustee), with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received the Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank and (ii) the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. The Trustee shall not have any liability to the Issuer, any holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes, waive, rescind or cancel any declaration of an existing or past Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture if such waiver, rescission or cancellation would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or the principal of, the Notes (other than such nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due as a result of such acceleration). Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, if prior to 20 days after such Event of Default arose, the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the requisite amount of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has otherwise been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; ----- (3) such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it in respect of any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security or indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action, and shall be entitled to rely on, and not liable for any action taken or omitted pursuant to, the advice of legal counsel acceptable to the Trustee. The Trustee may act through attorneys or agents but will not be liable or responsible for the acts or omissions of any such attorney or agent appointed with due care. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must deliver to each holder of the Notes notice of the Default within 90 days after it is known to the Trustee (unless such Default is cured or waived prior to delivery thereof). The Trustee shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until a responsible officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge thereof. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon any Officer of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer also is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after such Officer becoming aware of such Default or Event of Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day (or 180-day if with respect to a Default under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information”) time period), an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuer is taking or propose to take with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.1,European Union,326.1.1,,"Several of the guarantors are organized under the laws of member states of the European Union (“Member States” and “EU,” respectively). Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings, recast, as amended (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”) applies to insolvencies which commence after 26 June 2017, subject to certain exceptions (it does not apply to (a) insurance undertakings, (b) credit institutions, (c) investment firms and other firms, institutions and undertakings to the extent covered by the Bank Insolvency Directive (Directive 2001/24/EC), and (d) collective investment undertakings). Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”). Article 3(1) defines COMI as the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties. The ultimate determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing or conflicting views. COMI is determined at the time the request to open the relevant insolvency proceedings is made (where a court is involved). The term COMI is not a static, but rather a facts and circumstances based concept and may hence change from time to time. In the case of a company or legal person, the COMI is presumed to be located in the country of its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the threemonth period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. The European Court of Justice has ruled that a debtor company’s COMI must be determined by attaching greater importance to the company’s central administration, as may be established by objective factors which are ascertainable by third-parties. Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its registered office and the management decisions of the company are taken in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, in that place, the presumption that the company’s COMI is located in that place, shall be irrebuttable. Where a company’s central administration is, however, not in the same place as its registered office, the presence of company assets and existence of contracts for the financial exploitation of those assets in a Member State other than that in which the registered office is situated cannot be regarded as sufficient factors to rebut the abovementioned presumption, unless a comprehensive assessment of all relevant factors makes it possible to establish, in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. The factors to be taken into account include, in particular, all the places in which it holds assets, in so far as they are ascertainable by third-parties. The Recast Insolvency Regulation also sets out, at paragraph 30 of the Preamble, examples of where a presumption as to a company’s “centre of main interests” may be rebutted. The Recast Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation by reference to each applicable Member State. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. If the COMI of a company is and remains located in a Member State (other than Denmark), main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the Recast Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. The effects of those main proceedings, however, do not affect third party rights in rem situated in a territory of another Member State in accordance with Article 8 of Recast Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, if the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ----- secondary and “territorial” proceedings (sometimes referred to as “secondary” insolvency proceedings) only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. The effects of secondary and territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company which are situated in such other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the Recast Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in which the company has its COMI have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only be opened in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions (including rights _in rem, creditor set-off, reservation of title proceedings, immovable property and employment contracts), be governed by the lex fori concursus, that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening main proceedings and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been opened there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g. the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State nor has any preservation measure to the contrary been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets). In order to avoid the opening of secondary proceedings, the insolvency practitioner in the main proceedings may also give a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary proceedings could be opened that, when distributing assets or realization proceeds, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary proceedings were opened in that Member State. This, however, is subject to a “qualified majority” (as defined under national law) of known local creditors (being creditors whose claims against a debtor arose from or in connection with the operation of an establishment situated in a Member State other than the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is located) approving the undertaking. The law applicable to the distribution of proceeds and ranking of claims is also the law of the Member State where secondary proceedings are opened. Additionally, under Article 38 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan, however, is voluntary. The European Commission may, from time to time, publish amendments to the EU Insolvency Regulation which, once enacted, might alter the manner in which the test for determining where a company has its “centre of main interests” might be applied during the term of the Notes. In the event that any guarantor organized under the laws of a Member State experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the relevant guarantor or any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate ----- may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied in relation to one another.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of the Belgian Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. Such proceedings would then be governed by Belgian law. Under certain circumstances, Belgian law also allows bankruptcy proceedings to be opened in Belgium over the assets of companies that are not established under Belgian law. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law: Belgian insolvency laws provide for two primary insolvency procedures: a judicial restructuring proceedings (gerechtelijke _reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and a liquidation proceedings (overdracht onder gerechtelijk gezag/transfert sous autorité judiciaire and faillissement/faillite)._",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.2,Belgium,326.2.2,Judicial Restructuring,"A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may file a petition for judicial restructuring if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. If the net assets of the debtor have fallen below 50% of the debtor’s issued capital, the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. As from the filing of the petition with the competent commercial court overseeing the judicial restructuring and for as long as such court has not issued a judgment thereon, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt or wound up by court order. In addition, during this period, none of the debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets. Within a period of 14 days as from the filing of the petition and subject to the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court may decide to open the judicial restructuring procedure, thereby granting a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of four months. At the request of the debtor and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended (once or several times) up to a total maximum period of twelve months as from the judgment opening the judicial restructuring. The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with limited exceptions. During the duration of the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to preexisting claims. Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial restructuring retain their conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. In principle a pledge on receivables will not be affected by the moratorium if the receivables were pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial restructuring proceedings and provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment the pledge is created. Although challenged in certain case law, the pledgee is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (e.g., the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. Notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on accounts in the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of 15 December 2004 can be enforced, subject to limited exceptions. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co-debtors. The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise. However, in respect of an enforcement over pledged cash falling within the scope of the Financial Collateral Act of 15 December 2004, the enforcement prohibition applies, with limited exceptions (notably in the event of a payment default), if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of 15 December 2004 or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but the creditor is not such an entity. During the judicial restructuring procedure, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to exercise their management functions. However, upon request of the debtor or any other interested party and to the extent it is deemed useful for reaching the aims of the restructuring, the court may appoint, in its decision to open the judicial restructuring procedure or at any other point in time during the course of the procedure, a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) to assist the debtor during the restructuring. The court may also appoint a judicial administrator, upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings or bad faith of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies, to either exercise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of ----- its corporate bodies for the duration of the moratorium. In addition, in the event of manifestly gross error or manifest bad faith, a court appointed temporary director (voorlopig bestuurder/administrateur provisoire) may be appointed. The restructuring procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the initiation of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a restructuring procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but the creditor is not such an entity. The Belgian law on judicial restructuring provides that a creditor may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the restructuring procedure if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default. As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during the restructuring procedure, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor, and that such default is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the enterprise or its assets. The exercise of this right, however, does not prevent the creditor from suspending in turn the performance of its own obligations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.2,Belgium,326.2.3,Private or Public Judicial Restructuring by Amicable Settlement or Collective Agreement,"The Belgian law of 1[st] September 2023 has introduced both private and public alternatives for reorganization proceedings through amicable settlement and the collective agreement. The key distinction between these types lies in the level of confidentiality maintained throughout the proceedings. The treatment of claims remains consistent in both private and public forms of reorganization proceedings, whether they are structured as amicable or collective agreements. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the court and all parties involved. A judicial restructuring procedure may result in an amicable settlement between the debtor and one or more of its creditors, or a collective agreement which involves all creditors. In the case of an amicable settlement, the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the terms they have agreed to. In the case of a judicial restructuring by collective agreement, all creditors vote on a restructuring plan. The plan must be filed with the online register Regsol at least 15 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the restructuring plan. The court needs to ratify the restructuring plan prior to its taking effect. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The vote on the restructuring plan depends on the type of company. Either the company is qualified as an SME, or the company is a large enterprise. If the company is an SME, the restructuring plan is approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court. The plan will bind all creditors, including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not (the measures which can be imposed on creditors holding security rights are limited, however, to suspension of their claims). In this type of vote, a secured creditor may not be crammed down pursuant to a restructuring plan. However, the claim of a secure creditor may be crammed down to the extent its claim exceeds (i) the amount recorded in the applicable register in case of registered security, (ii) the book value of pledged receivables or (iii) in respect of other security, the going concern value of the secured assets. Consequently, the amounts secured by the mortgage mandates and the business pledge mandates will not be taken into account when determining which part of the secured claim is protected against a cram down and a creditor benefiting from a mortgage mandate or business pledge mandate is not protected against cram down under such a mortgage mandate or business pledge mandate. The court may refuse ratification if the conditions of the judicial restructuring act were not met, or if the proposed restructuring plan violates public policy. If the company is a large company, other rules regarding the vote of the creditors apply and a secured claim could be crammed down pursuant to a restructuring plan. First, creditors are divided into classes. Within the same class, creditors must have a comparable position. The law stipulates that there must be at least two classes: extraordinary creditors and ordinary creditors. The reorganization plan is deemed to be approved by a class of creditors if creditors representing half of the claims in principal and interest approve it. The number of creditors voting in favor of the plan is therefore irrelevant; it is the amount of the claims that is taken into consideration. The claims and interests of those who do not take part in the vote are not taken into account. The law includes a provision for a “cram down” on dissenting classes of creditors. In cases where one or more classes of creditors do not approve the reorganization plan, the court has the authority to bypass these negative votes and proceed with plan approval, subject to certain additional conditions. Firstly, the law mandates that the plan must secure approval from a majority of the classes, including at least one “superior” class of creditors voting in favor of the plan. Furthermore, the court can grant approval to the plan and disregard ----- the objections of a class of creditors, provided that it verifies that the plan satisfies the creditors’ best interest test. This test is considered satisfied when no dissenting creditor is in a worse financial position than they would be under regular liquidation proceedings. Following the judgment opening the judicial restructuring proceedings, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the amount of its claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor up to one month before the ratification hearing of the court. The court can determine the disputed amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the restructuring procedure, or definitively, on the condition that it has jurisdiction in that respect, but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be taken in a sufficiently short time frame. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim, the amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan. The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a restructuring plan, with the assistance of the court-appointed administrator, as the case may be.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.2,Belgium,326.2.4,"Liquidation Proceedings: Pre-pack, Transfer of Undertaking and Bankruptcy","The debtor can request the transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise to the court. It can also be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific circumstances. The transfer can be organized under the form of a pre-pack (negotiations remain confidential and formal proceedings is open for the transfer itself) or formal proceedings is opened, an auction is organized and a court practitioner is appointed. Following the transfer, the recourse of the creditors will in most cases be limited to the transfer price. A bankruptcy procedure may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors or upon the initiative of the Public Prosecutor’s office, or the provisional administrator of the merchant’s assets or the liquidator of ‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ opened in another EU member state (except Denmark) according to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Conditions for a bankruptcy order (d´eclaration de faillite/aangifte van faillissement) are that the debtor must be in a situation of cessation of payments (cessation de paiements/staking van betaling) and be unable to obtain further credit (´ebranlement de cr´edit/wiens krediet geschokt is). Cessation of payments is generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay its debts as they fall due. Such situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curateur/curator) becomes responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver. The receiver must decide whether or not to temporarily continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may decide to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: (a) the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an automatic early termination or acceleration event; and (b) intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment, since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy if such decision is necessary for the management and liquidation of the bankrupt estate. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy (and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors) and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive relief or require specific performance of the contract. The enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited to the period required for the first report of verification of the claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific order of the court, which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors but without prejudicing the secured creditors, and provided that those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, such suspension does not apply to a pledge of financial instruments or cash held on account. For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A firstranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the first report of claims has been ----- finalized; the court may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee, provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security. The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following is a general view of such rules: (a) Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the so-called ‘‘estate debts,’’ have a senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors; (b) Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization); (c) Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the debtor; and (d) Pari passu: Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be subordinated).",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis and consideration has to be given to any direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would derive from the transaction. Two principles apply to such evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the company in issuing the guarantee must be proportional to the direct and/or indirect benefit derived from the transaction and (ii) the financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial capabilities. If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable (i) by the company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort. Moreover, the guarantee or collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee or collateral could be held liable for up to the amount of the guarantee. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit, or the creditor may be held liable for any guarantee amount in excess of such amount. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue. In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Indenture will contain such limitation language and the security and the guarantees of the Belgian Guarantors will be so limited. The Indenture will expressly provide, substantially to the effect that, the obligations of the Belgian Guarantor under the guarantee clause of the Indenture: (a) shall not include any liability which would constitute unlawful financial assistance (as determined in article 5:152/6:118/7:227 of the Belgian Company and Associations Code); and (b) shall be limited, at any time to an amount equal to the greater of: (a) an amount equal to 85% of the Net Assets of that Belgian Guarantor calculated on the basis of its latest available annual financial statements at the date of this Indenture, (b) an amount equal to 85% of the Net Assets of that Belgian Guarantor calculated on the basis of its latest available annual financial statements at the date on which a demand is made against it under the Guarantee, where “Net Assets” means, irrespective of the corporate form of the relevant Belgian Guarantor, the net assets of the Belgian Guarantor as calculated in accordance with Article 5:142 paragraph 3 or Article 7:212 paragraph 2 (as applicable) of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code and, in the event of a dispute on the amount thereof, a certificate of such amount from the statutory auditor of that Belgian Guarantor (or, if no statutory auditor is appointed or the statutory auditor refuses to issue such certificate, from an accountant appointed upon the Administrative Agent’s request by the “Insituut van de Bedrijfsrevisoren/ Institut des Réviseurs d’Entreprises”) shall be conclusive, save in the case of manifest error, and (c) the aggregate of all proceeds from the offering of the Notes which the Issuer has applied for the direct or indirect benefit of each Belgian Guarantor directly or indirectly under intercompany loan agreements and outstanding at the date a payment is to be made by such Belgian Guarantor under the Guarantee, it being specified that any payment made by a Belgian Guarantor under this Article X ----- in respect of the obligations of the Issuer shall reduce _pro tanto_ the outstanding amount due by such Belgian Guarantor under the intercompany loan agreements referred to above and that any repayment of the intercompany loans by the Belgian Guarantor shall reduce pro tanto the amount payable under this Article X.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

In principle, a debtor is deemed to have stopped paying its debts as of the date of the bankruptcy judgment. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy judgment, except in cases where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period.” The business transactions entered into during the hardening period which will be declared ineffective against third parties include, among others, (i) transactions entered into on extremely beneficial terms, (ii) payments other than in money for debts due, and (iii) security provided for existing debt. The receiver may request the court to declare payments of a Belgian Guarantor during the hardening period for debts due ineffective against third parties, provided that it can be proven that the creditor concerned was aware of the cessation of payment of the company. Finally, regardless of any declaration by the commercial court of a hardening period, transactions of which it can be demonstrated that they have been entered into with fraudulent prejudice to third creditors may be declared ineffective against third parties.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.3,Bermuda,326.3.1,Procedure for a Court Ordered Winding Up,"There are two types of insolvent liquidations in Bermuda—voluntary and compulsory. The former is usually referred to as a “creditors voluntary” (“CVL”) and is begun by the company itself passing a resolution in general meeting. A full description of the CVL procedure appears in the next section of this summary. Compulsory liquidations are commenced by way of a petition presented to the Supreme Court in Bermuda upon which the Court will be asked to make a winding up order. There are a number of circumstances in which a company may be wound up by the Court (S.161), the most common of which is when the company is insolvent (S.161 (e)). It is also possible for the company, in general meeting, to resolve to petition to wind itself up under this procedure. In that case the petition is presented by the company. In the case of insolvency, the petition can be presented by either the company, a creditor or contributory member (although this is limited to situations where the member continues to have an economic interest, e.g. they are liable to contribute in the event of a liquidation or the company may be solvent and capable of paying members). For the purpose of this section, creditor includes a contingent or prospective creditor (S.163). The petitioner must show that the company is insolvent. The Registrar of Companies (the “Registrar”) may also present a petition in circumstances where it would be just and equitable to wind up the company. Although the Act applies to insurance companies, there are additional special provisions relating to the presentation petitions in respect of insurance companies. ----- Insolvency can be proved in one of three ways: (i) commercial insolvency ‒ the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; (ii) balance sheet insolvency ‒ assets do not exceed liabilities; or (iii) deemed insolvency ‒ a statutory demand for a liquidated sum which remains unpaid, without reasonable excuse, for three weeks (S.162 (a)); and a judgment has been left unsatisfied in whole or in part (S.162(b)). The petition when presented must be verified by an affidavit. The date of the hearing of the petition must be advertised, and before an order is made the Court, through the Registrar, must be satisfied that the procedural requirements relating to service and advertising have been complied with. Any creditor or contributory can appear on the day of the hearing of the petition provided that they have filed prior notice of their intention to do so, and in the event that they wish to contest the petition, have filed affidavit evidence prior to the hearing setting out the basis of their objection to an order being made. Upon the making of a winding up order, or upon the appointment of a provisional liquidator, no actions may be commenced or continued against the company without leave of the Court and the rights and duties of the directors cease. This automatic stay does not extend beyond Bermuda and if there are proceedings against the company in a jurisdiction outside Bermuda, relief in that jurisdiction would need to be sought to obtain a stay. The liquidator is required to collect in the assets and distribute them pari passu amongst unsecured creditors. The steps to be undertaken in this procedure include the following: - calling for a statement of affairs to be prepared by the company’s former officers/directors which sets out the financial position of the company; and - calling the first meetings of creditors and contributories. This is required to be done within a month of the winding up order, but further time can be obtained by application to the Court. The purpose of the meetings is to appoint liquidator(s) and, if desired by creditors, a committee of inspection. The committee acts as an advisory “board” to the liquidator and can sanction certain of the liquidators’ actions which would otherwise need to be sanctioned by the Court. In the event that the creditors and contributories cannot agree on the nomination of a liquidator, the Court will decide which candidate to appoint. In any event the appointment of the liquidator and the committee must be made by the court following the first meetings. For the purpose of voting at the first meeting proofs of debt will be called for, but a creditor can only vote in respect of that portion of its claim that is liquidated. Secured creditors may realize their security outside the estate; accounting to the liquidator for any excess or filing a proof of claim as an unsecured creditor for any shortfall. These are preferential creditors: - employees working in Bermuda are entitled to their full contractual rights on termination (Employment Act 2000); - employees employed outside of Bermuda (maximum of $2,500 per employee); and - the government of Bermuda with respect to certain taxes, etc. (S.236) which will be paid in full prior to the distribution to unsecured creditors. Expenses of the liquidation will be deducted from the available funds prior to the payment of any preferential creditors (Rule 140). The liquidator will call for proofs of claim from creditors and adjudicate each claim to determine if it is valid. Once this process has been completed, he will make a dividend distribution to all unsecured creditors pari passu. That is, in its simplest form, the process. The liquidator’s general powers are set out in s.175. However, there are a number of matters which may also arise or require to be investigated by the liquidator as follows: - the liquidator is entitled to the entirety of the books and records and property of the company (s.186) and to aid him in this can apply to court to examine on oath anyone suspected of having property or information (s.195); - no proceedings can be commenced or continued against the company once an order has been made or liquidator appointed (s.167); - any dispositions of the company’s property or transfer of shares are void if carried out following the presentation of the Petition without a court order (s.166); ----- - transactions involving payments to creditors within 6 months prior to the Petition being presented may be set aside if made with the dominant intention of preferring those creditors over others (s.237); - directors and officers may be liable for debts of the company personally if it is determined that they carried on the business of the company knowing it was insolvent and with the intent to defraud creditors (s.246); and - the liquidator has the power to investigate the affairs of the company and to determine and, if felt necessary, take action against directors for breach of duty (Directors duties are set out in s.97). Under the provisions of the Conveyancing Act 1983, as amended, certain dispositions of a company’s property are voidable if the (i) disposition was made with the dominant purpose of putting the property out of the reach of creditors and (ii) an obligation to the person seeking to set the disposition aside existed at the time of the disposition or was reasonably foreseeable at that time or arises within 2 years of that date. The limitation period on such dispositions is six years from the transfer, or, if later, from the time when the obligation arose or cause of action accrued. Any floating charge made within 12 months immediately preceding presentation of the petition shall be invalid unless (a) the company was solvent at the time of creation or (b) the charge was in respect of monies advanced specifically at the time the security was given (s.239). The liquidator has the right to apply to the Court to disclaim a contract which he considers onerous on the company or which is unprofitable or unsaleable (s.240). Set-off in respect of debts is permissible provided there exists mutuality and the sum in question is a debt as at the date of liquidation. There are of course numerous other procedural requirements involved in the process of winding up prior to, during and at the completion of the liquidation. Accounts are required to be filed, books kept and rules relating to proofs of debt followed. The interpretation of the various sections listed above has been developed over the years in case law in the United Kingdom (from which country most of the law is derived).",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

The directors of the company meet prior to the meetings of the shareholders and of the creditors to: - authorise the convening of the meetings and the resolution to be put on behalf of the board; - consider and approve the statement of affairs and list of creditors; and - appoint one of the directors to preside at the creditors meeting. Notice must be given of a Special General Meeting of members to: - wind up the company voluntarily; - appoint a liquidator; and - appoint up to 5 nominees to the committee of inspection. Notice must be given of a meeting of creditors to be held on the same day or the day after the members meeting (general and special proxies should be enclosed with the notice of the meeting). Notice of the meeting of creditors will be dependent upon the requirement for notice of shareholders meetings as set out in the company’s bye-laws. Notice of the creditors’ meeting must be published in the Official Gazette on two occasions prior to the meeting. Notice of members’ meeting and of the creditors’ meeting is usually sent out on the same day. The Special General Meeting must be held and the relevant resolutions passed. ----- The creditors’ meeting must be held. Either a general or special proxy must be received by 4:00 p.m. on the day preceding the creditors’ meeting in order to be valid for the purposes of the creditors’ meeting. It is not necessary for a proof of debt to be lodged with the company prior to the creditors’ meeting. The Chairman will, for voting purposes, use the value shown in the statement of affairs. If a proxy holder, a liquidator cannot vote for his own appointment as liquidator. The purpose of the creditors’ meeting is to receive the statement of affairs and list of creditors and, if wished, to appoint a liquidator and committee of inspection. The quorum is three creditors present or represented, or all of the creditors, if there are less than three. A resolution of the creditors is passed when approved by a majority in number and value of those voting personally or by proxy. If the creditors do not nominate a liquidator, either because they decline to do so or because they cannot agree who should be nominated, then the company’s nominee becomes liquidator. If the creditors nominate someone other than the person chosen by the company any director, member or creditor can apply to the Court, within seven days, to have the company’s nominee or some other person appointed in place of, or jointly with, the creditors’ nominee. A committee of inspection consisting of a maximum of five persons may be appointed by the creditors. This committee is a representative body to assist and supervise the liquidator. The members at their earlier meeting, or at a subsequent meeting, can nominate up to five persons to act as members of the committee. The creditors may also appoint up to five persons to the committee; however, the creditors may decide, which, if any, of the members’ nominees shall serve on the committee. Liquidator’s fees are fixed by this committee, or, if there is no such committee, then by the creditors at a later meeting. Notices relating to the winding up of the company, the appointment of the liquidator and formal notice to claim are advertised in the Official Gazette and filed with the Registrar. The liquidator will take into custody the company’s seal, papers, books, documents and other property and a statement to the effect that the company is in liquidation should appear on all letters, invoices, orders etc. The liquidator will write to creditors asking them to submit details of claims and will enclose a formal notice to claim (giving a minimum of 14 days notice). This notice of claim is the same as that which is advertised in the Official Gazette. The liquidator must then examine every proof and claim to priority that he receives and omit or reject it in writing or require further evidence. If he rejects a proof he must state his grounds in writing to the creditor. The liquidator realises any assets and makes calls, if any, on any members liable to contribute and pays liabilities in due order. During this time the liquidator will call meetings of the committee of inspection (if a committee was appointed) when required. In the event that the winding up continues for more than one year the liquidator summons a general meeting of the company and a meeting of the creditors at the end of the first year from the commencement of the winding up, and of each succeeding year, or at the first convenient date within three months from the end of the year (or such longer period as the Registrar may allow), and shall lay before the meetings an account of his acts and dealings and of the conduct of the winding up during the preceding year. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound up the liquidator will prepare an account of the winding up showing how the winding up has been conducted and how the property of the company has been disposed of. Thereupon he will call a general meeting of the company and a meeting of the creditors for the purpose of laying the account before the meetings and giving an explanation thereof. Each meeting will be called by advertisement in an appointed newspaper specifying the time, place and object thereof published at least one month before the meeting (in addition to notices and proxies being sent out to members and creditors). At the creditors’ meeting a resolution is passed relating to the disposal of the company’s books and records. The liquidator files relevant documentation with the Registrar within one week of the date of the meetings and on the expiration of three (3) months from the registration thereof the company will be deemed dissolved.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

In the event of an insolvency of the Canadian guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Canada in respect of such Canadian guarantor, which proceedings would be governed by Canadian insolvency laws. In such circumstances, the guarantee obligations of the Canadian guarantor may become subject to review under applicable Canadian insolvency laws and applicable provincial laws on fraudulent ----- conveyance. Pursuant to such laws, a Canadian court could void the obligations under the relevant guarantee if, among other things, the Canadian guarantor, at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee: - issued the guarantee with the intention to delay, hinder, defeat or defraud creditors, noting however that if such occurs in the context of a related party transaction, the intention may be, in certain circumstances, by statute, inferred or not be a necessary element; - received less than fair market value for issuing the guarantee at the time it issued the guarantee; - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the guarantee; or - had the effect of giving the beneficiaries of the guarantees a preference. Under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada), the Canadian guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - it is for any reason unable to meet its obligations as they generally become due; - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become due; or - the aggregate of its property is not, at fair valuation, sufficient, or if disposed at a fairly conducted sale under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all its obligations, due and accruing due. We cannot be sure, depending on the circumstances, as to the standard that a court would use to determine whether or not a Canadian guarantor was solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that the court uses, that the issuance of the guarantee would not be voided or the guarantee would not be subordinated to the Canadian guarantor’s other debt. If such a case were to occur, the guarantee could also be subject to the claim that the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the relevant Canadian guarantor and that, as a result, the obligations of the relevant Canadian guarantor were incurred for less than fair consideration. In the context of insolvency proceedings commenced pursuant to Canadian federal bankruptcy and insolvency laws (the ‘‘Insolvency Proceedings’’), creditors may be stayed from claiming against a debtor company any pre-filing debt or obligations, unless such stay is lifted by the court supervising the relevant Insolvency Proceedings. If a Canadian court were to find that the incurrence of a guarantee was a transfer at undervalue, preference or other similar voidable transaction, the Canadian court could, among other things, have the guarantee set aside or voided. In the event of a finding that a transfer at undervalue or similar voidable transaction has occurred, holders of the Notes offered hereby may not receive any repayment on the Notes offered hereby. Further, the voidance of the Notes offered hereby could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt. In addition to the foregoing, it should be noted that under Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency statutes, a court may grant an order authorizing interim financing secured by a court-ordered charge that may rank in priority to the claim of any other creditor of the debtor. In such a circumstance, the court must consider a number of factors, including: - the period during which the debtor is expected to be subject to the Insolvency Proceedings; - how the debtor’s business and financial affairs are to be managed during the Insolvency Proceedings; - whether the debtor’s management has the confidence of its major creditors; - whether the interim financing would enhance the prospects of a viable proposal being made in respect of the debtor; - the nature and value of the debtor’s property; - whether any creditor would be materially prejudiced as a result of the security or charge; and - whether the court-appointed trustee or monitor files a report recommending the approval of the interim financing. To the extent that a Canadian court grants such interim financing secured by a court-ordered charge, the Canadian guarantor’s obligations under its guarantee of the Notes may become subordinate to its obligations pursuant to the interim financing. ----- The laws of the province of Ontario permit an action to be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction in the province of Ontario (a “Canadian Court”) to recognize and enforce a final and conclusive in personam judgment against the judgment debtor of any U.S. Court that is not impeachable as void or voidable under the applicable federal or state laws for a sum certain if, among other things: (i) the U.S. Court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction over the judgment debtor, as recognized by a Canadian Court (and submission in the indenture to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of a U.S. Court will be sufficient for that purpose); (ii) such judgment was not obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to natural justice in contravention of the fundamental principles of procedure and the foreign judgment and the enforcement thereof would not be contrary to public policy (as the term is understood under the laws of the province of Ontario), or to an order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or by the Competition Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada) in respect of certain judgments referred to in these statutes; (iii) the enforcement of such judgment does not constitute, directly or indirectly, the enforcement of foreign revenue, expropriatory, penal, or other public laws; (iv) the action to enforce such judgment is commenced within applicable limitation periods; (v) such judgment has not been satisfied; and (vi) such judgment is not under appeal or there is no other subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction relating to the same cause of action. Note, however, that any action in the Canadian Court may be affected by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally.

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the transition period following the UK’s departure from the EU (the “Transition Period”) (i.e. December 31, 2020) in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, any insolvency proceeding by or against any of the English Guarantors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws. However, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where a company incorporated under English law has its COMI in a member state of the European Union, then the main insolvency proceedings for that company will, subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the EU member state in which its COMI is located and be subject to the laws of that EU member state (see “—European Union” above). In addition, the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”), which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”) in Great Britain, provide that foreign (i.e. non English) insolvency proceedings may be recognised where any English company has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where it carries out a non transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such foreign jurisdiction. In case of any conflict, the Recast Insolvency Regulation will prevail over the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. An “establishment” is defined in the same way as under the Recast Insolvency Regulation (see “—European Union” above). While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in other relevant jurisdictions (see “— Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings” below). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the guarantees. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee against an English Guarantor. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the guarantees. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Guarantor.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per Section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency” below). ----- Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company or the directors of such company may also appoint an administrator out of court. (Further, the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” which has become enforceable would also be entitled to appoint an administrator out of court; however, as no such security is being given to support the guarantees provided by the English Guarantors this will not apply to the holders of the Notes but another creditor holding such a charge could have this right.) Different appointment procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge; no such floating charge is being given at closing to support the guarantees of the Notes provided by the English Guarantors). In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed and no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realise their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”). Accordingly, if any of the English Guarantors were to enter into administration, the guarantees may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that such permission of the court or consent of the administrator would be obtained.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

An English Guarantor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign guarantor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. Once sanctioned, the scheme shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies.

Similar to a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely Part 26A thereof, which allows the English ----- courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a company and its creditors or shareholders (or any class of them), but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down to bind dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring. While this new standalone restructuring plan is generally available to the same companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members (or any class of them)for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating such financial difficulties. There is no financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner). A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a hearing. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring or compromise arrangement must be permitted to participate in a convening meeting ordered by the court. At the hearing, the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and may order “out-of-the-money” creditors and members (i.e. those shown not have a genuine economic interest in the company) not to attend future meetings. Thereafter, the court may convene further stakeholder meetings, details of which must be sent to every stakeholder in that class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. The proposed restructuring plan will be voted on at the relevant creditors’ or members’ meeting in respect of the creditors’ or members’ claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors or members which will be affected and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. The restructuring plan will be approved if the required majority of 75% by value of the creditors or members present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors or members vote in favor of it. In contrast to a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the plan. Following the creditors’ or members’ meeting(s), a sanction hearing will be held. Here, the court will consider if the necessary plan requirements have been met and decide whether to sanction the restructuring plan. The court has discretion to sanction a plan, even if one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that no creditor or member in the dissenting class(es) would be worse off than they would be in what the court considers to be the most likely alternative scenario, were the plan not sanctioned, which is known as the “relative alternative;” and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing 75% by value of a class of creditors or members who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the “relative alternative” scenario referred to in (i) above. A restructuring plan must then be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and may also review the fairness of the restructuring plan. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. If sanctioned, it will be binding on all affected parties, whether they initially voted in favor of it or not. Parties’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies.

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent. ----- In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. A simple majority of the company’s members must also have voted on the proposal. However, if the company’s creditors approve the proposal, the CVA will be implemented notwithstanding a vote against by the members. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement, however, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.5,England and Wales,326.5.6,Liquidation/Winding-Up,"Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realised and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—Priority on insolvency” below). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two latter proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months whereas the primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act – see “—Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the UK in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see “—Insolvency Law” above), members’ voluntary liquidation proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland. The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—Avoidance of Transactions” below). Any secured creditor(s) in our corporate group may also have additional remedies available to them under English law to satisfy their obligations. The exercise of such remedies may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.5,England and Wales,326.5.7,Priority on Insolvency,"One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realise the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors. In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, ----- distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness); - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit. The UK government has confirmed its intention in the Finance Bill 2020 that from 1 December 2020 secondary preferential debts will include claims by HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - _Fifth ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully repaid; and - _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. ----- An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realisations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6 April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the security and/or guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions entered into by the company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid. _Onset of Insolvency_ The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue and preferences (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question. In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. _Connected Persons_ If a given transaction at an undervalue or preference has been entered into by the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below). A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue or preferences is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons ----- or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset of the English company’s insolvency is within a period of two years from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “Connected persons” above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

It will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the English company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the English company grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction has the effect of putting a creditor of the English company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been entered into. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which entered into the transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position in relation to that person when taking their decision. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by ----- reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the English company.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.5,England and Wales,326.5.15,Limitations on Enforcement,"----- The grant of a guarantee by any of the English Guarantors in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Guarantor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Guarantor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.” The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Guarantor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company incorporated in England and Wales (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after 6 April 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. Security created on or after 1 October 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Registration with applicable asset registries may, however, still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. _Moratorium_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties, including creditors, are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “—Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering liquidation (see “— Liquidation/winding-up” above). _Enforcement of Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_ CIGA amended the Insolvency Act to introduce a permanent prohibition on the enforcement of termination clauses or taking of any other action by suppliers, automatic termination of the contract or the occurrence of any other event and the imposition of amended terms by a supplier in each case in contracts for the supply of goods and services and which would have been triggered by the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the counterparty company. Such proceedings include an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and a restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than on the counterparty’s insolvency) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. To prevent undue hardship, a supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company, the relevant insolvency practitioner or the court consents. Financial services contracts and entities involved in the provision of financial services are not affected by this new prohibition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.5,England and Wales,326.5.16,Cross-Border Recognition of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings,"----- _General Position_ The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions. One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the Model Law, which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States and Great Britain, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or nonmain proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the “Lugano Convention”) (subject to the UK’s pending application to accede to the latter) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No. 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention and the Lugano Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties. _Recognition in the EU_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognised in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognised and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result. _No Winding Up Petitions or Orders_ CIGA has temporarily suspended the ability of creditors to present a winding up petition during the period between April 27, 2020 and December 31, 2020 (subject to extension) on the basis of a company’s inability to pay its debts, unless the creditor has reasonable grounds to believe that COVID-19 did not have a financial effect on the company or that the company’s inability to pay its debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. With regards to petitions that have been presented during this period but before CIGA came into force, the court can make such order as it thinks appropriate to restore the position to what it would have been if the petition had not been presented. This could lead to the voiding of winding up orders made in respect of such petitions. ----- Similarly, no winding up orders may be made by the courts during this period on the basis of an inability to pay debts if: (i) it appears to the court that COVID-19 had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition, and (ii) the court is not satisfied that the inability to pay debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. Any winding up orders made during this period but before CIGA came into force will be void and the court can give directions to the insolvency official to restore the company to its “pre-petition” position. _Statutory Demands_ Under CIGA, as from 27 April 2020 the presentation of a winding up petition will not be permitted on the basis of a statutory demand served during the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020 (subject to extension). This applies whether or not COVID-19 had an impact on the company’s failure to discharge the demand.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.6,Germany,326.6.1,Insolvency,"Certain guarantors of the Notes are organized under the laws of Germany and have their registered office in Germany (the “German Guarantors”). Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any such guarantor, subject to the information presented under “—European Union,” insolvency proceedings may, therefore, be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would then be governed by German law. However, pursuant to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, where a German company conducts business in more than one member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the German courts may be limited if the company´s “centre of main interests” is found to be in a member state other than Germany (please see “European Union”). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the “centre of main interests,” which should correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The point of time at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the request to open insolvency proceedings is received. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Insolvency laws of jurisdictions outside the United States may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes offered hereby from recovering payments due under the Notes offered hereby.” The following is a brief high level description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany. Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately (i.e., there is generally no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. On April 21, 2017, the Bill to Facilitate the Handling of Group Insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von _Konzerninsolvenzen) entered into force. While the bill does not abolish the principle of separate insolvency proceedings in relation to_ each group entity, it provides for the following four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity’s insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan). Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a prognosis period covering the next twelve months (positive _Fortbestehensprognose). Under the Act on the Temporary Adjustment of Restructuring and Insolvency Law Provisions to Mitigate_ Crisis Effects (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden Anpassung sanierungs- und insolvenzrechtlicher Vorschriften zur Abmilderung von _Krisenfolgen) (the “SanInsKG”), the forecast period relevant for the over-indebtedness test was reduced to four months until December_ 31, 2023. However, from September 1, 2023 onwards, management may need to take into account that the reduction ceases to apply ----- within the four-month period. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder (such as, e.g., a limited partnership with a GmbH as sole general partner (GmbH & Co. KG)) becomes illiquid and/or overindebted, the management of such company and, in certain circumstances its shareholders, are obligated to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay; however, at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred or six (6) weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. Under the SanInsKG, the six-week period following the occurrence of over-indebtedness was extended to a period of eight weeks until December 31, 2023. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes, are voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obligated) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in the event of an imminent illiquidity. The formal insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings and may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), who, depending on the court decision, may have the right to manage and dispose of the business and assets of the debtor. This only applies where the debtor has not (successfully) applied for socalled self-administration (Eigenverwaltung), in which event the court will only appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger _Sachwalter), who will supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency_ court generally must set up a “preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor has satisfied as least two of the following three requirements in its previous financial year: a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted), revenues of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last balance sheet date and/or fifty or more employees on average. The requirements apply to the respective entity without taking into account the assets of other group companies. If these requirements are not met, a preliminary creditors’ committee can be established at the request of the preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or a creditor. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter and _Insolvenzverwalter), orders for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung), and appointments of preliminary trustees (Sachwalter). In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual such suggestion is binding on the court unless the suggested individual is not eligible (i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of the formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are expected not to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator _(Insolvenzverwalter) (usually, but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court, unless debtor-inpossession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered. In the absence of debtor-in-possession proceedings, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by number and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator has full power to manage the business and dispose of the debtor’s assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to manage the business or dispose of its assets. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business operations or may deem them necessary to wind down the company, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Massenschulden) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor (including secured debt insofar as the proceeds of an enforcement of relevant security are not sufficient to settle the secured claims). These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim). ----- The most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency proceedings that are subject to the German insolvency regime (against a German Guarantor or against any other guarantor having its centre of main interest in Germany and where the German insolvency courts have jurisdiction in accordance with the E.U. Insolvency Regulation or the German Insolvency Code) would be the following: - the right to administer and dispose of assets of the relevant insolvent debtor would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered; - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by management of the insolvent debtor after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by operation of law; - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the insolvent debtor´s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and - that claims against the insolvent debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte or Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the right of the insolvency administrator to elect whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law in the event insolvency proceedings are opened in Germany against the counterparty. Moreover, powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance. Any person that has a right to segregation (Aussonderung), i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for segregation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator. All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened while actions regarding preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) may be brought against the insolvency administrator. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code. Therefore, secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte), security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add-up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any) and are disbursed to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is cash remaining in the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full. Hence, the proceeds resulting from the disposal of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy the unsecured claims of the holders of the Notes. In addition, it may take several years until an insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency ----- proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return or repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the Indenture may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a “shareholder like position” (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding over the assets of a German Guarantor, the claims arising from a guarantee would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a German Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims.” Realizing the value of the insolvency estate for distribution of the proceeds among the creditors is commonly achieved by disposing of the debtor’s assets, or, as the case may be, by disposing of the debtor’s business as a going concern. It is possible to implement a debt-to-equity conversion through an insolvency plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-toequity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-to-equity conversion. If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or overindebtedness it may also file for preliminary debtor–in-possession proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren). In such a case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months if an independent expert testifies that the restructuring of the debtor’s business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos) and that the debtor is not already illiquid. During such period, the debtor shall, together with its creditors and a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter), prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be implemented in formal debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened. By submitting the insolvency plan itself the debtor may prevent a debt-to-equity conversion.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.6,Germany,326.6.2,Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer,"In insolvency proceedings governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, any security interests granted as well as the guarantee provided could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) as amended by the Act for the improvement of legal certainty concerning avoidance claims pursuant to the German Insolvency Code and the German Code on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der _Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz vom 29. März 2017) that came into force on_ April 5, 2017. Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may avoid (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during applicable avoidance periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully avoided by the insolvency administrator, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. Such transactions can include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest. The administrator’s right to avoid transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the 10-year period prior to the filing of petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event such a transaction is successfully avoided, the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received or to waive the guarantee. In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided according to the German Insolvency Code in the following cases: - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt (Befriedigung) can be avoided if the act was performed (i) in the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)at the time when such act was taken and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity (or of the circumstances that unmistakably suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) if such act was performed after the filing of a petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor had knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor or of the filing of such petition (or of circumstances unmistakably suggesting such illiquidity or filing); - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction if (i) such act was performed during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was performed during the ----- second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that unmistakably suggest such detrimental effects); - any legal transaction effected by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if (i) it was entered into during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) it was entered after such filing and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge thereof of either the debtor´s illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction; - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (for example, whereby a debtor grants security for a third-party debt), which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the debtor; - any act performed by the debtor in the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings with the intent (known to the beneficiary of the act at the time of such act) to prejudice its creditors; if the relevant act consisted of a settlement of an obligation or the grant of a security to the counterparty, the relevant period is four years instead of ten years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time; - any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) entered into by the debtor in the last two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings with a closely related party (which term includes in particular the management, supervisory board members and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, certain persons with comparable access to information about the debtor, and certain of their or its affiliates, management and relatives) and which is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors, unless the closely related party was unaware of the debtor’s intent to prejudice its creditors; - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a claim of a shareholder for repayment of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) made to the debtor or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, if the act occurred during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction the act occurred during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder _Bürge)._ In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if she or he was aware of the debtor’s actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or impending illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor´s creditors, provided that, if the relevant act by the debtor consisted of a settlement of an obligation or the grant of a security which was due to be paid or granted, as the case may be, then the knowledge of the debtor´s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors is only presumed if the other party was aware of the actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor and of the fact that the transaction prejudiced the debtor´s creditors. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge.” If any of the guarantees given or any security interest granted by any of the German Guarantors were avoided or held unenforceable for any reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect thereof. Any amounts received from a transaction that has been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvent estate and you would have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining security, if any. ----- The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) (Bargeschäftsprivileg) by not being subject to certain avoidance rights. Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction on its enforceable claims by a levy of execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency Code and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Gesetz über den Stabilisierungs- und _Restrukturierungsrahmen) (“Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for_ out-of-court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens). Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in cases in which a debtor faces imminent illiquidity, i.e., that there is the imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months. A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence of imminent illiquidity which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under “—Insolvency.”). Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor). However, the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a respective application of the provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies (see above under “—Insolvency.”). ----- The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan, which can be submitted solely by the debtor, can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown). The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied. For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its centre of main interest in Germany would be the following: - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review and/or supervision by a court; - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight months due to a stabilization order; - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right); - any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram- down are fulfilled, even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes. Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation as a recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. However, this does not apply to plans in non-public restructuring matters under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act as they are not mentioned in Exhibit A of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. Except for public restructuring matters, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

KG, a limited partnership with a GmbH (Limited Liability Company) as its sole general partner. Consequently, the granting of guarantees by these German Guarantors is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, the “GmbHG”). Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, the “HGB”) (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Begründung einer Unterbilanz) or would increase any already existing capital impairment (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiary guarantors to grant guarantees to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, notes, indentures and guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form ----- of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG with a GmbH as its sole general partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to enforce the guarantees against the German Guarantors only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital. Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law the documentation in relation to the guarantees provided by a German Guarantor contains, and the Indenture will contain, such contractual limitation language and such guarantees are limited in the manner described. These limitations would, to the extent applicable, restrict the right of payment and would limit the claim accordingly irrespective of the granting of the subsidiary guarantee. This could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee by a German Guarantor cannot be enforced at all. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding socalled—destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a subsidiary guarantee granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary guarantor or sister company of the Issuer. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the subsidiary guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if for example the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a limited liability company or of a limited partnership, the general partner or general partners of which is or are a limited liability company, which can negatively affect the ability of the German subsidiaries to make payments on the guarantees or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.6,Germany,326.6.6,,"We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. Courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. Court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. Court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. Court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court will be conditional upon a number of requirements, including the following: - the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law; - the U.S. court could take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles on jurisdictional competence according to German law - the document introducing the proceedings was duly made known to the defendant in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense; - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in Germany and the procedure leading to the respective judgment is not in contradiction to any such prior judgment; - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including, without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it should be noted that any component of a U.S. Court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will usually not be enforced in Germany. They may be regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law; - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. Courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In addition, it is doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated solely on U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts as being incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.7,Luxembourg,326.7.1,Insolvency Proceedings,"Certain guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg (each a “Luxembourg Guarantor”). Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings with respect to a Luxembourg Guarantor, as an entity having its registered office and central administration (administration centrale) and center of main interest, as used in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its center of main interest in the jurisdiction in which it has the place of its registered office. As a result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the center of main interest of each of the Luxembourg Guarantors is in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and consequently that any “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law. However, the determination of where a Luxembourg Guarantor has its center of main interest is a question of fact, which may change from time to time. The E.U. Insolvency Regulation states that the center of main interest of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties.” In the Eurofood IFSC Limited decision by the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”), the ECJ restated the presumption in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation that the place of a company’s registered office is presumed to be the company’s center of main interest and stated that the presumption can only be rebutted if “factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties enable it to be established that an actual situation exists which is different from that which locating it at the registered office is deemed to reflect.” Under Luxembourg insolvency laws, the following types of proceedings (the “Insolvency Proceedings”) may be opened against the Luxembourg Guarantors: ----- - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which is initiated by the relevant guarantor, by any of its creditors or by Luxembourg courts ex officio. The managers/directors of the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor have the obligation to file for bankruptcy within one month in case it is in a state of cessation of payment (cessation de paiement). Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings, if the relevant guarantor (i) is in default of payment (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open ex officio bankruptcy proceedings, absent a request made by the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor. The main effects of such proceedings are (i) the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors and (ii) the payment of the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor’s creditors in accordance with their ranking upon the realization of the guarantor’s assets. In addition to these proceedings, the ability of the holders of Notes to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiements) or to put the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor is put into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg laws governing commercial companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings. In accordance with and pursuant to the law of 7 August 2023 on the preservation of businesses and the modernization of bankruptcy, the following measures, among others, aiming at preventing bankruptcy proceedings could be requested by a debtor as of 1 November 2023: (i) a preventive process aiming at appointing a conciliator (conciliateur d’entreprise) whose assignment is to facilitate the reorganization of all or part of a debtor’s activities, (ii) out-of-court proceedings pursuant to which a mutual agreement may be concluded between a debtor and creditors to reorganize all or part of the debtor’s assets or business; and (iii) judicial reorganization proceedings to preserve, under the control of the delegate judge, the continuity of all or part of the assets or the business of a debtor. The relevant Luxembourg Guarantor’s liabilities in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the guarantor following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those of the relevant Luxembourg Guarantor’s debts that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. For example, preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Inland Revenue (Administration des contributions directes); - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Registration Duties, Estates and VAT Authority (Administration _de l’enregistrement, des domaines et de la TVA) or to the Customs and Excise Agency (Administration des douanes et accises);_ - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive. Assets in the form of shares or receivables over which a security interest has been granted and perfected will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized), and subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law. During insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. A reorganization order requires the prior approval of more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant guarantor’s liabilities in order to take effect. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the guarantor during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “hardening period” (période suspecte), which is a maximum of six months, plus ten days, preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceedings under Luxembourg law. In particular: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets or entering into transactions generally ----- without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the hardening period (or the ten days preceding it) will be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; article 445 does not apply for financial collateral arrangements and set-off arrangements subject to the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”), such as Luxembourg Law pledges over shares or receivables. - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts, as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the hardening period, are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; such hardening period rule does not apply for financial collateral arrangements and set-off arrangements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares or receivables. - article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Civil Code (action paulienne) gives the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. The Luxembourg Collateral Law provides that with the exception of the provisions on over-indebtedness (surendettement) (which only apply to natural persons), the national or foreign provisions governing reorganization measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments are not applicable to financial collateral arrangements (such as Luxembourg pledges over shares or receivables) and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their obligations. Certain preferred creditors of a Luxembourg company (including the Luxembourg tax, social security and other authorities) may have a privilege that ranks senior to the rights of the secured or unsecured creditors. Foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg pledgor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Insolvency Proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to Luxembourg security interests falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Law. In such situation, Luxembourg hardening period (période suspecte) rules are disapplied (save for the case of fraud). In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for _intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore,_ subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency Proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on the business and assets of a Luxembourg Guarantor and the obligations of a Luxembourg Guarantor under the Notes offered hereby.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event. However, such clauses may not always be effective and enforceable against the bankruptcy receiver taking into account the interest of the distressed company and the legally binding provisions of bankruptcy laws in Luxembourg; and - intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy.

The breach of any of such conditions may render such security interests invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities (e.g., judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be time consuming in the event that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. Case law on security interests over intellectual property rights is very limited. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge agreement must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the security interest) and (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge over receivables becomes enforceable against the debtor of the receivables and third parties from the moment when the agreement pursuant to which the pledge was created is entered into between the pledgor and the pledgee. However, if the debtor has not been notified of the pledge or if he did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, he will be validly discharged if he pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank. In addition, the account bank has to waive any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such registrations, notifications and acceptances occur, the pledge agreements are not effective and perfected against the debtors, the account banks and other third parties. The Luxembourg Collateral Law sets out the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event: - direct appropriation of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets; - sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially reasonable terms (conditions commerciales _normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange, or (iii) by way of a public auction;_ - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. ----- Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the E.U. Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 5 of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes in particular the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

The granting of cross- or up-stream security interests and guarantees by a Luxembourg company in order to secure the obligations of other entities may raise some corporate benefit issues, in particular in relation to the corporate interest of the Luxembourg company having to provide such security interests/guarantees. The Luxembourg company law does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. However, it is generally admitted that the granting of a guarantee by a Luxembourg company for the obligations of another group company shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) it must be within the corporate purpose of the guarantor as set out in its articles of association; (ii) it shall correspond to a demonstrable and commensurate corporate benefit received by the guarantor company and (iii) the financial obligations assumed by the guarantor must not be disproportionate to the financial capacity of the guarantor. Whether an action is in the corporate interest of a company is a matter of fact not a legal issue. The directors/managers of a company are those who are able to assess whether such company has a corporate benefit and interest in granting cross- or up-stream security interests or guarantees. It is considered that a company may give a guarantee or security interest, provided the giving of the guarantee or security interest is covered by the company’s corporate objects and in the best interest of the company. The test regarding the guarantor’s corporate interest is whether the company that provides the guarantee/security interest receives some consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. A guarantee/security interest that exceeds the guarantor company’s ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other creditors would expose its directors or managers to personal liability. It cannot ultimately be excluded that granting of security interest/guarantee, which would be considered by a Luxembourg court as made in the absence of corporate interest, be declared void. The Guarantee granted by each of the Luxembourg Guarantors may be limited to a certain percentage of, among other things, the company’s own funds (capitaux propres) and intra-group indebtedness. Finally, each of the Luxembourg Guarantors has been incorporated in the form of a private limited liability company (société à _responsabilité limitée, or “Sàrl”). Enforcement on these entities will depend on their financial situation and will only be limited to their_ assets.

To the extent that_ Dutch law applies, a legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party and any other legal act having a similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person and may be nullified by the receiver in bankruptcy in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, if (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) generally the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act, and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the party with or towards which it acted, knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (om niet) in which case such knowledge of the party with or towards which it acted is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent transfer. In addition, in the case of such a bankruptcy, the receiver in bankruptcy may nullify the debtor’s performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee (hij die betaling ontving) knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of payment, or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee with a view to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184
311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.8,The Netherlands,326.8.2,Bankruptcy Proceedings Under Dutch Law,"Under Dutch law, there are two corporate insolvency regimes: (1) a moratorium of payments (surséance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern, and (2) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily designed to liquidate and distribute the (proceeds of the) assets of a debtor to its creditors. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A moratorium of payments is a court ordered general suspension of a debtor’s obligations to its creditors. A moratorium of payments can be granted only at the request of the debtor and on the ground that the debtor foresees to be unable to continue payments when they fall due. A moratorium could be used as a defense by the debtor against a bankruptcy application by a creditor. It may be ordered only by the district court located in the district in which the company has its statutory seat. Upon the filing of the request for a moratorium, the court will generally immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional moratorium and appoint an administrator (bewindvoerder) of the debtor’s estate. Subsequently, a court hearing of among others the unsecured non-preferential creditors is required to decide on the definitive moratorium. The court will then decide whether to grant a definitive moratorium or, alternatively, the court may declare the debtor bankrupt. If a draft composition (ontwerpakkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments, the court can order that the composition be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium is made. If the composition is accepted and subsequently confirmed by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium ends. A definitive moratorium will generally be granted unless a qualified minority ((i) at least one-fourth of the total amount of unsecured claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or (ii) at least one-third in number of creditors represented at such meeting) of all unsecured non-preferential creditors withholds its consent. The moratorium of payments is only effective with regard to unsecured non-preferential creditors. A moratorium takes effect retroactively until midnight on the day on which the court has granted the provisional moratorium. Secured and preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities) may enforce their rights against assets of the debtor in moratorium of payments to satisfy their claims as if there were no moratorium of payments. A ----- recovery under Dutch law could, therefore, involve a sale of assets that does not reflect the going concern value of the debtor. However, the court may order a “cooling down period” for a maximum period of four months during which enforcement actions by secured or preferential creditors are barred. In a moratorium of payments, a composition (akkoord) may be offered by the debtor to its creditors. Such a composition will be binding on all unsecured and non-preferential creditors, irrespective whether they voted in favor or against it or whether they were represented at the creditor’s meeting called for the purpose of voting on the composition plan, if: (i) it is approved by more than 50% in number of the general unsecured and non-preferential creditors present or represented at the creditor’s meeting, representing at least 50% in amount of the general unsecured and non-preferential claims admitted for voting purposes; and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch moratorium of payments proceedings could reduce the recovery of note holders. Interest payments that fall due after the date on which a moratorium of payments is granted cannot be claimed in a composition. Bankruptcy is a court ordered general attachment of the assets of a debtor for the benefit of the debtor’s collective creditors. The purpose of bankruptcy is to provide for a liquidation and distribution of the proceeds of the debtor’s assets among its creditors in accordance with the respective rank and priority of their claims. Bankruptcy may be ordered only by the district court located in the district in which the company has its statutory seat. An application for bankruptcy can be made by either (i) one or more creditors of the debtor, (ii) the public prosecutor (if the public interest so requires) or (iii) the debtor itself, on the grounds that the debtor has ceased paying its debts. A debtor is considered to have ceased paying its debts if it has more than one creditor and if at least one of its payment obligations is due but unpaid. As a result of a bankruptcy, the debtor loses all rights to administer and dispose of its assets. Furthermore, all pending executions of judgments and any attachments on the debtor’s assets (other than with respect to secured creditors and certain other creditors, as further described below) will be terminated by operation of law, and any pending litigation on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically suspended. A bankruptcy order takes effect retroactively until midnight on the day the order is rendered. In the event of bankruptcy, a court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (curator) at its own discretion, which, in most cases, will be a practicing lawyer in the Netherlands. The receiver in bankruptcy manages the bankrupt estate, which consists of all of the debtor’s assets and liabilities that exist on the date on which the bankruptcy was opened, and of all assets acquired during the bankruptcy. The bankruptcy estate is not liable for obligations incurred by the debtor after the bankruptcy order, except to the extent that such obligations arise from transactions that are beneficial to the estate. A receiver in bankruptcy operates under the supervision of a supervisory judge (rechter-commissaris) designated by the court, and thus most of a receiver in bankruptcy’s major decisions require the prior approval of the supervisory judge. There is no legal duty for a debtor or its managing board to file for bankruptcy. However, if the managing board of a company realizes that the company is or will be unable to pay its debts when they come due, it is required to take appropriate measures, which could include the cessation of trading, notification of creditors and the filing for either bankruptcy or a moratorium as described above. The general principle of Dutch bankruptcy law is the so-called paritas creditorum (principle of equal treatment), which means that all creditors have an equal right to payment and that the proceeds of bankruptcy proceedings shall be distributed in proportion to the size of their claims. However, certain creditors (such as secured creditors and preferential creditors, including tax and social security authorities) will have special rights that take priority over the rights of other creditors. As a general rule, all unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims need to be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in bankruptcy makes a preliminary determination as to the existence, ranking and value of the claim and whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the debtor’s shareholders. Secured creditors (other than the holders of the Notes, which are unsecured creditors) can exercise their rights during the bankruptcy or a moratorium as normal. However, the bankruptcy judge may call a “freeze order” (afkoelingsperiode) for a maximum period of four months (consisting of an initial two months, with a possible two month extension), during which period the secured creditors cannot exercise their rights unless such creditors have obtained a leave for enforcement from the bankruptcy judge. The receiver in bankruptcy can force secured creditors to enforce their security rights within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver in bankruptcy will be entitled to sell the secured assets and distribute the proceeds. The receiver in bankruptcy is authorized to make such forced sales in order to prevent a secured creditor from delaying the enforcement of the security without good reason. If a receiver in bankruptcy does make a forced sale of secured assets, the secured creditors have to contribute to the general bankruptcy expenses (algemene _faillissementskosten) and will receive payment from the proceeds of that sale prior to ordinary, non-preferred creditors having an_ insolvency claim, but after creditors of the estate (boedelschuldeisers), and subject to satisfaction of higher ranking claims of creditors. Dutch tax authorities (belastingdienst) have a preferential claim in respect of the collection of certain taxes (for example, social security premiums, wage tax, value added tax, etc.) on certain movable property found on the debtor’s premises (bodemvoorrecht). They may take recourse against such property irrespective of whether any security interests over such property exist. Excess proceeds of ----- enforcement of security rights must be returned to the debtor in bankruptcy and may not be set off against any unsecured claims that the secured creditors may have. Such set off is, in principle, only allowed prior to the bankruptcy proceedings. Interest accruing after the date of the bankruptcy order cannot be admitted unless secured by a pledge or mortgage. In that event, interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security the creditor may not derive any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy. The existence, value and ranking of any claims submitted by the holders of the Notes may be challenged in the Dutch bankruptcy proceedings. Generally, in a creditors’ meeting (verificatievergadering), the receiver in bankruptcy, the insolvent debtor and all verified creditors may dispute the verification of any other claim that has been submitted for verification. Creditors whose claims or value thereof are disputed in the creditors’ meeting may be referred to separate court proceedings (renvooi procedure). As in a moratorium of payment proceedings, in bankruptcy a composition may be offered to creditors, which will be binding upon all unsecured and non-preferential creditors, if: (i) it is approved by a simple majority of the creditors being present or represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are admitted for voting purposes, and (ii) it is subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy proceedings could reduce the recovery of holders of the Notes offered hereby. The Dutch Bankruptcy Act does not in itself recognize the concept of classes of creditors. Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among the unsecured non-preferential creditors on a pro rata basis. Contractual subordination may, to a certain extent, be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. However, the actual effect depends largely on the way such subordination is construed. Foreign creditors are, in general, not treated different from creditors that are incorporated or residing in the Netherlands. Bankruptcy related proceedings in the Netherlands may be time consuming and subject to significant delays and incidental litigation.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

Under Dutch law, receipt of any payment made by any Dutch guarantor under a guarantee may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such guarantee. The validity and enforceability of a guarantee of any Dutch guarantor may also be successfully contested by such Dutch guarantor (or their receiver in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, as further described below. The validity and enforceability of the obligations of our Dutch subsidiaries under a guarantee may also be successfully contested by any creditor, or by the subsidiaries’ respective receiver in bankruptcy when the subsidiary is in bankruptcy proceedings, if such obligation is prejudicial to the interests of any other creditor and the other requirements for voidable preference under the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and Dutch Bankruptcy Act are met, as further described below. As a result, the value of the guarantee provided by the Dutch Guarantors may be limited. To the extent Dutch law applies, payment under a guarantee may be withheld under doctrines of reasonableness and fairness (redelijkheid en billijkheid), force majeure (niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene _omstandigheden) and other defences afforded by Dutch law to obligors generally. Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee_ or security interest should be avoided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Furthermore, to the exten Dutch law applies, a party to an agreement may under certain circumstances suspend performance of its obligations under such agreement pursuant to the exceptio non-adimpleti contractus or otherwise. ----- Pursuant to Article 2:7 of the Dutch Civil Code, any transaction entered into by a legal entity may be nullified by the legal entity itself or its receiver in bankruptcy pursuant to an ultra vires claim if the objects of that entity were transgressed by the transaction and the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation (wist of zonder eigen onderzoek _moest weten). The Dutch Supreme Court (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) has ruled that in determining whether the objects of a legal_ entity are transgressed, not only the description of the objects in that legal entity’s articles of association is decisive, but all (relevant) circumstances must be taken into account, in particular whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its benefit; and whether the subsistence of the company is jeopardised by the transaction.

311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,326,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES,326.9,Switzerland,326.9.1,Insolvency Proceedings,"Certain subsidiary guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Switzerland (the “Swiss Guarantors”). In the event of any such Swiss Guarantor’s insolvency, insolvency proceedings may, therefore, only be initiated in Switzerland and Swiss insolvency law would then govern those proceedings. The insolvency laws of Switzerland and, in particular, the provisions of the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs) may be less favorable to the interests of creditors than the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and therefore may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Switzerland. Under general Swiss insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which means there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity has, from an insolvency law point of view, to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of, and vis-à-vis, each entity have to be dealt with separately. Under Swiss insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex officio, but rather require that a creditor file a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (as discussed in the paragraphs below). Moreover, insolvency proceedings must be initiated by the debtor itself according to Swiss corporate law in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or can be initiated by a creditor according to Swiss insolvency law in the event that the debtor has obviously and permanently stopped to pay its debts as and when they fall due or has acted fraudulently, or is attempting to act fraudulently to the detriment of its creditors. Furthermore, a debtor may also initiate insolvency proceedings if it declares itself insolvent (zahlungsunfähig) before court. Generally, pursuant to the Swiss corporate law, a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets, which must be assessed on the basis of a balance sheet to be drawn up (i) on the basis of the liquidation value of the debtor’s assets and (ii) based upon the going concern value. If the interim balance sheet shows that the creditors’ claims are neither covered by assets valued at liquidation values nor at going concern values, the debtor’s board of directors has to notify the bankruptcy court, provided that creditors of the debtor do not agree to subordinate their claims in the amount necessary to cover the over-indebtedness (Article 725 Swiss Code of Obligations). The debtor’s board of directors is obliged to file for insolvency without delay and non-compliance with this obligation potentially exposes the board of directors to damage claims and sanctions under criminal law. Under certain circumstances, the auditors of an over-indebted company are obliged to file for insolvency. ----- If a creditor wants to initiate insolvency proceedings, such creditor has to file an application for commencement of enforcement proceedings (Betreibungsbegehren) with the competent debt collection office (Betreibungsamt). With respect to unsecured claims, the competent debt collection office is located where the debtor is registered or resident. The debt collection office will then serve the debtor with the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl). There is no material assessment of the claim at this stage. The debtor may within ten days upon having been served with the writ of payment, file an objection (Rechtsvorschlag) to bring the procedure to a halt and obtain an individual stay of proceedings. No reasons need to be given for such objection. The debt collection office notifies the respective creditor of the objection. For claims based on an enforceable judgment, the creditor can without any further delay file an application to lift this stay with the court (Rechtsöffnungsbegehren). For claims not based on an enforceable judgment, but on a certified and/or signed document evidencing the claim, provisional lifting of such stay can be applied for in summary proceedings (provisorische Rechtsöffnung). In the event the objection is set aside in these summary proceedings, the debtor may within 20 days bring an action in ordinary court proceedings for negative declaration that the creditor’s claim does not exist (Aberkennungsklage). The creditor may then ask the debt collection office to continue the enforcement proceeding (Fortsetzungsbegehren) in relation to an existing writ of payment having full force and effect. The competent debt collection office delivers a bankruptcy warning (Konkursandrohung) to the debtor. The insolvency court may take preliminary measures to secure property of the debtor in case this is requested by a creditor and required to secure the creditor’s rights. After 20 days from delivery of the bankruptcy warning (Konkursandrohung), the creditor may petition the opening of insolvency proceedings. The competent insolvency court decides upon the insolvency without any delay, provided that there are no reasons which would lead to a suspension of the insolvency court’s decision. In addition, the debtor has the right to file a request for a moratorium. The parties may file an appeal against any decision taken by the insolvency court. The insolvency court orders the continuation of insolvency proceedings if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only order to continue insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs of the insolvency proceedings themselves within 10 days of a respective public announcement. In the absence of such advancement, the insolvency proceedings will be closed for insufficiency of assets (Einstellung des Konkursverfahrens mangels Aktiven). Alternatively, the insolvency office may request the insolvency court to resolve upon summary insolvency proceedings (summarisches _Konkursverfahren), if the assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of ordinary insolvency proceedings and the actual facts of the case_ are not complicated. Also, in such case, creditors have the right to request ordinary insolvency proceedings provided that adequate security for the relevant costs is given by the respective creditor. After an insolvency has been declared, all of the debtor’s assets, including assets which are subject to a pledge and similar security rights are considered to be part of the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse). Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), the right to administer and dispose over the business and the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency office (Konkursamt). The insolvency office has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s estate (Konkursmasse), provided that certain acts require the approval of the insolvency court. The creditors’ meeting may appoint a private insolvency administration (private Konkursverwaltung) and, in addition, a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss). In such case, the private insolvency administration will be competent to maintain and liquidate the debtor’s estate. The creditors’ committee has additional competences. Insolvency results in the acceleration of all claims against a debtor (secured or unsecured), except for those secured by a mortgage on the debtor’s real property. As a result of such acceleration, a creditor’s bankruptcy claim consists of the principal amount of the debt (discounted at 5% if not interest bearing), interest accrued thereon until the date of insolvency, and (limited) costs of enforcement. Upon insolvency, interest ceases to accrue. Only claims secured by a pledge enjoy a preferential treatment insofar as interest that would have accrued until the collateral is realized will be honored if and to such extent as the proceeds of the collateral suffice to cover such interests. All creditors, whether secured or unsecured, wishing to assert claims against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings in Switzerland. Swiss insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with, and subject to, the restrictions of Swiss insolvency laws. Therefore, secured creditors are generally (subject to certain exceptions) not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Vorzugsrechte). Generally, entitlement to realize such security is vested with the insolvency administration. Realization proceedings are governed by Swiss insolvency laws which provide for a public auction, or, subject to certain conditions, a private sale. Proceeds from enforcement are used to cover (i) enforcement costs, (ii) the claims of the secured creditor and (iii) any excess proceeds will be used to satisfy unsecured creditors. Typically, liabilities resulting from acts of the insolvency administrator after commencement of formal insolvency proceedings constitute liabilities and are paid out of the debtor’s estate. Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Konkursforderungen), in ----- particular claims of unsecured creditors, will be satisfied pursuant to the distribution provisions of Swiss insolvency laws, which provide for certain privileged classes of creditors, such as a debtor’s employees. All other creditors will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there are funds remaining in the debtor’s estate after the security interests and privileged claims have been settled and paid in full. Swiss insolvency law also provides for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor’s creditors. Reorganization is initiated by a request with the competent court for a stay (Nachlassstundung) pending negotiation of one of the several statutory types of composition agreement with the creditors and confirmation of such agreement by the competent court. Under Swiss insolvency laws, the insolvency administration may, under certain conditions, avoid transactions, such as, inter alia, the granting of, or the payment under, any guarantee or security or, if a payment has already been made under the relevant guarantee or security, require that the recipients return the amount received to the debtor’s estate. In particular, a transaction (which term includes the granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the debtor’s other creditors may be avoided according to Swiss insolvency laws in the following cases if such acts result in damages to the creditors: - The debtor has made a transaction being considered as a gift or a disposal of assets without any consideration, provided that the debtor made such transaction within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung). Similarly, transactions pursuant to which the debtor received a consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance, may be avoided. - Certain acts are voidable if performed by the debtor within the last year prior to the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung), provided that the debtor was already over-indebted at that time: (i) granting of security for already existing claims, provided that the debtor was not previously obliged to grant such security, (ii) payment of a monetary obligation (Geldschuld) in any other way than by payment in cash (Barschaft) or other customary means of payment, and (iii) the payment of a debt not yet due. However, any avoidance action is excluded if the beneficiary of the transaction can prove that it was not aware of the debtor’s over-indebtedness and, being diligent, could not know that the debtor had been over-indebted at that time. - Furthermore, any acts performed within the last five years prior to, inter alia, the opening of formal insolvency proceedings (Konkurseröffnung) performed by the debtor with the intention to disadvantage its creditors, or discriminate some creditors against others or to favor some creditors to others are voidable if such intention was, or exercising the requisite due diligence must have been known, to the debtor’s counterparty. If any guarantee in favor of the Notes by a Swiss Guarantor is avoided as summarized above or held unenforceable for any other reason, the claimant would cease to have any claim in respect of the guarantee and would have a claim solely under the Notes and the remaining guarantees, if any. Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been avoided would have to be repaid.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

Therefore, in order to enable the Swiss Guarantors to grant guarantees securing liabilities of the Issuer without the risk of violating such restrictions, it is standard market practice, inter alia, for guarantees, security documents and other upstream or cross-stream obligations to contain a so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Switzerland in the form of a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) or Swiss limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung). Pursuant to such limitation language, the obligations under any guarantee granted by each of the Swiss Guarantors will be limited to its freely disposable equity from time to time, if and to the extent such requirements apply. The freely disposable equity is equal to the maximum amount which the relevant Swiss Guarantor can distribute to its shareholders as a dividend payment under Swiss law, as determined in accordance with Swiss law, presently being the total shareholder equity less the total of (i) the aggregate share capital and (ii) statutory reserves (including reserves for own shares and revaluations as well as capital surplus (agio)), to the extent such reserves cannot be transferred into unrestricted, distributable reserves, and require further corporate action by the Swiss Guarantor and may be subject to withholding tax.

A U.S. court would likely find that an Obligor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes offered hereby or such guarantee if such Obligor did not benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable guarantee. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not an Obligor was solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that payments to holders of the Notes offered hereby constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent by a U.S. court if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. If the Notes offered hereby or guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any claim you may make against any Obligor for amounts payable on the Notes offered hereby would be unenforceable to the extent of such avoidance or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by any Obligor. Although any guarantee entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes offered hereby will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect such guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

However, the court will refuse enforcement in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of International Private Law and notably, if, among other things: - the consequences of the enforcement of the judgment would be manifestly contrary to Belgian public policy; - the rights of defense were not respected; - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets in such state without any further connection with the litigation in such state; - without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the judgment is not final or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of the State where the judgment was rendered or the applicable federal rules; - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian conflict of law rules; - the decision is in conflict with either a decision rendered in Belgium or a decision previously rendered in another state that can be recognized in Belgium; - the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and relating to the same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court; - the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim; or - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to insolvency proceedings.

Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any U.S. Court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in England (an “English court”). In such an action, an English court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law; - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or statute or the Human Rights Act 1998; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a non-English penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; and - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. ----- Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. Courts.

In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

As a result, U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The amount of any OID includible in income by a U.S. holder of a Note is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note (“accrued OID”). A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The “accrual period” of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is ----- no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or stated interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period.

OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity, other than a payment of stated interest, and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation: - banks, thrifts and other financial institutions; - U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States; - insurance companies; - dealers in securities or currencies and traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities; - entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes or investors in such entities; - U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the United States dollar; - holders subject to any alternative minimum tax; - tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations; - regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts; - holders of the Existing 2025 Euro Notes whose interests in the Existing 2025 Euro Notes are redeemed substantially contemporaneously with this offering; - persons deemed to sell the Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code; - persons that are resident or ordinarily resident or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States; - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement; and - persons holding the Notes offered hereby as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated transaction. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend upon the tax status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder of the Notes offered hereby that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and partners in such partnership, should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the entity’s purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes offered hereby. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes offered hereby for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes offered hereby are sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers) and deals only with Notes offered hereby held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed with the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered (as described above) would apply to foreign passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the U.S. Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. The Netherlands has entered into an agreement with the United States to implement FATCA in a manner that may modify the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

Irrespective of the actual income or capital gains realized, the annual taxable benefit of all the assets and liabilities of a Dutch Individual that are taxed under this regime, including the Notes, is based on fictitious percentages applied to the fair market value of (i) bank savings, (ii) other assets, including the Notes, and (iii) liabilities. Taxation only occurs if and to the extent the sum of the fair market value of bank savings and other assets minus the fair market value of the liabilities exceeds a certain threshold (heffingvrij vermogen). The tax rate under the regime for savings and investments is a flat rate of 32 percent. For the calendar year 2023, the fictitious percentages applicable to the first and third categories mentioned above (bank savings and liabilities) have not yet been determined. The fictitious yield percentage applicable to the second category mentioned above (other assets, including the Notes) is 6.17 percent for the calendar year 2023. Certain transactions that have the effect of reducing the fictitious yield by shifting net wealth between the aforementioned categories (i) and (ii) or increasing liabilities in any three months period starting before and ending after 1 January of the relevant year will for this purpose be ignored unless the Noteholder can demonstrate that such transactions are implemented for other reasons than tax reasons. The fictitious percentages referred to above are considered by the Dutch government to be in compliance with a decision of the Dutch Supreme Court of 24 December 2021 (ECLI:NL:HR:2021:1963) regarding the incompatibility of the previous regime for savings and investments with the European Convention on Human Rights. Noteholders are nevertheless advised to consult their tax advisor on whether any tax levied under the current regime for savings and investments, including in respect of the Notes, is in accordance with this convention. _Dutch Corporate Entities_ Dutch Corporate Entities are generally subject to corporate income tax at the statutory rate of 25.8 percent with respect to any benefits derived or deemed to be derived (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) from the Notes offered hereby. A reduced rate of 19.0 percent applies to the first EUR 200,000 of taxable profits. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

For Dutch tax purposes, a Noteholder may include an individual who or entity that does not have the legal title of the Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes offered hereby are, or income from the Notes is, attributed based either on such individual or entity owning a beneficial interest in the Notes offered hereby or based on specific statutory provisions. These include statutory provisions pursuant to which the Notes offered hereby are attributed to an individual who is, or who has directly or indirectly inherited from a person who was the settlor, grantor or similar originator of a trust, foundation or similar entity that holds the Notes offered hereby. Prospective Noteholders should consult their tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of any purchase, ownership or disposal of the Notes offered hereby. The following summary is based on the Dutch tax law as applied and interpreted by Dutch tax courts and as published and in effect on the date hereof, including the tax rates applicable on that date, without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect. For the purpose of this paragraph, “Dutch Taxes” shall mean taxes of whatever nature levied by or on behalf of the Netherlands or any of its subdivisions or taxing authorities or to the law governing such taxes, respectively.

Generally, a substantial interest in the Issuer arises if the Noteholder, alone or – in case of an individual – together with a partner for Dutch tax purposes, or any relative by blood or by marriage in the ascending or descending line (including foster-children) of the Noteholder or the partner, owns or holds, or is deemed to own or hold, any share or certain rights over (including rights to, directly or indirectly, acquire) shares representing, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of the total issued and outstanding capital of the Issuer or of the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares, or profit participating certificates (winstbewijzen) relating to five percent or more of annual profits or liquidation proceeds of the Issuer; - that is an entity which is, pursuant to the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969) (the “CITA”), not subject to Dutch corporate income tax or is in full or in part exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as qualifying pension funds as described in Section 5 CITA and a tax exempt investment fund (vrijgestelde _beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 6a CITA), or is an entity that is not tax resident in the Netherlands and that_ functions in a manner that is comparable to a tax exempt investment fund (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 6a CITA); - that is an investment institution (beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 28 CITA, or is an entity that is not tax resident in the Netherlands and that functions in a manner that is comparable to an investment institution (beleggingsinstelling) as described in Section 28 CITA; or - that is an entity which is related (gelieerd) to the Issuer within the meaning of the Withholding Tax Act 2021 (Wet _Bronbelasting 2021). An entity is considered related if (i) it has a Qualifying Interest in the Issuer, (ii) the Issuer has a_ Qualifying Interest in the Noteholder, or (iii) a third party has a Qualifying Interest in both the Issuer and the Noteholder.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the Notes with the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Plan fiduciaries should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, any guarantors or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser.

311,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which an issuer, an initial purchaser or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by inhouse asset managers, although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of a Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully review the PTCE and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes offered hereby should consult with its counsel ----- before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. We understand that DTC is a limited-purpose trust company created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. ----- We also understand that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interest in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.",N/A,as_expected,2023,184

We understand that DTC’s current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC.

We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers against liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments which they may be required to make in that respect. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes offered hereby as permitted by applicable law.

Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to the public and to reject orders in whole or in part. The initial purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, and covering transactions in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act: - over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. - stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. - covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes offered hereby in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes offered hereby to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time.

Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days prior to their delivery hereunder should consult their own advisors. The initial purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
