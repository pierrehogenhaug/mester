**IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING, DEUTSCHE BANK AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, LONDON**
**BRANCH (THE “STABILIZING MANAGER”) (OR PERSONS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING**
**MANAGER) MAY OVER-ALLOT NOTES OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING**
**THE MARKET PRICE OF THE NOTES AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE**
**PREVAIL. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE STABILIZING MANAGER (OR PERSONS**
**ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE STABILIZING MANAGER) WILL UNDERTAKE STABILIZATION ACTION.**
**ANY STABILIZATION ACTION MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH ADEQUATE PUBLIC**
**DISCLOSURE OF THE FINAL TERMS OF THE OFFER OF THE NOTES IS MADE AND, IF BEGUN, MAY**

**ALTERNATIVE SETTLEMENT CYCLE**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefore on or around the date specified on the cover
page of this offering memorandum, which will be the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless
the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date
of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time
of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing
or the next seven succeeding business days should consult their own advisor.

**NOTICE TO EEA INVESTORS**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in any Member State of the European
Economic Area (the “EEA”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This document is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus
Regulation. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of June 14, 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to
trading on a regulated market (as amended or superseded), and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC, and includes any relevant
implementing measure in the Member State concerned.

**PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ELIGIBLE COUNTERPARTIES ONLY TARGET MARKET**

all channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person

manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the
FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018; and (ii) all channels

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws of certain
applicable jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all statements other than
statements of historical facts contained in this offering memorandum, including, without limitation, those regarding our
future financial position and results of operations, our strategy, plans, objectives, goals and targets, future developments in

for the electricity sector and the natural gas sector;

 - failure to successfully implementing our business strategy, continue our Continuous Improvement Program and to
further improve our operational efficiency and asset utilization and to successfully implement our business strategy;

 - adverse effects arising from costs and difficulties of acquiring and integrating complementary businesses;

- public opposition to the operation of our existing facilities and/or to our ongoing or potential future expansion
projects;

 - other factors discussed in “Risk Factors”.

The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of this offering memorandum are not exhaustive. Other sections of this
offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive industry. New risks may emerge from time to time, and it is
not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
forward-looking statements.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this offering memorandum entitled “Risk Factors”, “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Industry and Competition” and “Business”_
for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the markets in which we operate.
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking statements described in this offering
memorandum may not be accurate or occur at all.

Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only
as of the date on which the statements were made (and in any case no later than the date of this offering memorandum). In
addition, from time to time, we and our representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may
make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not
limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other communications. Although
we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance
that such expectations will prove to be correct.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statements or risk factors, whether
as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking
statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**General**

In this offering memorandum, the term “financial statements” refers to the audited consolidated financial statements and
the notes thereto of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021,
2022 and 2023. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and
2023, along with the independent auditor’s reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,
Glücksteinallee 43-45, 68163 Mannheim, (“PwC”) a member of the German Chamber of Public Acountants
(Wirtschaftsprüferkammer), Berlin, with respect to the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended
December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 are included in this offering memorandum beginning on page F-2.

Our financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with German GAAP,
which differs in certain significant respects from IFRS. For a discussion of significant differences between German GAAP
and IFRS, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of
_Significant Differences between German GAAP and IFRS”. Prospective investors are advised to consult their professional_
advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between German GAAP and IFRS and other frameworks for generally
accepted accounting principles and how those differences might affect the financial information included in this offering
memorandum and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of, German GAAP may have on our results of
operations or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of the prior periods.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering to which this
offering memorandum relates and of the financial statements and financial information contained in this offering
memorandum. We do not present separate financial statements of the Guarantors in this offering memorandum, because
all such entities are wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by the Issuer, and the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows of such entities are therefore consolidated within our financial statements contained herein.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements
of the SEC and to comply with the applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and
regulations of the SEC, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data and operational volumes presented
in million or thousand and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result,
the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information.
The financial information and financial statements included in this offering memorandum are presented in euro. Amounts
presented in euro per ton are not part of the financial statements but are taken from the management reporting of the Group.
Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” are calculated using the
numerical data in the financial statements contained in this offering memorandum, as applicable, and not using the
numerical data in the narrative description thereof. With respect to financial information set out in this offering
memorandum, a dash (“—”) signifies that the relevant figure is not available or not meaningful, while a zero (“0”) signifies
that the relevant figure is available but is or has been rounded to zero.

The financial information marked as “audited” in tables in this offering memorandum is taken from the audited consolidated
financial statements, included elsewhere in the offering memorandum. The financial information marked as “unaudited”
in tables in this offering memorandum is taken from the Company’s accounting records or internal management reporting
and controlling systems or is based on calculations of figures from the abovementioned sources, including the audited
consolidated financial statements.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain non-GAAP measures and ratios, including Total Output, Gross Profit,
EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Trade Working Capital, Free Cash Flow, Change in Total Working Capital, Core Operating
Cash Generation, Cash Conversion, Capital Expenditures, Total Liabilities, Total Financial Debt, Net Financial Debt,
Contribution Margin as well as other pro forma data, including Pro Forma Senior Secured Debt, Pro Forma Senior Secured
Net Debt, Ratio of Pro Forma Senior Secured Debt to EBITDA and Ratio of Pro Forma Senior Secured Net Debt to
EBITDA to reflect certain effects of the Refinancing as if such Refinancing had occurred in (i) January 1, 2024, for purposes
of the calculation of income statement and cash flow items or (ii) December 31, 2023, for purposes of the calculation of
balance sheet items, that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, German GAAP.

We define “Total Output” as the sum of sales, increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process, other own work
capitalized and other operating income.


-----

We define “Gross Profit” as Total Output minus cost of materials.

We define “EBITDA” as sales, _plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process,_ _plus other own work_
capitalized, _plus other operating income,_ _minus cost of materials,_ _minus personnel expenses,_ _minus other operating_
expenses, plus net extraordinary expenses/(income) and minus other taxes.

We define “EBITDA Margin” as EBITDA divided by sales.

We define “Trade Working Capital” as inventories plus trade receivables, minus trade payables.

We define “Free Cash Flow” as cash flow from operating activities plus cash flows from investing activities.

We define “Change in Total Working Capital” as (increase)/decrease in inventories, trade receivables and other assets
_plus increase/(decrease) in trade payables and other liabilities between the respective periods as presented in the_
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.

We define “Core Operating Cash Generation” as as EBITDA minus Change in Total Working Capital.

We define “Cash Conversion” as Core Operating Cash Generation as a percentage of EBITDA.

We define “Capital Expenditures” as additions to tangible fixed assets plus additions to intangible fixed assets.

We define “Total Liabilities” as investment grants for fixed assets, plus provisions, plus liabilities, plus deferred income
_plus deferred tax libailities._

We define “Total Financial Debt” as bank loans _plus bonds,_ _minus other securities (i.e., Existing Notes we have_
repurchased and hold on balance sheet).

We define “Net Financial Debt” as Total Financial Debt minus cash-in-hand, bank balances.

We define “Contribution Margin” as sales, plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process, minus cost of
materials, minus freight expenses.

Our management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is helpful to investors because these and
other similar measures are widely used by certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties as supplemental
measures of performance and liquidity, among others.

We believe that EBITDA, EBITDA Margin and Cash Conversion are widely used by investors to measure our operating
performance and are useful metrics for evaluation of our operating performance and are useful metrics for evaluation of
our performance as they facilitate comparisons of our core operating results from period to period. In addition, we believe
Cash Conversion is useful as an indicator of our ability to convert EBITDA into available cash. EBITDA, EBITDA Margin
and Cash Conversion can vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, book value
of assets and capital structure or method by which assets were acquired. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in
performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net interest income/expense), tax positions (such as the
availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), and by the cost and age of tangible assets
(affecting the relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative
amortization expense).

We present Free Cash Flow because we believe this measure is useful to investors to understand the funds that we have
available before we have met our financial obligations.

We present Core Operating Cash Generation as a proxy for our ability to generate cash flow from our core operating
activities.

We present Capital Expenditures as we believe it is useful to assist investors to assess our investing activities.

However, you should not construe these non-GAAP measures as an alternative to net income or other items of our
Consolidated Income Statement determined in accordance with German GAAP, to cash flows from operating activities,
investing activities or financing activities or to liabilities or other balance sheet items of our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In addition, these non-GAAP measures and ratios presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used
by other companies and may have limitations as analytical tool. These non-GAAP measures have been provided for
informational purposes only and are not indicative of historical results, cash flows or liabilities nor are they meant to be
predictive of future results, cash flows or liabilities. Moreover, we have calculated, reconciled and presented certain of


-----

these non-GAAP measures, including in particular, Core Operating Cash Generation, by mathematically adding and/or
subtracting line items from our Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Cash Flow Statements and Consolidated
Balance Sheet, which, in each case, has not been prepared in compliance with the requirements under Regulation S-X
under the U.S. Securities Act or the Prospectus Regulation or the SEC or any other regulator. Investors are therefore put
on notice to treat these non-GAAP measures with caution.


-----

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We operate in an industry for which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information. Market data and certain
economic and industry data and forecasts used, and statements regarding our position in the industry made, in this offering
memorandum are based upon market research, government and other publicly available information, reports prepared by
independent industry consultants and independent industry publications. These include information published by RISI, Inc.
(“RISI”) and research by Vision Hunters Ltd. Oy (“Vision Hunters”). The information in this offering memorandum that
has been sourced from third parties has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from
the information published by such third parties, no facts have been omitted that we believe would render the reproduced
information inaccurate or misleading. While we believe the statements included in such third-party publications to be
reliable, they have not been independently verified, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or
warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this offering memorandum. Additionally,
industry publications and such reports generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources
believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances
state that they do not assume liability for such information. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our
_Business—The information available to market analysts varies in its degree of comparability”. Some industry publications_
publish or provide projections or other forward-looking statements that, by their very nature, involve inherent risks and
uncertainties and past projections or forward-looking statements have turned out to be inaccurate. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements”. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can therefore assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such_
information as we have not independently verified such information.

In addition, certain information in this offering memorandum regarding our industry and our market position is not based
on published statistical data or information obtained from independent third parties. Such information and statements reflect
our estimates based upon information obtained from trade and business organizations and associations and other contacts
within the industry in which we compete, internal surveys and assumptions we deem reasonable, as well as information
published by our competitors. To the extent that information in this offering memorandum is identified as being our belief,
that information is based on the following: (i) in respect of industry trends, our senior management’s general business
experience, as well as their experience in our industry and the markets in which we operate, and (ii) in respect of the
performance of our operations, our internal analysis of our audited and unaudited financial and other information. As some
of the foregoing information was compiled or provided by our management and is not publicly available, such information
accordingly may not be considered to be as independent as that provided by other third-party sources.

In this offering memorandum, all references to “euro”, “EUR” or “€” are to the single currency of the participating member
states of the European and Monetary Union of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, as amended from time to
time, and all references to “U.S. dollars” and “US$” are to the lawful currency of the United States of America. All

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum but does not contain all of the_
_information that you should consider before investing in the Notes. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by,_
_and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information and the financial statements appearing elsewhere_
_in this offering memorandum. You should read carefully the entire offering memorandum to understand our business, the_
_nature and terms of the Notes and the tax and other considerations which are important to your decision to invest in the_
_Notes, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”,_
_“Description of the Notes” and the risks discussed under the caption “Risk Factors”._

**OUR COMPANY**

We are a leading, family-owned producer and supplier of containerboard and corrugated board in Central Europe and are
headquartered in Landau, Germany. According to Vision Hunters, we are the third largest producer of corrugated board in
Europe (by production capacity) through our corrugated board business (“Board”) and the fifth largest producer of recycled
containerboard in Europe (by production capacity) through our containerboard business (“Paper”). We focus on the highly
efficient production and processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of corrugated board sheets
for our mostly family-owned box manufacturing customers. In this core market segment, we are the market leader by
volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands, according to Vision Hunters,
and following significant recent and ongoing investments, we have also been becoming a significant market player in Italy
and the United Kingdom. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated paper
and packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that bring added-value to our
customers in the packaging industry, i.e., the automated and integrated production of containerboard and corrugated board.
Our customers serve various end markets, including industrial/manufacturing, consumer durables, processed foods, nonfood manufactured consumer goods and fresh food. Unlike many fully integrated market players, we do not produce boxes
and therefore do not compete with our box manufacturing customers but instead focus solely on the production of
containerboard and corrugated board. We are part of the circular economy as the end products made with our corrugated
board and containerboard can serve as raw materials in our business after use by the end customer. In addition, we thermally
utilize foreign materials present in the recovered paper we use as a our main raw material as well as production residues
from our paper manufacturing processes in our waste-to-energy plant. This enables us to generate the steam required for
paper production at PM2 as well as a portion of our electricity requirements ourselves. In our paper mills, we almost
exclusively use recovered paper as a raw material for the production of containerboard. We use containerboard made from
recovered paper as much as possible in our corrugated board formats. This enables us to reduce the use of virgin fiber paper
(kraftliner) and thereby the amount of virgin pulp used in the production of our corrugated board.

Through our large scale and highly flexible production, built up primarily via a greenfield approach and, more recently,
via packaging park projects, we are able to realize significant economies of scale. Since we commenced operations in 1992,
we have carefully selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a
greenfield strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we operate.
As a result, we believe we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high technological standards,
resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and relatively low requirements for additional
capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the high technological standards of our production facilities, we
believe we are well-positioned to benefit from major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for light

**OUR STRENGTHS**

We believe we benefit from the following competitive strengths.

**Differentiated business model with leading market positions in attractive market environment**

Our founder and vice chairman of our Supervisory Board, Jürgen Heindl, designed a business model differentiating us
from our competitors. Through our strategic value chain positioning in containerboard and corrugated board production
only, we do not compete with our targeted customers, who are primarily family-owned, small- and medium-sized
businesses. Our core customers focus on packaging solutions for the end-customer and typically do not have their own
corrugated board production capability. Many of our competitors are fully integrated and focus on serving larger endcustomers in large batch sizes, including global consumer corporates. Our differentiated business model allows us to serve
a higher number of customers, process a higher number of orders and maintain higher production volumes per production
site (up to 450 million square meters of corrugated board per annum), thereby generating economies of scale. We are solely
focused on the production process as opposed to many of our competitors, who also focus on more complex and customerspecific packaging requirements for a smaller number of larger customers and, hence, only have an average production
output of typically 80 to 90 million square meters per production site per annum.

In 32 years since our foundation, we have achieved leading market positions in the countries in which we operate. We are
among the top three corrugated board producers in Europe (by production capacity) and our market share in our specific
segment, the corrugated sheet market in Europe, was approximately 19% according to February 2024 market research by
Vision Hunters. In our core market segment, namely corrugated board sheets, we were the market leader by volumes sold
in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands, according to Vision Hunters, and we hold
considerably higher market shares in those markets compared to our position in the overall European containerboard and
corrugated board market. In Germany, we have been further expanding our leading market position in recent years with (i)
the start of production at a new corrugated board plant (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with an annual corrugated board
production capacity of approximately 135,000 tons, in November 2019, (ii) the start of production at our third and newest
paper machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, with an annual capacity of approximately 750,000 tons of
containerboard, in August 2020, (iii) the ongoing construction of a new corrugated board “mega plant” (PW15) in
Petersberg, Germany, with an expected annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons and
test production expected to commence in the first half of 2024, as a packaging park project right next door to our longstanding customer and partner G&G Preißer, and (iv) the start of construction of a new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) at
the site of PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, to supply our paper machine PM3 with the required process heat as well as
electricity.

We have also become market leader in the Polish market, following the start of production at our corrugated board
production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland in 2017 and the start of commercial production in January 2023 and ongoing
ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14), with an annual corrugated board production capacity of
approximately 200,000 tons, right next to our earlier corrugated board plant (PW7) in Strykow, Poland. Similarly, we have
also become a significant player in the UK market, following the commencement of production in January 2019 and
subsequent ramp-up at our corrugated board “mega plant” (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, with an annual
corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, which replaced the much smaller and
decommissioned production site PW8. In addition, the commencement of production at our corrugated board production
site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in March 2018, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately
135,000 tons, marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. We also commenced construction
of a further corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy in the fourth quarter of 2023 and expect production
to commence at the new site in the first half of 2025. In the corrugated sheet market, we had a market share of approximately
19% in 2022 in Europe, according to the February 2024 market research by Vision Hunters.

While we believe our differentiated business model, high reliability and quality of product supply, significant scale, internal
sourcing and geographic coverage provide us with a competitive advantage in our core market segment, we also benefit
from attractive market fundamentals of the overall industry.

Over many years, the paper and packaging industry has experienced overall growing demand from industrial economies in
Central Europe, and we believe that Germany and Central Europe, our key markets, generally provide a positive economic
outlook. The last two years have been slightly negatively impacted by softness in containerboard and corrugated board
demand as well as destocking trends. However, structural growth trends such as rising urbanization, increasing demand for
convenience (i.e., take-aways and home deliveries) or sustainability awareness should drive the demand recovery expected
by RISI and Vision Hunters in the next 4 to 5 years, as mentioned under “Industry and Competition”. From a product
perspective, the increasing significance of light-weight paper and packaging solutions as well as small-size packaging and
the increasingly online and mail order-driven retail sector is expected to further stimulate packaging growth. We believe
our modern production facilities, particularly PM2, which is capable of producing light-weight paper grades economically
on a commercial scale, and PM3, which is one of world’s largest and most modern and high-performance paper mills,


-----

position us well to benefit from these growth trends in the industry. Furthermore, production is driven by the strong increase
in demand from emerging economies, where production and packaging standards are adapting to the standards of developed
countries, from which we also benefit with our production in Poland and the Czech Republic.

**Uniquely designed, best-in-class and strategically located, low-cost production asset base built up via greenfield**
**strategy**

Since our foundation in 1991, we have carefully designed and selected our production operations and locations via a
dedicated greenfield strategy to establish highly efficient, flexible and technologically advanced production facilities. We
believe we continue to be the fastest organically growing corrugated board producer in Europe and have developed a unique
track record and expertise in successfully establishing new greenfield corrugated board production sites. This includes a
dedicated and experienced in-house projects team tasked with identifying attractive market opportunities for profitable
growth, completing the planning and construction phases of the relevant projects on time and on budget and managing fast
and successful ramp-ups of production at the relevant sites.

Designing our production set-up primarily via a greenfield strategy allowed us to invest in the best available production
specifications and optimize the alignment and compatibility of our paper machines, PM1, PM2 and PM3, with our
corrugators. The current 2.5m, 2.8m and 3.3m trim widths of our various existing corrugated board plants can be very
efficiently combined with the 5.8m trim width of PM1 (2 × 2.8m or 2.5m + 3.3m), the 10.2m trim width of PM2 (4 × 2.5m
or 3 × 3.3m) and the 9.2m trim width of our newest paper machine PM3 (2 × 3.3m + 2.5m or 2 × 2.8m + 3.3m), resulting
in low volumes of cutting scrap and higher productivity.

Our corrugated board production sites have been purposefully located approximately 500 kilometers from each other. This
footprint ensures close customer proximity with full regional coverage of our customers and limited overlap to limit the
transportation distance in most circumstances to 250 to 300 kilometers. Our strategic footprint also allows us to achieve
high production flexibility and reliable just-in-time delivery with short lead times. Furthermore, we are able to serve our
customers from different locations, thereby optimizing transportation costs and capacity utilizations on a plant-by-plant
basis, which is coordinated centrally from our headquarters in Landau following a “one mill approach”. We believe our
location layout and organization give us a competitive advantage in terms of cost efficiency and customer orientation. On
average, we serve approximately 50 to 80 customers per corrugated board production site and each of our production sites
offers the entire range of customer services (e.g., 24 hour delivery and online ordering and tracking).

We believe that all of our plants are equipped with state-of-the-art technology, which is the foundation of our low-cost and
efficient production. According to Vision Hunters, the asset quality of our paper machines is characterized as high and
above comparable European containerboard and corrugated board producers. Performance metrics of PM1, such as
capacity and technical age, are well above the industry average. PM2, which we believe to be among the world’s most
advanced paper machines for recycled super-light-weight paper and which specializes in the production of super-lightweight to medium-weight containerboard with grammages of 60 to 130g/m[2], ranks best in class for all metrics and has set
six new world records since its launch in 2010. PM3 is not only one of the world’s most modern and high-performance
paper machines for manufacturing environmentally friendly and high-quality containerboard, but also one of the world’s
largest paper factories.

Unlike many of our competitors, who grew historically over many decades or had to integrate production infrastructures
inorganically through acquisitions, we differentiate ourselves through our well-invested asset base and high-quality,
complementary, modern and strictly aligned, high capacity production facilities placed purposefully in strategic locations.

**Strong, diversified and long-standing customer base**

We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, some of which date back to the start of our operations
in 1992. We have grown with our large German customers as they have expanded across Europe and have successfully
entered into new relationships with key customers outside of Germany. We currently supply 350 to 400 different Board
customers, with a strategic focus on family-owned, small and medium-sized companies. Our top five Board customers
accounted only for approximately 6%, 5%, 5%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of our total corrugated board sales, by tons, in
2023, while our top five external Paper customers accounted for approximately 15%, 9%, 6%, 5% and 4%, respectively,
of our total external containerboard sales, by tons, in 2023.

We believe that our ability to provide reliable delivery of high-quality, cost-effective and tailor-made products and being
a family-owned business have enabled us to foster strong partnerships of mutual dependence with our mostly family-owned
customers, operating as a fundamental part of their supply chains by improving inventory management, security of supply
and customer service.

Our strong customer relationships are reinforced through a combination of our geographic reach, our manufacturing and
logistics excellence, and the limited availability of alternative suppliers with the capacity and geographic proximity to


-----

provide a competitive offering. At a number of our corrugated board production sites, certain long-standing customers have
established their own box manufacturing plants in immediate proximity to our site, either on our own land or on land
adjacent to our site (so-called “Packaging Park 1 Model”). As a variation of this original packaging park model, we
commenced production in October 2015 at our corrugated board production site (PW09) in Plössberg, Germany, which we
established in immediate proximity to an existing packaging plant of our customer, Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk, on land
owned by our customer. As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced production in the first quarter
of 2017 at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we purchased from our large customer
Janmar Centrum adjacent to its existing packaging plant. We refer to these variations where we establish our own
corrugated board production sites close to our customers as the “Packaging Park 2 Model”. Following the success of
these two packaging park projects (PW09 and PW10), we also established our corrugated board production site (PW11) in
Drizzona, Italy as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of our customer, Italian
packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l., and we are currently constructing yet another new corrugated board plant (PW15)
in Petersberg, Germany, with test production expected to commence in the first half of 2024, right next door to our longstanding customer and partner G&G Preißer. The next corrugated board plant (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy, which is expected
to commence test production in 2025, is being built next door to our customer Ondulkart.

All versions of the packaging park model help us to further strengthen our relationships with key customers or win
significant new customers (as in the case of Imbal Carton S.r.l. in 2018) and benefit both us and the relevant customers.
The high level of integration between our own corrugated board production and the box production of our customers
allowed by the packaging park model creates a number of efficiencies and largely eliminates freight and other freight
expenses between Board and our packaging park customers. This business model does not require pallets, simplifying the
delivery process. Our packaging park customers also typically purchase almost all of their corrugated board requirements
for the relevant box plant from us, which ensures predictable, high volume orders and consistently high utilization levels
for the relevant corrugated board production sites. Index pricing arrangements with our packaging park customers further
ensure a predictable pricing mechanism for all parties. It typically takes approximately two to three months for
containerboard mills to pass on their raw material price increases to their customers, _i.e.,_ manufacturers of corrugated
board. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard cost
increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for corrugated board manufacturers, including us, to pass
these increases on to their customers, although the extent and speed with which we are able to pass on cost increases to our
customers, if at all, can vary significantly, depending on prevailing market conditions.

**High-tech, operating with the most advanced containerboard and machinery to lead in innovation and sustainability**

There are general industry trends towards lighter and more functional packaging and towards a more efficient use of
resources. The trend towards “light paper” (i.e., containerboard) has been particularly strong in Germany and has been
further strengthened by the increasingly online and mail order-driven retail sector, which is expected to further stimulate
demand growth for light packaging solutions. From a sustainability point of view, many end consumers are increasingly
asking for optimized packaging (avoiding over-packaging) and lighter packaging (only as much packaging as necessary),
which also requires suitable lightweight containerboard grades. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to
capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany, which specializes in the production of superlight-weight to medium-weight containerboard with grammages of 60 to 130g/m[2]. As demand for super-light-weight
containerboard (with a grammage below 90g/m[2]) is increasing, we believe that PM2 gives us a significant advantage over


-----

many of our competitors, both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Our newest paper machine PM3, on the other
hand, is designed to provide standard containerboard grades with grammages of 90 to 130g/m². Since this newest paper
machine commenced operation in August 2020, it has given us the ability to put an even stronger focus on the production
of super-light-weight containerboard (i.e., 70 to 80g/m[2]) at PM2 and to focus production at PM1 on specialty
containerboard such as kraftliner substitutes and containerboard with a higher grammages above 130g/m². We believe that
this added specialization of our paper machines has further enhanced the productivity of all our paper machines as each
paper mill is now able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. For more detail, see also “—Our Strategy—Maintain
_and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled investments”_
below.

In addition, we continuously work to improve our product designs, optimize the utilization of our assets and explore new
ways to further reduce our input costs and secure the long-term sustainability of our core businesses, both from an economic
and environmental perspective. In particular, we are focused on further reducing the use of fiber (i.e., recovered paper) in
our products as well as the amount of energy required for our production processes and the shipment of our products, in
order to both maintain a competitive cost position in our industry and to reduce emissions and waste.

We believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001, our paper machine PM1 was the world’s technologically most advanced
containerboard paper machine, setting new technology standards, including with the use of a closed water cycle, thereby
minimizing the creation of waste water. Launched in 2010, we believe that PM2 remains among the world’s most advanced
paper machines, which we believe has allowed us to set new industry standards with respect to raw material efficiency. As
described in more detail under “—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated
_board producer in Europe through controlled investments” below, we further decided to make certain significant additional_
investments in connection with the establishment of our newest paper machine (PM3). We believe these investments will
result in significant cost savings in the mid- to long-term as well as significant reductions of CO2 emissions, waste water
and natural gas consumption. These investments include a state-of-the-art overall waste-heat concept as well as a “first-ofits-kind” closed cycle waste water treatment system, and we have also commenced construction of a new waste-to-energy
plant at our site in Sandersdorf-Brehna, to supply PM3 with the majority of the required process heat as well as a significant
portion of the required electricity.

We have further invested significantly in the development of a “green” range of “next generation” products working in
close cooperation with BHS Corrugated GmbH, one of our equipment suppliers, and a team of researchers at the University
of Applied Sciences (Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften) in Regensburg, Germany. We market these products
under our own brands next fibre[®], next board[®] and next box[®]. All of these product innovations involve the use of superlight-weight containerboard produced by our paper machine PM2 as well as innovative flute designs of our corrugated
board formats, intended to further reduce raw material input and thereby further reduce weight, input costs and CO2
emissions.

**Significant synergies through high degree of vertical integration**

In 2023, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for approximately 76% of the containerboard, by volume, used by
our corrugated board production within Board. As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production
capacity over the years, internal containerboard sales to Board had increased steadily from approximately 71% (or 83%, if
we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to
approximately 87% (or 96%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume,
of Paper in 2019. This meant that we had accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been
operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board
and had even temporarily become a net purchaser of containerboard, i.e., the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements
of our corrugated board production within Board significantly exceeded the internal supply capacities of Paper.

With the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up at our third and newest paper machine (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, with an annual capacity of approximately 750,000 tons of containerboard, the volume of
our external containerboard sales significantly increased again. As a result, internal containerboard sales to Board decreased
to approximately 82% (or 92%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by
volume, of Paper in 2020, approximately 75% (or 87%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2021 and
approximately 75% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2022. Due to the further ramp-up of
PM3, internal containerboard sales to Board as a percentage of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper remained
fairly stable at approximately 74% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2023. We expect that
(i) the start of production in January 2023 and ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in
Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, (ii) the expected
start of test production in the first half of 2024 and subsequent ramp-up at our proposed corrugated board “mega plant”
(PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, and (iii) our further proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy
alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we expect to be
operating again at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and


-----

Board and again become a net purchaser of containerboard in the mid-term. For more details on our expansion projects and
investment program, see also “—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated
_board producer in Europe through controlled investments” below. With an envisaged total annual containerboard capacity_
of approximately 1,850,000 tons, Paper produced approximately 1,574,000 tons and 1,607,000 tons of containerboard in
2023 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, approximately 1,153,000 tons were sold internally to Board (2021: 1,187,000 tons
of internal containerboard sales), and a further approximately 163,000 tons were sold pursuant to swap agreements with
other containerboard producers (2021: 194,000 tons of sales to swap partners), which allow us to reduce transportation
costs, optimize our production program and swap internally produced containerboard for certain containerboard grades we
do not produce in sufficient quantities, such as kraftliner. The remaining approximately 241,000 tons of containerboard we
sold in 2023 were sold externally (2021: approximately 206,000 tons of external containerboard sales, excluding sales to
swap partners). With a total annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,815,000 tons (including
200,000 tons of capacity of our new corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, which commenced
commercial production in January 2023, but excluding a further 200,000 tons of capacity of our proposed corrugated board
“mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, which is expected to commence production in the second quarter of 2024)
(2021: total annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,615,000 tons), Board produced approximately
1,494,000 tons of containerboard in 2023, compared to approximately 1,504,000 tons of corrugated board in 2021. We
believe that a high degree of vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently highquality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. At the
same time, we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or improve our overall
Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared to corrugated board margins) of
certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, justin-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options. The steady increase in the degree of vertical integration between
Paper and Board over the last few years has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply
chain. See also “—Our Strategy—Achieving further cost-savings and efficiency improvements through further increased
_external containerboard purchases” below._

**Strong track-record of organic profitable growth supported by accretive expansion projects**

Since 2015, we successfully completed a number of recent expansion and other investment projects, including the
acquisiton of our waste-to-energy plant at the site of PM2 in Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany as well as the successful
establishment of six new corrugated board plants (PW09, PW10, PW11, PW12, PW13 and PW14) and our third and newest
paper machine PM3. Furthermore, we initiated additional investment projects with the construction of a new waste-toenergy plant (PPO2) at the site of PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany and the construction of our new corrugated board
plant (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, which are both progressing on schedule as well as the construction for yet another
corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy having started in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, we
successfully implemented a series of initiatives in recent years as part of our Continuous Improvement Program to improve
the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities, optimize (i.e., minimize) our variable costs and stabilize our specific
fixed costs in order to achieve sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost leaders in the recycled
containerboard market.

As a result of these and other factors, and notwithstanding the significant challenges and uncertainties we faced due to the
COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine in recent years, we have managed to continue to deliver consistently strong
profitability and cash generation, and continued to move the Group to a structurally enhanced level of profitability. In
particular, we have managed to deliver EBITDA of €152.9 million in 2015, €154.7 million in 2016, €180.4 million in 2017,
€275.5 million in 2018, €223,2 million in 2019, €178.1 million in 2020, €273.2 million in 2021, €412.0 million in 2022
and €200.8 million in 2023. Combined with our controlled investment strategy, which should normally allow us to adapt
the amount of our expansion capital expenditures in line with our projected mid-term cash requirement, we believe we are
in a strong financial condition to weather and/or adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole.

**Committed family shareholders and experienced management team for long-term stability**

Our company was founded in 1991 by Jürgen Heindl, who continues to serve as vice-chairman of our Supervisory Board
and controls our company with his two sons, Maximilian Heindl, our chief executive officer, and Vinzenz Heindl. We
believe this family link and the strong personal and long-standing financial commitment of our owners ensure our focus
on stability, long-term value generation and prudent investment strategies. After 30 years at the helm of the Group, Jürgen
Heindl handed over the leadership of the Group to his son and former deputy, Maximilian Heindl, effective January 1,
2023, but we continue to benefit from Jürgen Heindl’s expertise and experience in his role as vice-chairman of the
Supervisory Board. After gaining several years of relevant work and management experience in the paper industry outside
the Group, Maximilian Heindl joined the Group in August 2016 as the manager in charge of production and technology at
Paper (PM1 and PM2) and with overall responsibility for Power. From August 1, 2017, Maximilian Heindl took over
further responsibility within the Group as a deputy member of the Executive Board. Effective January 1, 2019, he became
a regular member of the Executive Board and assumed the role of chief development officer, responsible, among other
things, for overseeing the planning, construction and commissioning of our newest paper machine PM3. On July 1, 2021,
he assumed the role of deputy chief executive officer before becoming our chief executive officer on January 1, 2023.
Maximilian Heindl’s work and management experience outside the Group, his management roles at Paper and Power, his
appointment to the Executive Board and gradual assumption of further responsibilities were all part of a deliberate, longterm succession plan of our founder and former chief executive officer Jürgen Heindl, with the goal of securing our future
as a successful family-owned business into the next generation.

In response to the increasing size and complexity of the Group and to free up management capacity, we have further
professionalized and expanded our senior management team, including our Executive Board. Dr. Volker Metz rejoined the
Group as our chief financial officer in November 2016, after previously having served as our head of controlling between
2009 and 2016. Dr. Marc Sesterhenn joined the Group as our chief operations officer in October 2023, and our Supervisory
Board has further appointed Beate Flamm as chief culture and communication officer and fourth member of our Executive
Board effective May 1, 2024, when she is expected to assume, amongst other areas, responsibility for human resources as
well internal and external communication. Jürgen Heindl’s, Maximilian Heindl’s, Volker Metz’s, Marc Sesterhenn’s and
Beate Flamm’s expertise are supported by a strong management team with extensive industry experience, also within our
Group. Our management team has impressively demonstrated its abilities to create one of Europe’s leading containerboard
and corrugated board players while withstanding economic downturns and restructurings and striving through periods of
significant uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility and uncertainty created by the Russian invasion
of Ukraine.

**Sustainable Company in the Circular Economy**

Progroup’s products are shining examples of the circular economy. We only ever use recovered paper as the raw material
for our containerboard. The end product is also a recyclable product because at the end of its life the corrugated board is
largely processed through waste separation and reused throughout Europe. Our production processes also follow the
concept of a cycle: we produce energy from production residues and waste materials in our waste-to-energy plant in


-----

Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany. Our water loops are closed on two of our three paper machines, and we recycle corrugated
board rejects back into the production cycle as a raw material used for papermaking.

The process of producing containerboard uses a lot of water. In our paper mills, we utilize water not only in the production
process, for example for breaking down recovered paper, but also for cooling and cleaning the facilities. To reduce the
level of consumption, we operate closed water cycles on two of our three paper machines (PM1 in Burg and PM3 in
Sandersdorf-Brehna). This means that there is no wastewater from production on these two machines, and on PM3 waste
water only comes from ancillary systems alongside the paper machine. These technologies are unique in our industry. This
has enabled us in recent years to significantly reduce the amount of fresh water we require for each ton of total output.
Compared to 2012, the reduction by 2021 was around 37% and by 2022 was around 34%. This slight increase in the specific
water consumption is attributable primarily to the increased amount of water used at our combined heat and power plant
compared to the previous year. By 2030, we aim to achieve a reduction in the specific amount of fresh water per ton of
total output by 40%.

Climate neutrality is a major challenge for Progroup, as it is for many other manufacturing companies. In Germany, the
paper industry is one of the three most energy-intensive industries. Although less energy is required for producing
recovered paper than for fresh fiber paper, our company is still to a large degree energy-dependent. The final drying of the
containerboard is done using steam, whose production consumes a lot of energy. In 2022, our total emissions were at
roughly the same level as the previous year despite our growth. We also continuously optimise our facilities. This allows
us to utilise steam and heating energy more efficiently. At the same time, the most effective lever at present for reducing
costs and emissions is to operate waste-to energy plants. Using substitute fuels also allows us to reduce the amount of gas
we use. By 2025 we want to reduce our specific emissions – relative to our total output of containerboard and corrugated
board sheets – by 35%. By 2030 the new power plant in Sandersdorf-Brehna should help us to achieve a saving of 40%.

**OUR STRATEGY**

**Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through**
**controlled investments**

To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe in the longterm and to allow us to successfully meet expected future market growth and the requirements of our customers with regard
to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand
and improve the efficiency of our production facilities as part of our long-term “Two Twentyfive” strategy, as long as
(i) we are confident we can achieve payback periods for our investments that are aligned with the maturity profile and
relevant headroom under our financing arrangements, (ii) we maintain sufficient financial flexibility to weather and/or
adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole, and (iii) any such investments would be consistent with
our long-term target leverage. In addition to further capacity expansion, our “Two Twentyfive” strategy, among other
things, also contemplates a gradual technological transition and generation change away from the use of corrugators with
a trim width of 2.5m, which are installed and currently in use at some of our older corrugated board production sites, to the
use of more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our corrugated board production sites.


-----

With the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up at our third and newest paper machine (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, we became a significant net seller of containerboard again. In the short- to mid-term, we
therefore intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production
capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market opportunities for profitable growth, similar to
those that led to the successful establishment of six new corrugated board plants (PW09, PW10, PW11, PW12, PW13 and
PW14) in Plössberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland), Drizzona (Italy), Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom), Eisfeld
(Germany) and Strykow (Poland) since 2015. We expect that (i) the start of commercial production in January 2023 and
the ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated
board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, (ii) the expected start of test production in the first half of 2024
and subsequent ramp-up at our proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, and (iii) our
further proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy alone will lead to a significant further increase
in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we expect to be operating again at the top end of our long-term target
corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board and again become a net purchaser of
containerboard in the mid-term. With the proposed additional corrugated board plants (PW15 and PW16) in Petersberg,
Germany and Cessalto, Italy, we expect our annual corrugated board production capacity to increase from currently
approximately 1,815,000 tons to approximately 2,215,000 tons.

In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we intend to achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion
opportunities via greenfield projects. However, as with our corrugated board production sites (PW03) in Burg, (PW05) in
Schüttorf, (PW06) in Offenbach a.d. Queich and (PW09) in Plössberg, Germany, our corrugated board production sites
(PW10) in Trzcinica and (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, our production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy and our production
site (PW12 ) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, we are also establishing our proposed new corrugated board production
site (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of
one of our customers, German packaging specialist G&G Preißer, allowing us to supply that long-standing partner largely
without freight and other freight expenses. Our latest corrugated board project (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy will also be
established in immediate vicinity to an existing packaging customer as a packaging park.

While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including in connection with the ten packaging park
projects (PW03, PW05, two packaging park customers at PW06, PW09, PW10, PW11, PW12, PW13 and PW14) and the
proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW15 and PW16) in Germany and Italy, we are also evaluating and will
continue to evaluate opportunities to find partners to leverage the benefits of a packaging park that would enrich our existing
network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our corrugated board production capacity and meet the
other internal investment and financing criteria described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our
relationships with certain large and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with
significant new customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated
board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers. We currently expect to make
total investments of approximately €246 million into the two proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW15 and
PW16) in Germany and Italy. With an expected combined annual incremental corrugated board production capacity for
PW15 and PW16 of approximately 400,000 tons of corrugated board, an average net selling price per ton of corrugated
board of €756.1 per ton in 2023 and historic EBITDA margins for Board in the high single digit to low double digit range,
we believe PW15 and PW16 to be able to make a sizable contribution to EBITDA following completion of both projects.
Historically, our new corrugated board production sites have typically achieved a capacity utilization level of around 90%
within 3 to 5 years of start of operation.

In the first quarter of 2023, we also started construction of a new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) next to PM3 in SandersdorfBrehna, to supply our newest paper machine with the required process steam as well as electricity. We currently expect to
make total investments of approximately €190 million, with a target completion date towards mid 2025.

**Maintain cost leadership through continuous efficiency and profitability improvements**

In order to maintain profitability throughout the economic cycle, we have been running a comprehensive profitability
improvement program for many years (the “Continuous Improvement Program”) to ensure the long-term success of our
Group. Our Continuous Improvement Program focuses on (i) improving the effectiveness of our sales and marketing
activities, (ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and (iii) stabilizing our specific fixed costs in order to achieve
sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost leaders in the recycled containerboard market. Since 2012,
our main focus in connection with our goal of achieving sales excellence has been on (i) growing our external sales in
excess of the general growth in market volumes (and thereby increasing our market share), (ii) maximizing the impact of
the introduction of our “next generation” products into the market and (iii) optimizing our sales portfolio. As part of our
efforts to optimize our variable costs, we have focused on (i) reducing our consumption of raw materials, (ii) optimizing
our energy consumption and energy costs (including as a result of the cost savings we believe to generate form the operation
of our new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) next to PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna), and (iii) reducing the purchase prices of
our key production factors, such as recovered paper, starch and freight services. Overall, we have met or exceeded our


-----

targeted benefits through our Continuous Improvement Program. We intend to continue to implement our Continuous
Improvement Program and identify and realize further improvement opportunities.

**MARKET AND TRADING UPDATE**

**Market Update**

We experienced increasing volumes at the start of 2024, especially in Poland and the DACH region, a trend we expect to
continue throughout the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we see further potential for volume growth in the United
Kingdom.

The most recent information available to us from third party sources regarding operating rates in the European
containerboard industry also indicate an improvement in the first two months of 2024. At the same time, stock levels of
containerboard in the industry have been decreasing and were well below the values of the prior year.

After a small price decrease in the containerboard market in January, prices remained stable in February. We understand
that all major players in the European containerboard industry, including us, have announced price increases of
approximately €70 to €80 per ton for either March or April 2024. According to a containerboard price index, approximately
€50 to €60 per ton of these announced price increases have already been implemented in March 2024. We expect to pass
on these containerboard price increases to our corrugated board customers with the typical time lag.

**Trading Update**

Based on management accounts, our operating performance for the month of January 2024 showed a strong corrugated
board volume increase of 4.7% compared to January 2023, supported by (i) the successful and ongoing ramp-up following
the commencement of commercial production at our latest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland in
January 2023, and (ii) increasing sales volumes in Italy and the United Kingdom. The volume of externally sold
containerboard also increased by 18.8% compared to the prior year period. Sales prices for both corrugated board and
containerboard further decreased compared to January 2023, which resulted in an approximately 19.5% decrease in sales
from approximately €140.4 million in January 2023 to approximately €113.0 million in January 2024. Our EBITDA
decreased from €31.8 million in January 2023 to approximately €12.8 million in January 2024.

The foregoing operating and financial information is based on management information and internal unaudited
consolidated monthly accounts for the month of January 2023 and 2024, respectively, which were prepared by and are the
responsibility of our management. This financial information has not been audited, reviewed, compiled, examined or the
subject of any procedures by our independent auditors, PwC, or any other independent auditors and no opinion nor any
other form of assurance is expressed with respect thereto. PwC assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association
with, the unaudited preliminary financial information. The foregoing financial information is inherently subject to
modification during the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the three months ending March 31, 2024. The
presented financial information is not representative for any three-month or twelve-month period and should not be
regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other person regarding our future financial performance
for the three months ending March 31, 2024 or the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. See “Forward-Looking
_Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a more complete discussion of certain factors that could affect our future performance_
and results of operations.

**THE REFINANCING**

The “Refinancing” refers to the issuance of €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes pursuant to the Offering
and the use of a portion of the proceeds from the Offering (i) to redeem in full the €600,000,000 outstanding principal
amount of the Existing Notes on or about       , 2024, and (ii) to pay costs, fees and expenses related to the Refinancing,
including underwriting fees and commissions, commitment, placement, financial advisory and other transaction costs and
professional fees.

We further expect to use a portion of the proceeds from the Offering to finance our proposed investments into the proposed
new corrugated board production sites (PW15 and PW16) in Germany and Italy, with a combined expected total annual
incremental corrugated board production capacity of 400,000 tons, and the proposed new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2)
next to PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. For more details see“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and_

**OVERVIEW OF OUR CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE**

The following diagram depicts, in simplified form, our corporate and financing structure adjusted to give effect to the
Refinancing as set forth under “Use of Proceeds and the full utilization of all our Senior Secured Facilities as if they had
occurred on the Issue Date. All company ownership is 100% unless otherwise indicated. For a summary of our material
financing arrangements, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes”.

(1) 91.05% of the registered share capital of the Issuer are being held by JH-Holding, a holding company controlled by our founder and vicechairman Jürgen Heindl who holds a qualified majority of more than 75% of the voting rights in the shareholders’ meeting of JH Holding.
The remaining 8.95% of the registered share capital of the Issuer are being held by our four minority shareholders who are not involved in the
management of our business. Pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement, the four minority shareholders have completely submitted their voting
rights to the voting of the majority, which is held by JH-Holding. As a result, the four minority shareholders are not able to influence the
composition of the Supervisory Board. For more details about our shareholders and their related voting rights, see “Shareholders” below. The
shares of the Issuer held by JH-Holding and our four minority shareholders will be included as part of the Collateral as of the Issue Date,
although the Conditions of Issue will provide that the Security Agent will, at the request of the Issuer, a Guarantor or another security provider,
release the Liens over the shares of the Issuer (without requiring the consent of the Holders’ Representative or the Holders), upon the release
and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) over such shares, so long as
no Event of Default exists at such time or would arise as a result of such release. See “Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release
_of Collateral”._


-----

(2) The Issuer is offering €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Notes pursuant to this offering memorandum.

(3) The Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors. All obligations under
the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements are, and, upon issuance of the Notes, the Notes will be, secured by the Collateral, which also secures
certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Liabilities, although any liabilities in respect of obligations under certain potential
future Super Senior Credit Facilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Priority Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management
Liabilities will receive priority over those of the Holders. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”.
As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors accounted, on a consolidated basis, for 88.4% of our
consolidated revenues (effects of intragroup transactions eliminated), approximately 98% of our EBITDA (effects of intragroup transactions
eliminated) and approximately 95% of our consolidated total assets (effects of intragroup relations eliminated). The Guarantors’ obligations
in respect of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and the Notes may be released in certain circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral and the Guarantees_
_may be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Holders’ Representative”, “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Release of Note Guarantees”._

(4) On July 24, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which provides for up
to €200.0 million of committed credit that may be drawn by certain members of the Group specified therein from time to time. As of the Issue
Date, we expect the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement to remain undrawn. The obligations of the borrowers under the
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Issuer and the Guarantors and are secured by the
same Collateral that secures the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and, upon issuance of the Notes, the Notes, on a pari passu basis. The
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an uncommitted “accordion feature” which gives us the option to increase the
total commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from currently €200,000,000 to up to €250,000,000. For
more details, see “Summary—The Refinancing”, “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Revolving Credit
_Facility” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

(5) The obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities are, and,
upon issuance of the Notes, the Notes and related Guarantees will be, secured by first-priority security interests over (i) the shares of the Issuer,
Progroup Board S.A.S. and each Guarantor; (ii) certain real property; (iii) certain bank accounts of the Issuer; and (iv) certain fixed and other
assets (collectively, the “Collateral”). For further details on the Collateral, see “Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release of
_Collateral”. The Collateral will be subject to certain significant contractual and legal limitations or subject to certain defenses under applicable_
law, as described under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations
_on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Certain_
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”. Pursuant to the_
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts received or recovered in respect of enforcement of all or any part of the Collateral are required
to be turned over to the Security Agent and, subject to the payment of fees and expenses of the Holders’ Representative, certain other creditor
representatives and the Security Agent, paid by the Security Agent first to the discharge in full of the obligations under certain potential future
“Super Senior Credit Facilities” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities
and second to the discharge in full of the obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, and, upon issuance of the Notes, the
Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. The security interests may be released under certain
circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under
_which the Collateral and the Guarantees may be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Holders’ Representative”,_

_Collateral”._

(6) On December 21, 2017, the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors entered into the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement. The Senior Secured
IKB Facilities Agreement originally provided for a €8.5 million Facility A and a €30.0 million Facility B, which we have fully utilized.
However, as of December 31, 2018, the amount repayable under Facility A was reduced to €7.155 million as a result of a €1.345 million
repayment grant. Both facilities are being repaid in accordance with the terms of each facility. As of December 31, 2023, €2.640 million and
€15.0 million, respectively, were outstanding under Facility A and Facility B. For more details about the Senior Secured IKB Facilities
Agreement, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement”.

(7) On July 13, 2018, to fund a portion of the expected investment into the establishment of our newest paper mill (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna,
Germany, the Issuer and certain of the Guarantors entered into (i) an amendment and restatement agreement relating to the Senior Secured

original principal amount of any Additional 2029 Notes) using the net proceeds
from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to % of the

Amounts, if any; provided that at least 65% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional
2029 Notes) remains outstanding after the redemption. See “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption—2029 Notes”._

_2031 Notes:_

The Issuer may redeem all or part of the 2031 Notes at any time on or after March

**Additional Amounts .............** Any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with
respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made without withholding or
deduction for or on account of any taxes in any relevant taxing jurisdiction unless
required by law. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, if the Issuer or
applicable Guarantor or paying agent is required by law to withhold or deduct such
taxes with respect to a payment on any Note or Guarantee, the Issuer or applicable
Guarantor will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount
received after such withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that would
have been received in the absence of the withholding or deduction. See
“Description of the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts”.

**Tax Redemption ...................** If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction become effective
after the issuance of the Notes that would impose withholding taxes on the
payments on the Notes and would require the Issuer or any Guarantor to pay
Additional Amounts (as described in “Description of the Notes—Payment of
_Additional Amounts”), the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part,_
at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued

the date of redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Early Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons”._


-----

**Change of Control ................** If the Issuer experiences a change of control (as defined in the Conditions of Issue),
the Holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to offer to
repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount,
_plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if_
any, to the date of repurchase. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the
_Option of Holders upon a Change of Control”._

**Certain Covenants ...............** The Conditions of Issue will limit, among other things, the ability of the Issuer and

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if and for as long as we achieve
investment grade ratings. See “Description of the Notes—Covenants—Suspension
_of Covenants”. Each of the covenants in the Conditions of Issue will be subject to_

**Transfer Restrictions ...........** The Notes or the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under U.S.
federal or state or any foreign securities laws and are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See “Transfer Restrictions”. We are under no obligation
to, nor do we intend to, register the Notes or the Guarantees in the United States.


**Absence of a Public Market for**
**the Notes ...............................**


The Notes will be new securities for which there is no established trading market.
Although the Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make
a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue
market-making at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you as
to the development or liquidity of any market for the Notes. Furthermore, the Notes
will not have registration rights under the U.S. Securities Act.


**Risk Factors ..........................** Investing in the Notes involves substantial risks. You should consider carefully all
the information in this offering memorandum and, in particular, you should
evaluate the specific risk factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section before
making a decision whether to invest in the Notes.


-----

**Listing ...................................** Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited
(the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is no
assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that
such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted, or that such listing will be
maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any
time, without the consent of the Holders or the Holders’ Representative, de-list the
Notes from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of the Notes
to another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be a stock
exchange that is not regulated by the European Union). See “Description of the
_Notes—Maintenance of Listing”._

**Governing Law .....................** The Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, the Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements are or will be, as
applicable, governed by German law. The Security Documents are or will be, as

**Tax Considerations ..............**


For a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in
the Notes, see “Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”. You
should consult with your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. Federal, state, local
and other tax consequences of an investment in the Notes.


**Book-Entry and Form .........** The Notes will be represented by a separate global note in bearer form deposited
and immobilized with, and held by, Clearstream Banking. Definitive notes
representing individual Notes will not be issued. Transfer of the Notes will be
subject to the rules of Clearstream Banking and the terms of separate Book-Entry
Registration Agreements among Clearstream Banking and the Issuer with respect
to the Notes.

**SUMMARY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Progroup AG Financial Information**

The financial information contained in the following tables is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements
of the Issuer as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 as well as from the accounting records
and other internal documents of the Issuer. The results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for any future period.

The financial information marked as “audited” in tables in this offering memorandum is taken from the audited consolidated
financial statements, included elsewhere in theoffering memorandum. The financial information marked as “unaudited” in
tables in this offering memorandum is taken from the Company’s accounting records or internal management reporting
and controlling systems or is based on calculations of figures from the abovementioned sources, including the audited
consolidated financial statements.

In the following tables, we also present certain non-GAAP measures and ratios, including Total Output, Gross Profit,
EBITDA, Trade Working Capital, Free Cash Flow, Change in Total Working Capital, Core Operating Cash Generation,
Cash Conversion, Total Liabilities, Total Financial Debt, Net Financial Debt as well as other pro forma data that are not
required by, or presented in accordance with, German GAAP. Our management believes that the presentation of these nonGAAP measures is helpful to investors because these and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors,
security analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. However, you should
not construe these non-GAAP measures as an alternative to net income or other items of our Consolidated Income
Statement determined in accordance with German GAAP, to cash flows from operating activities, investing activities or
financing activities or other items of our Consolidated Cash Flow Statement or to liabilities or other balance sheet items of
our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, these non-GAAP measures and ratios presented by us may not be comparable
to similarly titled measures used by other companies and may have limitations as analytical tool. These non-GAAP
measures have been provided for informational purposes only and are not indicative of historical results, cash flows or
liabilities nor are they meant to be predictive of future results, cash flows or liabilities. Moreover, we have calculated,
reconciled and presented certain of these non-GAAP measures, including in particular, Core Operating Cash Generation,
by mathematically adding and/or subtracting line items from our Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Cash Flow
Statements and Consolidated Balance Sheet, which, in each case, has not been prepared in compliance with the
requirements under Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act or the Prospectus Regulation or the SEC or any other
regulator. Investors are therefore put on notice to treat these non-GAAP measures with caution.

You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the sections “Presentation of Financial Information”,
“Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization”, “Selected Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal_
years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, including the notes thereto.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes to be issued in the Offering involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information_
_contained in this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing the_
_Notes. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our margins and results of operations and financial_
_condition could be materially and adversely affected, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to repay the Notes._
_The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or_
_that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating_
_results or prospects. In any such case, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes when due and you may_
_lose all or part of your investment in the Notes._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors,_
_including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements”._

**RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS**

**_Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity, which is dependent upon_**
**_factors beyond our control._**

Our business may be negatively affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general macroeconomic
conditions, recessionary trends, inflation and volatility in the global capital and credit markets, including in the European
sovereign debt market, the outbreak of severe communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, geopolitical events such as the
Russian invasion in Ukraine and the armed conflict in Israel and Gaza, as well as other general political and economic
developments globally and in the markets in which we operate.

Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity. Increased levels of economic
growth and activity typically result in higher per-capita use of packaging materials, both with respect to transportation of
goods and consumer presentation. This increase in the use of packaging materials (including paper-based packaging
materials), in turn, results in an increase in the demand for our recycled containerboard and corrugated board products.
Because the markets for containerboard and corrugated board products in the developed economies in which we primarily
operate are generally mature, historically there has been a close correlation between general economic growth and demand
for packaging products such as corrugated containers and, therefore, for their component materials such as containerboard
and corrugated board. As a result, our industry is affected by economic conditions in our markets, including changes in
national, regional and local unemployment levels, shifts in consumer spending patterns, credit availability, and business
and consumer confidence. Disruptions in the overall economy and volatility in the financial markets could reduce consumer
confidence, negatively affecting consumer spending, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of
operations. We have been impacted by difficult economic conditions in the past. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example,
resulted in lower demand for our products in the second quarter of 2020, in particular, which led to price reductions in the
third quarter of 2020. At the same time, price for our main raw material, recovered paper, increased partly due to limited
access to recovered paper because of reduced collection levels. Similarly, our sales decreased significantly in 2023,
compared to 2022, mainly as a result of a significant drop in the sales prices for our products due to the weakening market
environment following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These macroeconomic developments had a significant negative
impact on our margins and results of operations in 2020 and 2023, in particular. We are unable to predict the timing or
duration of any downturn in the economy that may occur in the future or the timing or rate at which economic conditions
in our markets may recover in the case of any such downturn.

The Russian war against Ukraine, in particular, has created, or exacerbated, significant challenges for our business and has
therefore had, and continues to have, a material impact on our results of operations. Steep further increases in energy prices,
fears of gas supply shortages and general supply shortages posed major challenges for Europe, with the paper industry, as
an energy-intensive sector, being particularly affected. In addition, sharply rising raw material and transport prices as well
as rising rates of inflation across Europe made significant, incremental price increases for our products unavoidable during
the course of 2022. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the outlook for the global economy remains highly
uncertain, and certain markets, including Europe, may not achieve the growth rates that they have forecasted or historically
observed. Any of the foregoing developments (individually or in aggregate), or a perception that any of these developments
may be likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the economic development of the affected countries or lead
to economic recession or depression that could jeopardize the stability of financial markets or the overall financial and
monetary system. Any of these developments could therefore have a significant negative impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations as well as our ability to perform our obligation under the Notes.

**_The cyclical nature of our industry often results in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of operations._**

We principally generate revenue through the sale of containerboard and corrugated board. Our mills primarily sell the
containerboard we produce to Group-owned corrugated board plants, and we sell our corrugated board to our third-party
customers in the packaging industry. Our operating results are therefore impacted by the packaging industry’s cyclical
pattern, with periods of overcapacity and resulting pressure on pricing of packaging products such as corrugated containers
and, in turn, their component materials such as containerboard and corrugated board. This cyclicality results, in part, from
significant imbalances in supply and demand for containerboard. On the one hand, containerboard production capacity
cannot be readily adapted to reflect changing market conditions, due to the high capital intensity of facilities such as
containerboard mills (which generally continue production as long as paper prices are sufficient to cover their marginal
costs), the long lead time between the planning and completion of new containerboard mills and the fact that new additions
of containerboard capacity tend to be large relative to the overall demand for the product. On the other hand, significant
containerboard and corrugated board price reductions and inventory growth have resulted when capacity has exceeded
demand. In addition, there is the potential to convert graphic and newsprint paper machines into containerboard machines
which has happened recently both in Europe and the United States, and which may contribute to overcapacity.
Consequently, the containerboard and corrugated board industry has from time to time experienced periods of substantial
overcapacity and there can be no assurance that this will not reoccur. Overcapacity in the European market has generally
had a negative impact on prices. See “Industry and Competition—End-Markets Dynamics” and “Industry and
_Competition—Key Market Developments”._

In the absence of sufficient economic growth to generate increased demand or the closure of facilities (either temporarily
or permanently) to mitigate the effect, new capacity can cause a period of regional overcapacity which may lead to
downward pricing and margin pressure. In periods of overcapacity, industry participants may stop operating certain of their
production facilities periodically to reduce inventory levels. In the past, many leading paper manufacturers have reacted to
reduced demand by taking downtime and by rationalizing high-cost and inefficient capacity. Due to the high level of
integration between our three mills and our corrugated board production sites, it is unlikely that we would take downtime
at our mills for any significant length of time, but even if we did so and our competitors continue production at high levels,
our sales volumes could be adversely affected without any significant offsetting benefit of improved prices in the market.
In the event that the industry as a whole does not take sufficient downtime or other measures to reduce capacity during any
periods of overcapacity, this could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial
condition.

Overcapacity in the European containerboard and/or corrugated board markets could be further exacerbated by an increase
of imports from other regions and/or a decrease of exports by European producers to other regions, as a result of a variety
of factors. For example, in the event that producers in other regions (particularly the United States and China) experience
overcapacity within their own local and regional markets, they may seek to increase their level of exports to Europe and
do so at lower pricing levels. This could adversely affect our selling prices and profitability. In addition, the level of exports
of containerboard from or to Europe also depends on relevant freight rates and currency rates. A strong euro, for example,
can have a negative effect on (U.S. dollar-denominated) exports by European containerboard manufacturers with a negative
(for our business) effect on the supply and demand balance and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in
Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also resulted in lower sales by other
European manufacturers who ship products in corrugated packaging, resulting in lower European demand for corrugated
packaging, and therefore lower demand for our containerboard and corrugated board. See also “—We are exposed to
_currency exchange rate fluctuations”._

**_We could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more important customers and the nature of, and close relationships_**
**_with, our small and medium-sized customers exposes us certain risks._**

In 2021, 2022 and 2023, no single customer represented more than 5% of our total sales. However, our level of customer
concentration may increase in the future as a number of industries have experienced consolidation in the past and the
packaging industry in which our customers operate may also be affected by consolidation in the future. In addition, while
no particular customer is significant to our Group as a whole, a number of our customers account for a significant portion
of the sales volumes of one or more of our individual corrugated production sites. Therefore, a loss of one or more of those
customers could have a material adverse effect on the utilization and results of operation of the affected corrugated board
production sites and negative impact our Group’s total sales. For example, one of our largest customers, which accounted
for 3% of our total sales in 2023, commenced production at its own, newly-established corrugated board production facility
at the beginning of 2024. As a result, we expect to lose all of our related corrugated board sales with that customer in the
course of 2024. If other Board customers similarly establish their own corrugated board production facilities, it is likely
that we would also lose most or all of our related corrugated board sales to any such customers. In addition, a large
proportion of our customers are small- or medium-sized, family-owned businesses that are managed by members of the
owner family. A sale of any of those businesses to one of our competitors or to a box manufacturer with its own corrugated
board production, either in connection with a succession event or otherwise, may therefore lead to a loss of the relevant
customer. Furthermore, our own performance and potential future growth generally depends, to a large extent, on the


-----

performance of our customers, which are exposed to many of the same risks as our own business. Our small- and mediumsized customers may also be particularly vulnerable (i) to competition from larger competitors with greater financial
resources and which are able to capitalize on their economies of scale and (ii) to pricing pressure from their own, often
much larger customers.

**_The standardized nature of containerboard could result in downward pressure on pricing and, as a consequence, lower_**
**_earnings._**

Containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer, and this standardization has led to intensified price
competition. This, in turn, creates significant downward pressure on the prices of our products during periods of market
overcapacity or weak demand, which could reduce sales and have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of
operations and financial condition. Our business has in the past faced significant downward pricing pressure, including as
a result of standardization in the markets in which we operate. Given the general upward trend in almost all our input costs
and the high level of volatility in the prices of recovered paper and energy in recent years, we expect we will need to further
increase prices in the mid- to long-term to ensure that earnings from recycled containerboard remain at a long-term
sustainable economic level. We are likely to continue to be exposed to such factors in the future. If we are unable to adjust
our cost base or achieve economies of scale comparable to our competitors, pricing pressure could have a material adverse
effect on our margins and results of operation and financial condition.

**_Operational disruptions at our facilities, in particular our three mills, could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_margins, results of operations and financial condition._**

We currently operate three containerboard mills in Germany, which account for all of our containerboard production. Each
of them is, therefore, critical to our business. If operations at either of our three mills were interrupted for any significant
length of time, either because of natural disasters (such as flooding or fire), man-made disruptions (such as labor strikes or
the incorrect operation of machines), failure to obtain raw materials, technical defects, accidents or for any other reason, it
would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. For example, a technical
defect at our mill in Sandersdorf-Brehna caused multiple shutdowns during 2022 and 2023, resulting in significant loss of
containerboard production and significant financial loss. The replacement of the affected component led to an additional
production stoppage of three to four weeks in 2023, which resulted in a further loss of production and therefore had a
significant negative impact on our results of operation. Furthermore, due to the high level of integration between our three
mills and our corrugated board production sites, any significant interruption of our containerboard production at one or
more of our mills would also have a significant adverse effect on our corrugated board production and our ability to supply
our corrugated board customers, in addition to potentially jeopardizing the reliable supply of our external containboard
customers. Any significant disruptions at one or more of our corrugated board production sites, either because of problems
with our containerboard supply (either from our three mills or from external suppliers) or for any of the other reasons listed
above, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability
to fulfill customer orders from alternative sites in case of a significant disruption at one of more production sites is limited.
In particular, customers we supply from our plants in Italy and the United Kingdom cannot usually be supplied from our
other corrugated board production sites due to their geographical location. Finally, the operation of most of our production
sites also depends on key services and infrastructure provided by third parties. For example, we rely on highly specialized
employees of our equipment suppliers to ensure the proper maintenance and repair of our production equipment. In
addition, the uninterrupted operation of our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt depends, among other things, on the availability
of a waste water treatment plant operated by the local municipal utility and a secure supply of production steam either by
our own waste-to-energy plant and/or by a neighboring power plant which we use as a back-up solution. In the past,
capacity limitations of the local waste water treatment plant in Eisenhüttenstadt due to technical faults have regularly led
to temporary reductions in the containerboard production capacity of our paper machine PM2. Significant future capacity
limitations of the local waste water treatment plant or a shutdown of the local waste water treatment plant would require
us to reduce or shutdown containerboard production at our paper machine PM2, as there are no alternative local water
treatment options. In addition, due to technical faults in the steam pipeline that connects our mill in Eisenhüttenstadt to the
neighboring power plant, there is no guarantee that this back-up solution will be available in the event of maintenance or
other shutdowns of our waste-to-energy plant. Furthermore, our insurance coverage may be inadequate or not cover all
losses. See “—Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the risks we may face and if we were no longer
_covered by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms or at all”. If_
one or more of the aforementioned risks materializes, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_We are exposed to intense competition in the containerboard and corrugated board industry._**

We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. The containerboard and corrugated board industry is
characterized by a high level of price competition as well as other competitive factors, including innovation, design, quality
and service. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our
margins, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Pricing pressure could arise from, among


-----

other things, limited demand growth and existing overcapacity in the market in question, new competitors entering the
market, capacity increases by competitors, including by converting, enhancing or intensifying the use of existing production
facilities or by setting up additional production facilities, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to
capitalize on their economies of scale and create excess product supply, the ability of competitors to operate or successfully
relocate or open production facilities in countries where production costs are lower than those in which we operate and the
access of competitors to new technology which we do not possess.

**_We are exposed to the risk of product substitution._**

The products of our customers in the paper-based packaging industry compete with other forms of packaging, principally
reusable plastic containers. Substitution of plastic containers for corrugated containers may increase in the future and other
substitute products may be introduced. Future packaging developments and trends may drive further substitution.
Substitution is also possible between solidboard packaging and corrugated containers, with the generally lower cost of
corrugated containers offset by the moisture and temperature handling characteristics of solidboard packaging. In addition,
there has generally been increasing scrutiny of single-use packaging, its sustainability and impact on the environment.
While the primary focus of this increasing scrutiny has, so far, been on plastic packaging, there can be no guarantee that
paper-based packaging will not also face increasing scrutiny, which may result in regulatory action and/or changes in
customer preferences in favor of reusable forms of packaging. Any significant substitution away from paper-based
packaging products or from corrugated board to solidboard or other forms of packaging may adversely affect the demand
for our products and therefore our results of operation and profitability.

**_Price fluctuations in raw materials and our ability to pass on price increases could affect our results of operations._**

Our margins and overall profitability are significantly affected by the price of raw materials and the length of time it takes
us to translate price increases in raw materials and other input costs into prices we charge for third-party sales of
containerboard and corrugated board. To the extent our containerboard is sold internally, our profitability will only be
affected by the ability to recover any price increases from third-party sales of corrugated board to our third party customers
in the packaging industry. Furthermore, to the extent that selling prices fall, if we are unable to generate cost savings
through producing products more efficiently or lower our fixed costs, our results may be negatively affected.

In total, raw materials account for the majority of our cost of materials in the years ended 2021, 2022 and 2023. Our primary
raw materials are recovered paper, particularly old corrugated containers and containerboard. The prices for these raw
materials tend to be volatile, and price fluctuations affect our margins. Recovered paper is used in the manufacture of our
containerboard products and is purchased in increasingly competitive, price-sensitive markets. Recovered paper has
historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality and high price volatility over short periods and may do so again in the
future. In particular, the price of recovered paper depends on a variety of factors over which we have no control, including
environmental and conservation regulations, natural disasters and weather. A decrease in the supply of such raw materials
has caused, and any such decrease in the future can be expected to cause, higher cost of materials. In addition, the increase
in demand for products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recovered paper has in the past caused an occasional supply
or demand imbalance in the market for recovered paper. Other important drivers of recovered paper prices are collection
rates of recovered paper as well as freight rates and exchange rates, both of which affect the level of exports of recovered
paper from Europe to other markets. In the past, significant decreases in the prices for recovered paper have led to a
reduction in collection activity, which, in turn, can lead to supply shortages. The effect of these and other factors has created
volatility with respect to the price of recovered paper, and we expect recovered paper prices to continue to fluctuate based
upon supply and demand characteristics. For example, recovered paper prices increased in the second quarter of 2020,
partly due to limited access to recovered paper because of reduced collection levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Recovered paper prices also increased between October 2020 and April 2021 due to new capacity additions in the European
recovered containerboard industry, including our own new paper machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, and
rebust demand from existing containerboard mills. In addition, in part due to digitalization and a change in working patters,
which have recently accelerated in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, high-quality recovered paper grades, such as office
paper, are becoming increasingly scarce in the market. Companies in other parts of the European paper industry, including
the tissue industry, have therefore begun to invest significantly in new technologies, new processes and innovative products
that use lower grades of recovered paper, such as old corrugated containers and containerboard, which may lead to new
and increasing demand and competition, and therefore increased prices, for our key raw material.

Another important driver of recovered paper prices is the balance of supply and demand for paper products in general.
When the price of recovered paper begins to rise, containerboard manufacturers attempt to raise their prices to preserve
profit margins, which generally narrow as a result of increased raw material costs. It typically takes approximately two to
three months for the containerboard mills to pass on their raw material price increases to the corrugated board
manufacturers. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard
cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases
on to their customers. In particular during periods of rising recovered paper prices, our profitability has therefore
historically been adversely affected.


-----

However, our ability to pass the costs of our raw materials and other input costs on to our packaging customers depends
on a number of other factors, including the supply and demand balance for containerboard and corrugated board in a
particular region and the ability of our customers to maintain or increase prices with their own customers. We generate
almost all of our sales through purchase orders from our customers based on our price lists which we adjust in response to
market price movements and only have very few contracts with our customers which provide minimum purchase
obligations and/or pricing clauses that would allow us to automatically pass increased costs on to our customers. As a result
of these factors, there can be no guarantee that the price of recovered paper and the prices for our containerboard and
corrugated board products will always be closely correlated. Any extended mismatch between the price of recovered paper
and the market prices for our products could have a significant effect on our margins and results of operations and financial
condition.

For example, our EBTIDA declined significantly from €223.2 million in 2019 to €178.1 million in 2020. Notwithstanding
a significant increase in the volumes of both our corrugated board and containerboard sales in 2020, our sales decreased
slightly in 2020 due to significantly lower average sales prices for our products in 2020, which was caused by a combination
of reduced demand for our products due to the COVID-19 pandemic and new capacity additions in the European market
for containerboard, including our own new paper machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. At the same time, the
average price for recovered paper increased in 2020, both because of reduced collection levels as a result of the COVID19 pandemic and the new capacity additions, which increased the demand for recovered paper. Similarly, our EBITDA
declined from a record high of €412.0 million in 2022 to €200.8 million in 2023. Our sales decreased significantly in 2023,
compared to 2022, mainly as a result of a significant drop in the sales prices for our products due to the weakening market
environment and general macro-economic outlook following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This drop in the sales prices
for our products was only partially offset by a fall in the price of recovered paper in 2023 compared to 2022, which led to
a compression of our margins.

In addition to recovered paper, which we use extensively in our containerboard production at our three mills, we also
purchase containerboard from external suppliers as a raw material for our corrugated board production. The prices of
containerboard can also be highly volatile. See also “—Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of
_economic growth and activity, which is dependent upon factors beyond our control” and “—The cyclical nature of our_
_industry often results in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of operations” above, as well as “—We are_
_exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations” below._

**_Increased energy costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation._**

Our production processes, in particular our containerboard production at our three mills, are energy intensive. We produce
a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves, with our existing wasteto-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt, and we have commenced construction of a further waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) at the
site of PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, to supply our paper machine PM3 with the majority of the required process heat as
well as a portion of the required electricity. However, our production processes are nevertheless reliant on third parties for
the supply of energy, and energy costs, including costs for electricity, gas and steam, represented our second largest
purchasing cost item in 2023. Market prices for energy, in particular for electricity, oil and natural gas, have historically
been volatile and have had a corresponding effect on our production costs. The ongoing inflationary surge, the central bank
measures seeking to contain inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, partially due to the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine
and the continuing violence in Gaza and surrounding countries, may contribute to further drive market unpredictability in
the future and may increase the degree of volatility in the prices for energy in the near future. For example, as a result of
the Russia invasion in Ukraine, energy prices reached multi-year highs in 2022. There can be no assurances that we will
not face significant increased energy costs for, or disruptions in energy supplies to, our sites in the future. Any interruption
or shortage of energy supply or our inability to pass through rising energy costs could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

We may be subject to potential margin erosion in case we become unable to pass through increases in energy costs in the
future. See also “—Our energy costs, in particular in Germany, are dependent on the regulatory framework for the
_electricity sector, which is subject to constant change and, in addition, we may face material cost increases if we lose_
_certain financial privileges which we benefit from in Germany with regard a number of statutory surcharges, network_
_access fees and other fees” below. We may also become less competitive vis-à-vis our competitors based in regions less_
impacted by the increasing energy prices in Europe and especially in Germany if we continue to increase prices. Our present
and future hedging arrangements may not be sufficient and the cost of any future hedging arrangements may increase our
hedging costs. In addition, hedged energy volumes may turn out to be too expensive due to market price volatility and
therefore have a negative impact on our cost position. Moreover, there can be no assurances that we will not face significant
disruptions in energy supplies to our sites. Our customers may also require us to decrease our prices if and when energy
prices decrease.

Although we expect that the completion of our additional waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) in Sandersdorf-Brehna will lead
to a further, sustained reduction of our energy costs, as described in more detail under “Management’s Discussion and


-----

_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Expansion_
_Projects and Investment Program”, neither our investment into our additional waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) nor the other_
measures we have taken to reduce our exposure to fluctuating energy prices may be adequate and they may even be counterproductive. For example, we are directly responsible for, and are, or will be, bearing all risks related to, the day-to-day
operation of our waste-to-energy plants, which includes responsibility for unexpected repair costs, for any shutdowns of
our waste-to-energy plants as well as the operational risks associated with the disposal of the ash generated by our wasteto-energy plants (i.e., that we are unable to procure the proper disposal of the ash and may therefore be forced to shut down
the waste-to-energy plants). For example, an operating error by our staff in October 2023 led to a blockage in a core
component of our waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt. Due to the high temperatures in the core components of the
plant and the difficult accessibility, the work to clear the blockage took more than three weeks, which resulted in significant
costs and loss of energy production. There can be no guarantee that the operating expenses for our waste-to-energy plants
will not increase in the future. In addition, we bear the full economic risk related to the procurement of refuse-derived fuels
for our waste-to-energy plants. Further, our outside suppliers may default on their obligations under our refuse-derived fuel
supply agreements with them. Any significant increase in market prices, transportation costs, grid fees or taxes (including
by reduction of tax benefits) associated with the supply of energy would also increase our operating costs. Any inability or
delay in passing on increases in energy costs to our customers or any interruption or shortage of energy supply may
negatively impact our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our energy costs, in particular in Germany, are dependent on the regulatory frameworks for the electricity sector and_**
**_the natural gas sector, which are subject to constant change and, in addition, we may face material cost increases if we_**
**_lose certain financial privileges which we benefit from in Germany with regard to a number of statutory surcharges,_**
**_network access fees and other fees._**

In addition to general market dynamics, our energy costs are dependent on the regulatory frameworks for the electricity
sector and the natural gas sector both from the European Union and from national governments. See also “—We are subject
_to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and the cost of compliance or the failure to comply_
_with, and any liabilities under, current and future laws and regulations may negatively affect our business”. In recent years,_
these regulatory frameworks have been subject to substantial change and it is expected to continue to be subject to change
in the future. Such change is not only due to legislative reforms, but is also prompted by administrative and judicial
decisions.

In Germany, where all three of our paper mills are located, our energy costs have been strongly impacted by regulatory
decisions related to the so-called “Energiewende”. This German energy policy focuses on promoting the development of
renewable energy sources and, among other developments, has already resulted in the complete cessation of the production
of nuclear power in Germany. To mitigate the impact of the resulting significant increases in electricity prices for
energy-intensive industries, the German government adopted rules that provide for various businesses, including us, to be
reimbursed for certain energy-related taxes and/or infrastructure investment surcharges necessary for the implementation
of the “Energiewende”. However, such rules have not only been subject to challenges in German courts and EU scrutiny
as potentially illegal subsidies, but also continue to be the subject of political scrutiny by various interest groups. There is
no guarantee that they will not change again or that we will continue to be able to benefit from current accommodations,
reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes. In particular, it cannot be ruled out that the EU may introduce more
stringent conditions for any such accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes in the future
and/or may further restrict the ability of companies to combine benefits of different reduction schemes (so-called
“cumulation”).

The governments of other countries in which we operate production facilities or may operate production facilities in the
future, may adopt similar policies in order to promote the usage of renewable energy sources. As a consequence thereof,
the energy price could increase and there can be no guarantee that we will be reimbursed to the extent to which the price
increased, to the same extent as we currently are reimbursed in Germany or even at all. This could consequently adversely
affect the revenue of our production facility and may force us to adopt capital-intensive countering measures or ultimately
even close the relevant plants. As an “energy-intensive enterprise”, we have historically benefitted from various other
privileges and exemptions from energy-related laws and regulations in Germany, including benefits pursuant to Section 19
of the German Ordinance on Electricity Network Access Fees (Stromnetzentgeltverordnung, “StromNEV”), the German
Electricity Tax Act (Stromsteuergesetz, “StromStG”), the German Building Energy Act (Gebäudeenergiegesetz), the
Germany Energy Tax Act (Energiesteuergesetz, “EnergieStG”) and other laws and regulations. Should we lose any or all
of these privileges and exemptions, this could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and
financial condition. Finally, our three existing mills are subject to the EU Emission Trading Scheme (the “EU ETS”).

The paper industry was granted the status as a so-called “Carbon Leakage” sector and our three mills have therefore been
allocated a certain amount of CO2 emission certificates for free. Historically, the collective CO2 allocations granted to our
three existing mills have exceeded our collective annual CO2 emissions. The free allocation rules for the fourth trading
period (2021-2030), which were adopted in December 2018, still contemplate the allocation of free CO2 emission
certificates for Carbon Leakage industries, and the latest Carbon Leakage list for the years 2021-2030 adopted by the


-----

European Commission effective as of May 2019 still lists the paper industry as threatened by Carbon Leakage for thre
current trading period. As a result, our three mills continue to be allocated at least a portion of the CO2 emission certificates
required for their operation free of charge. However, even with these expected free CO2 allocations, there is considerable
risk that in the future our costs will significantly increase and will not be recovered through higher prices for our end
products. See also “Business—Regulatory Environment—Regulation governing the operation of the Waste-to-Energy
_Plant”._

**_We may fail in successfully implementing our business strategy._**

In order to continue to realize cost savings or process optimizations, we must continue to optimize our costs, improve our
procurement process, realize certain operating efficiencies and improve the efficiency of our sales force. Key focus areas
of our Continuous Improvement Program involve (i) improving the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities,
(ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and (iii) stabilizing our specific fixed costs in order to achieve sales
excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost leaders in the recycled containerboard market. As we are unable to
influence commodity and energy prices directly, our competitiveness and long-term profitability are, to a significant degree,
dependent upon our ability to reduce costs (including the costs of raw materials and consumables such as power, labor and
transport) and maintain low-cost, efficient operations. Our production costs are also significantly affected by production
volumes and, therefore, our ability to maintain production levels and maximize capacity utilization will be a key factor in
determining our overall cost competitiveness. Our ability to maintain earnings and undertake capital expenditure could be
adversely affected in the event of a sustained material fall in prices for our products, an appreciable rise in our production
costs or a decline in our production volumes. A number of factors beyond our control, such as operating disruptions,
personnel turnover, competition, unforeseen delays in implementing initiatives and general economic and industry
conditions as well as future development on the energy markets, could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement
our strategy by limiting our ability to grow or our ability to reduce costs and increase efficiency which could have a material
adverse effect on our business. We may not be successful in achieving cost savings, generating growth and increasing our
cash flows and profitability, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and on our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes.

**_Efforts to improve our operational efficiency in accordance with our business plan may not be effective and may_**
**_adversely impact our sales and marketing operations, product development and production processes._**

We have implemented and are continuing to implement various projects to improve our operational efficiency, including
with respect to our production network and processes as well as sales, marketing, procurement and product development.
Some of these operational improvement initiatives and cost reduction measures represent important aspects of our business
plan, in particular our initiatives in connection with the continuing optimization of our paper machines PM2 and PM3 and
our continuing efforts to further optimize production of our paper machine PM1 and our corrugators. See also
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our
_Results of Operations—Continuous Improvement Program” and “Business—Our Strategy—Maintain cost leadership_
_through continuous efficiency and profitability improvements”._

If our ongoing efforts to improve our operational efficiency fail or the implementation of cost improvement measures are
not effective, sustainable or achievable within the anticipated time frame, the quality and cost of our products and our
competitive position in the industry may suffer. Additionally, because we have factored the expected benefits of these
improvement initiatives and cost reduction measures into our business plan, our inability to successfully execute these
plans or our failure to realize the expected economic benefits of these plans could have a material adverse effect on our
margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**_The costs and difficulties of integrating complementary businesses through organic and acquisitive expansion could_**
**_impede our future growth and adversely affect our competitiveness._**

To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe in the longterm and to allow us to successfully meet the requirements of our customers with regard to supply certainty and product
quality, we intend to continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of
our production facilities as part of our long-term “Two Twentyfive” strategy. In addition to the successful ramp-up at our
corrugated board plant (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom in 2019 and 2020, following commencement of
production in January 2019, and the successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld,
Germany, in late 2019 and 2020, following commencement of projection in November 2019, we commenced production
at our newest paper machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany in August 2020 and at our newest corrugated board
“mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland in January 2023. In the short- to mid-term, we intend to continue to make
significant further investments in expanding our corrugated board production capacity, and we have already commenced
construction of a further corrugated board plant (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany (with test production expected to start in
the first half of 2024). We have further started construction of a new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) at the site of PM3 in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany to supply our paper machine PM3 with the majority of the required process heat as well as


-----

a portion of the required electricity, and we have already commenced construction of another corrugated board “mega
plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy in the fourth quarter of 2023. See also “Business—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen
_our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled investments” below._

Risks that we could face with respect to any of those proposed or potential further expansion project may include:

- greater than expected costs and management time and effort involved in identifying, completing and integrating
expansions, acquisitions, packaging park projects or joint ventures, diverting capital and time from other parts of
our business;

- delays in project realization or slower than planned production ramp-ups;

- necessary authorizations not being available at all, in full or at the required time;

- potential disruption of our ongoing business and difficulties in maintaining our internal control environment,
information systems and procedures;

- inability to successfully integrate the services, products and personnel of any acquisition into our operations or to
realize any expected cost savings or other synergy benefits from any acquisition;

- customer overlap or loss of customers supplied prior to the acquisition by both us and the acquired group;

- incurrence of unexpected, actual or contingent liabilities;

- a need to incur debt, which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses due to increased debt
service obligations; and

- lack of return on our investment, including as a result of increased competition for acquisition targets and higher
purchase prices for such acquisitions.

The impact on us of any such proposed or potential future expansion projects, acquisitions or joint ventures cannot be
predicted and any of the risks outlined above, should they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our margins
and results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations._**

Given the growing geographic spread of our operations, we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
For example, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and Poland do not use the euro as their national currency. During
the year ended December 31, 2023, 18%, 10% and 4% of our total sales derived from sales in Polish zloty, British pound
and Czech koruna, respectively. We expect the percentage of our total sales derived in Polish zloty, in particular, to further
increase as a result of the start of commercial production in January 2023 and ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated
board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland.

As a result, fluctuations in the value of local currencies against the euro have had, and may have in the future, a significant
effect on our operations and on our reported results in euro and the comparability of our performance between financial
periods can be significantly affected by fluctuations in local currencies against the euro. We have implemented foreign
currency risk management in order to monitor our foreign currency risk and to enable us to consider taking action if we
decide to do so, but there is no assurance that any such foreign currency risk management will be effective. As a result,
fluctuations in the value of these local currencies against the euro may have a significant adverse effect on our operations
and on our reported results in euro.

The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar is also important for the European containerboard industry, because
exports from the European market influence the balance of supply and demand and the price development of containerboard
in Europe. Movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rate may also have an effect on trading. A weak U.S. dollar over a
sustained period has historically resulted in lower (U.S. dollar-denominated) exports by European containerboard
manufacturers with a negative (for our business) effect on the supply demand balance and an immediate effect on the
pricing of containerboard in Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also resulted
in lower sales by other European manufacturers who ship products in corrugated packaging, resulting in lower European
demand for corrugated packaging, and therefore lower demand for our containerboard and corrugated board. A weak U.S.
dollar may also result in additional competition in the European market from U.S. manufacturers that have an incentive to
sell more products in Europe, due to increased European demand for the relatively lower-priced U.S. goods over higherpriced European goods.

**_The success of our business relies on certain key personnel, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel, other_**
**_qualified management personnel and skilled workers._**

The success of our business relies to a considerable extent on the efforts, abilities and reputation of our executive board
and our senior management team, especially our chief executive officer, Maximilian Heindl and our chief financial officer
Volker Metz. The loss of either Mr. Heindl or Dr. Metz or other key personnel could significantly disrupt our business and
have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. Further, if we lost any of
our key personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully find a suitable replacement in a timely
manner, or at all.

In addition, the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel and
skilled workers in the long-term. We compete with a large number of other companies when recruiting qualified employees.
There is an increasing shortage of qualified personnel in the markets in which we operate, especially personnel with
technical, IT or engineering skills. If we are unable to continue to attract and/or train qualified employees sufficiently and
to retain those employees, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Failure to maintain good employee relations may affect our operations and the success of our business._**

Future developments in relation to our business or otherwise could adversely affect relations with our employees and their
works councils. Labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages could lead to a substantial interruption to our business operations
or otherwise adversely affect the Group and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

**_We may be adversely affected by increasing costs in maintaining our required level of workforce._**

During 2023, we had an average of 1,719 employees (excluding trainees) and personnel expenses constitute a significant
proportion of our cost base. Accordingly, inflationary pressures, changes in applicable laws and regulations or other factors
resulting in increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial
condition.

**_We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and the cost of compliance or the_**
**_failure to comply with, and any liabilities under, current and future laws and regulations may negatively affect our_**
**_business._**

We are subject to a wide range of international, national, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and
water, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated properties. We
could incur significant costs, including fines, penalties, civil and criminal sanctions, investigation and clean-up costs, thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders
enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, the installation of pollution control equipment or other
mandated actions, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or
otherwise.

These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time. There
can be no assurance that the costs of complying with such laws and regulations, or future environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations, will not increase. Such cost increases could have a negative impact on the results of our margins and
results of operations and financial condition.

There can be no assurance that we will be at all times in compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety
requirements, which may lead to the incurrence of material costs or liabilities in the future or impede our ability to obtain
and maintain all licenses, consents or other permits necessary to operate our business. Similarly, there can be no assurance
that we will not experience an environmental spill or accident or discover or otherwise become liable for environmental
contamination in the future. We may incur significant expenditure in connection with the required remediation of past
environmental conditions at both currently-owned and formerly-owned facilities. For example, the land on which we have
constructed our corrugated board “mega plant” (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom is a legacy industrial site with
known asbestos contamination which required environmental remediation. There can be no assurance that the contractually
agreed remediation measures that were undertaken by the seller of the land have been successful and sufficient and that
those remediation efforts, together with relevant environmental insurance policies, will fully protect us from having to
incur any future expenditures in connection with further required remediation.

There can be no assurance that environmental pressure groups and similar organizations will not mount campaigns against
us which, were they to occur, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.


-----

**_Failure to maintain good health and safety practices may have an adverse effect on our business._**

Our employees carry out relatively difficult and specialized tasks, and a serious incident affecting the health and safety of
any of our employees could disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our reputation. We may also be subject
to fines or litigation if a health and safety incident occurs. Furthermore, disruption of operations caused by a major incident
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our licenses may be suspended, amended or terminated prior to the end of their terms or may not be renewed._**

Our licenses and permits required to conduct our business operations could be revoked, withdrawn or amended by the
relevant authorities under certain circumstances. For example, a license or permit could be revoked, withdrawn or amended
if there is a subsequent change of facts or a relevant regulation, such permit is found to be contrary to the public interest,
or it is deemed necessary to prevent severe harm to the common good.

Moreover, private individuals and the public have the right to comment upon the process, raise objections to proposed
permits and initiate court proceedings to intervene and prevent the granting of requested permits. In addition, environmental
organizations, residents or other third parties may raise objections to our current or proposed activities or file suits
challenging our operations and the granting or existence of permits and licenses to conduct our operations.

The permitting rules are complex and may change over time, making our ability to comply with the applicable requirements
more difficult or even impossible, thereby precluding continuing or future operations. Regulatory authorities exercise
considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance. Requirements imposed by these authorities may be
costly and time-consuming and may result in delays in the continuation of our operations.

If any of our licenses or permits is revoked, withdrawn or amended, or if we have difficulty renewing a license or permit,
we may experience delays in our operations which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_We are exposed to the particular risks related to our increasingly international operations._**

Our operations have become increasingly international. In addition to our home market, Germany, we currently operate
facilities in the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. As a result, we are vulnerable to risks in
these countries and to the particular risks inherent in international operations, including:

- increased difficulties in the collection of accounts receivable, including longer collection periods;

- inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in legislation or regulatory requirements (including with regard to
pandemics) and increased difficulty and expense in hiring and dismissing employees; work stoppages, transport
interruptions and difficulties in managing international operations;

- adverse tax consequences, including as a result of complex transfer pricing regulations;

- adverse currency fluctuations or restrictions on the transfer of cash;

- exposure to local economic and social conditions, including logistical and communication challenges;

- exposure to volatility in the global banking sector; and

- exposure to local political conditions, including political disputes, requirements to expend a portion of funds locally,
increased risk of fraud and political corruption, or similar events.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations due to the related
delays or increased costs in the production and delivery of products and services.

**_We are subject to antitrust and similar legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate._**

We are subject to a variety of antitrust and similar legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In Germany as well
as in some of our other markets, we have a market position that may make potential future acquisitions difficult and may
limit our ability to expand by acquisition or merger, if we wished to do so.

In addition, we are subject to legislation in all the jurisdictions in which we operate relating to unfair competitive practices
and similar behavior, both on an EU level and on a national level. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to
allegations of, or regulatory investigations or proceedings into, such practices or behavior. In the event that such allegations
are made or investigations or proceedings are initiated (irrespective of merit), we may be required to devote significant
management resources to our defense against such allegations. In the event that such allegations are proved, we may be


-----

subject to significant fines, damages awards and other expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our results may be adversely affected if we are unable to implement our strategy to optimize utilization of assets._**

Our results of operations are materially influenced by the degree to which we are able to optimize the utilization of our
assets in order to achieve the necessary production volumes to achieve our business plans. We cannot guarantee that we
will be able to optimize the utilization of assets in accordance with our plans, or at all, due to, among other things,
unforeseen disruptions which are beyond our control. For example, we continuously work to further optimize production
of our paper machines PM1, PM2 and PM3. If we are not able to optimize the usage of our three paper mills and other
production facilities, the expected return on our related investments may not be realized. Any other inability to optimize
and sustain the capacity utilization of our production facilities or achieve cost efficiencies through improvements in
production processes may have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our business operations are capital intensive, and we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to_**
**_maintain our competitive position._**

The operation and expansion of our business require substantial capital expenditures. In addition to our significant recent
investments in and establishments of our newest paper mill (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, primarily between 2019 and
2020, and our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, primarily in 2022 and 2023, we have ongoing
capital expenditure requirements relating to, among other things, the modernization and maintenance of our existing plants.
In particular, we have incurred (and expect to continue to incur) significant capital expenditures in connection with the
launch and ramp-up of our new corrugated board “mega plant” in Strykow, Poland (PW14), and the ongoing establishment
and subsequent launch and ramp-up of our proposed corrugated board site in Petersberg, Germany (PW15) and our
proposed further corrugated board “mega plant” in Cessalto, Italy (PW16) as well as a new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2)
at the site of PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany as described elsewehere in this offering memorandum. In the short- to
mid-term, we intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production
capacity. We currently expect to make total investments of approximately €120 million, €126 million and €190 million,
respectively, for our proposed two additional corrugated board production sites (PW15 and PW16) and for the proposed
additional waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) in Sandersdorf-Brehna. For further details on our proposed expansion projects
and investment program, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Key Factors affecting our Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program”._

Our ability to expand our business and fund our ongoing operations depends on our ability to generate cash and access
financing. In addition, our liquidity and capital requirements may increase if we decide to pursue further expansion projects
or if we make future acquisitions. We may not generate sufficient cash flow or have access to sufficient funding to meet
these requirements.

Further, we may require information technology enhancements in order to continue providing high-quality IT support for
our production processes. Failure to implement such enhancements may result in reduced quality of processes and loss of
orders and customers. If one or more of the aforementioned risks were to materialize, this could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, even successful expansion (or acquisition) projects can have a negative impact on our profitability in the
short-term. For example, our reduced profitability between 2009 and 2010 following the global financial and economic
crisis coincided with the launch of production at our corrugated board production sites in Strykow, Poland (PW07) and
Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW08) and at our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany (PM2), which involved
significant start-up and ramp-up costs. Similarly, our reduced profitability in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19
pandemic, coincided with the ramp-up of our corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany and the launch
of production and subsequent ramp-up at our paper mill in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany (PM3), which involved
significant start-up and ramp-up costs. In each case, the related costs were largely expected and are normal in our industry,
but their timing put further pressure on our profitability. In addition, even in a positive market environment, it typically
takes two to three years from the launch of a new corrugated board production site until the production site is fully utilized.
For example, we launched our corrugated board production site in Eisfeld, Germany (PW13) in November 2019, but the
site only completed its ramp-up phase in 2021 and therefore, did not operate at a three-shift capacity for an entire year until
2021. Our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland commenced commercial production in
January 2023 and we do not expect it to complete its ramp-up phase and to operate at a full, three-shift capacity until
sometime in 2025. We expect our proposed new corrugated board production site (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany and our
proposed further corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy to also undergo ramp-up phases of different
durations with a corresponding impact on our result of operations. Moreover, the start-up and ramp-up costs and short- to
mid-term impact on our profitability of our latest paper machine project (PM3) will be proportionately higher, due to the
much larger size, higher level of complexity and longer implementation timeframe of such a project, compared to the
establishment of a new corrugated board production site. Even though our newest paper mill in Sandersdorf-Brehna (PM3)


-----

commenced operations in August 2020, it has still not completed its initial ramp-up phase, and we are still continuing our
efforts to optimize our operations at this newest mill, which involves not only the optimization of the performance of PM3,
but also the optimization of connected processes, including the operation of the closed cycle water treatment system at
PM3 and the proposed further waste-to-energy plant that is currently under construction in Sandersdorf-Brehna. Any
significant delays or unforeseen costs in connection with the start-up, ramp-up and/or our optimization efforts in relation
to our recent, ongoing or potential future expansion projects or failure to achieve the envisoned level of performance of the
relevant asset could have a negative impact on our profitability.

**_The availability of, or any significant increase in, the cost of transportation represents a significant risk for our business._**

Transportation plays an important part in our supply chain as we transport a majority of our products, mainly by truck and
to a lesser extent by rail or ship, to our customers. Deliveries are generally made as full truck loads. In addition, most of
the raw materials that we use need to be transported to our production facilities and we also transport large rolls of
containerboard from our three paper mills in Burg, Eisenhüttenstadt and Sandersdorf-Brehna (all located in Germany) to
our twelve corrugated board plants in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. We
meet our freight and logistics requirements mainly through the use of external logistics companies and, to a much lesser
extent, our own fleet of currently 59 trucks through which we carry out approximately 11.3% of our total transportation
requirements. Due to the relatively large size and weight of our products compared to value, freight and logistics expenses
play an important role in our business, and fluctuations in freight prices can have a significant impact on our profitability.
In 2023, our freight expenses, which include freight for deliveries from our plants or other stocks to customers as well as
containerboard shipments from our three mills to our various corrugated board plants, amounted to a total of €113.5 million,
or 8.6%, of our sales.

Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we experienced limited availability of pallets and freight capacity in 2022.
Furthermore, in particular due to higher fuel prices, a shortage of drivers and increased demand, freight expenses increased
significantly from €86.6 million in 2021 to €108.5 million in 2022. Any further material disruption in or lack of availability
of transportation or any additional significant increases in fuel or energy prices, road tolls or demand driven market prices,
including as a result of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, resulting in higher transportation costs, may have a material
adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. In addition, increased costs relating to
vehicle emissions control requirements that have been or may be imposed in the future, particularly due to climate change
related legislation, may also lead to such effects on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**_Disruptions to the operations of computer or data processing systems, including as a result of cyber attacks, may have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects._**

The operation of our plants and our sales and service activities depend on the uninterrupted operation of complex and
sophisticated computer, telecommunication and data processing systems. Between each step along our internal value chain
and our production processes, we must coordinate and monitor complex logistical processes to ensure the efficient flow of
materials and products. In addition, in 2023, approximately 80% of purchase orders for corrugated board from our Board
customers were received electronically, and all material core processes, which must be coordinated to ensure the smooth
and efficient operation of our production processes, are controlled by our proprietary core ERP system, WEPAFORM.
WEPAFORM implements our internal know-how in the form of best practices and rules of conduct. The functionality of
WEPAFORM covers all our core processes, including order processing, raw material planning, production planning,
production control as well as warehousing, shipment and invoicing. See also “Business—Information Technology and
_Process Management”._

Computer and data processing systems and related information technology infrastructure (data center, hardware and wide
and local area networks) are generally exposed to the risk of disturbances, damage, electricity failures, computer viruses,
fire, other disasters, cyber attacks, unauthorized or improper access or abuse by employees and similar events. We recently
implemented a new IT control system. This lengthy process and the associated IT system changeover also had an impact
on the smooth running of the IT control environment. The implementation of the new system may initially lead to
susceptibility to errors that increase the aforementioned risks. In addition, we rely on a small number of key employees
within our IT department who are familiar with WEPAFORM and have been involved in its development. Disruptions to
operations or interruptions in operations involving key software applications (in particular, WEPAFORM) and/or our IT
hardware have occurred, in individual cases, in the past and may occur in the future. Although administration and
production networks are separated, such disruptions or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
maintain our core processes, could lead to production downtime and result in significant lost sales. Some of the software
products we use are hosted by a third party off site, in which case we depend on the hosting company’s infrastructure, and
any interruption, disruption or security breaches at the hosting company’s data center may have an adverse effect on our
operations. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**_A breach of laws and regulations or our contractual commitments related to data protection, data privacy, in particular_**
**_the GDPR, and cybersecurity, may result in significant fines and penalties and other enforcement and could adversely_**
**_affect our business and our financial condition._**

In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit and store data in our technology systems. This data includes
confidential information belonging to us, our customers and other business partners, as well as personally identifiable
information and personal data of individuals, including our employees. Particularly within the European Union, the EEA
and the United Kingdom, data protection legislation is comprehensive and complex and there has been a recent trend toward
more stringent enforcement of requirements regarding protection of personal data. The data protection legislation (i.e., in
the European Union and EEA the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), “GDPR” and in the United Kingdom
the UK Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK General Data Protection Regulation, (“UK GDPR”)) obligates inter alia
European Union, EEA and UK-based companies to comply with a large number of obligations, including: providing
detailed disclosures about how personal data is collected and processed (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible
form); granting comprehensive rights for data subjects in regard to their personal data (including, for example, the right to
access data, the right to be “forgotten” and the right to data portability); requirements to have data processing agreements
in place to govern the processing of personal data on behalf of other organizations; introducing the obligation to notify data
protection regulators or supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, affected individuals) of significant data breaches;
maintaining a record of data processing; and complying with the principal of accountability and the obligation to
demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, trainings and audits. We work to continue to be fully compliant with
our obligations under the GDPR and the UK GDPR and have appointed an external data protection officer who, among
other things, advises on our compliance obligations and assists us in ensuring that our software systems safely process
personal data, which mainly relates to our employees. However, non-compliance with the GDPR and the UK GDPR may
result in significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or £17.5 million respectively, or 4% of
total annual worldwide turnover (whichever is higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. In addition to the
foregoing, a breach of the GDPR or UK GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to
cease/change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). We may
also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered
harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of
internal resources and reputational harm.

In addition, to the GDPR and the UK GDPR, we are also subject to other laws and regulations on privacy, information
security and data protection, including the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz “BDSG”).

Non-compliance with any of these laws and regulations could occur through a result of human error, external hacking,
malware infection, malicious or accidental user activity, internal security breaches, physical security breaches due to
unauthorized personnel gaining physical access or technical defects resulting in a leak or the misuse of such data. It could
result in damage to our reputation, increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches of failures and otherwise
harm our business. In addition, we do not have specific data security insurance coverage and we cannot guarantee that our
general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data
security systems. Should one or more of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operation.

**_Our own climate goals could adversely impact our business and our operating results._**

In addition to increasingly demanding environmental regulations, we have also defined our own goals as part of a
sustainability strategy. To progressively address the challenges of climate change, we have set ourselves certain ambitious
climate targets. For example, we aim to reduce our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions per ton of output by at least
40% by 2030 to make a measurable contribution to limiting global warming. To support this goal, we propose to implement
various measures that will involve additional expenses and investments. For more detail, see “Business—Sustainability
_Focus; Research and Development”. However, these measures and related investments could – at least temporarily – have_
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there can be no assurance that
the investments we have already made and will make in the future will generate positive returns.

**_Our business could be adversely impacted by climate risks and scarce resources._**

The climate risks relevant to our business can be divided into water risks and energy risks. Extreme weather phenomena,
such as periods of heavy rainfall or extreme heat and water scarcity, may also weaken the availability of the water and
energy needed by our production sites. Similarly, such extreme weather phaenomena may cause floodings, which could
result in disruptions to production. The paper business, in particular, is very water-intensive, so it is likely that the paper
industry would be affected by water supply restrictions in the event of any future water shortages. Furthermore, we may
experience a decline in the stability of power supply and a risk of grid failures due to political measures to restructure
energy systems. If we experience any of these climate related risks, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially adversely effected.


-----

**_We rely on outside suppliers and subcontractors and are therefore susceptible to disruptions in our supply chain._**

We rely on outside suppliers and subcontractors and their ability to deliver raw materials, products or services at the right
time and of the right quality. Our most important production inputs are recovered paper, containerboard, freight, energy,
starch and chemicals as well as machinery and equipment. For some of these inputs, we may not be able to rely on an
uninterrupted supply from our regular suppliers. Furthermore, we may encounter a shortage or discontinuation of certain
types of materials purchased from one or more of our suppliers. In the event of a significant interruption or limitations in
the supply of these production inputs from our current suppliers, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find
alternate suppliers or do so without adversely impacting our manufacturing operations, such as an interruption or
downscaling of production or change in the product mix, or increased costs. In addition, we rely on certain specialist service
and technology providers for the continued operation of our facilities and there can be no assurance that we can find
alternative suppliers at the right cost or without interruption to our operations. If one or more of these risks were to
materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We are exposed to general counterparty risk._**

We have contracts with a variety of third parties including customers, suppliers and hedging counterparties. We do not
have control over the management or business of these third parties except indirectly through terms we negotiate in our
contracts with these third parties and we are exposed to risks associated with the financial condition of these third parties.
For example, one of our conveyor technology suppliers filed for insolvency, which meant that our existing plants were at
risk of no longer being supplied with the necessary service and spare parts. If any of these third parties experiences financial
difficulties or changes or terminates its contractual commitments to us, we may incur costs enforcing our contractual rights
and we may incur significant losses from our exposure to third parties. This could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to risks from legal proceedings._**

We are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business and could become involved in additional legal and
arbitration disputes in the future, including but not limited to contractual disputes, debt collection proceedings, intellectual
property disputes and employee disputes. Legal proceedings may involve substantial claims for damages or other payments.
The outcome of pending or potential future proceedings is difficult to predict with any certainty. In the event of a negative
outcome of any material legal or arbitration proceeding, whether based on a judgment or a settlement agreement, we could
be obligated to make substantial payments. In addition, the costs related to litigation and arbitration proceedings may be
significant. The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the risks we may face and if we were no longer covered by our_**
**_existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms or at all._**

Although we maintain insurance policies, including fire, explosion, radiation, electrical damage, machinery breakdown,
fuel or power shortages, third party liability insurance, transport insurance, computer insurance and directors’ and officers’
insurance, not all risks are insured or insurable (and may have significant deductibles on policies). Accordingly, our
insurance policies do not provide coverage for all losses related to our business, and the occurrence of losses, liabilities or
damage not covered by such insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. For example, the damage caused by the shutdown of the waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt was
not covered by our business interruption insurance as the retention was not exceeded. Due to variable insurance market
conditions, there can be no assurance that the insurance that we carry will continue to be available, will be available at
economically acceptable premiums or will be adequate to cover any resulting liability, and we may be required to enforce
insurance coverage or pay high deductibles. In some cases, coverage is not available or is considered too expensive relative
to the perceived risk. If we experience a loss in the future, the proceeds of the applicable insurance policies, if any, may
not be adequate to cover replacement costs, lost sales, increased expenses and/or liabilities to third parties. This could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law._**

Our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient to prevent or detect inadequate practices, fraud and
violations of law by our intermediaries and employees. Due to our business operations in multiple countries in Europe, we
are subject to a number of laws and regulations in various countries. These include, among others, regulations concerning
competition and antitrust law, international trade and customs, licensing and permits, commercial intellectual property and
its enforcement, warranty and product liability, environmental, building and zoning law, energy law, hazardous substances
and chemicals law, labor and work protection law, tax law and regulations related to purchasing and acquisitions.


-----

In the event that any intermediaries, consultants, sales agents or employees with whom we cooperate either receive or grant
inappropriate benefits or generally use corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair business practices, we could be confronted with
legal sanctions, penalties and loss of orders and harm to our reputation. Especially given our increasingly international
profile, the size and the extent of our cooperation with intermediaries, consultants, sales agents and employees, our internal
controls and procedures, policies and our risk management may not be adequate to identify or prevent such practices, which
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may have to repay investment grants and subsidies, or previously awarded investment grants may not be disbursed_**
**_in part or at all._**

A part of our investment requirements for developing and expanding our production capacity is covered by public aid, such
as investment grants, subsidies, loans at favorable conditions or tax reductions or exemptions, both in Germany and abroad.
The decisions on granting public aid received by us contain various conditions such as regarding the use of funds for certain
energy efficiency measures, the creation of jobs, the total investment amount or the duration of our investment. If these
conditions are not fulfilled during the commitment period, which generally exceeds the specified investment period, this
could result in a repayment claim by the relevant authorities for the public aid received by us. During the commitment
period, such conditions may no longer be satisfied and we could be subsequently exposed to considerable repayment and
interest claims. This could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Pending and future tax audits within our Group and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional tax liabilities._**

We are subject to routine tax audits by local tax authorities. Tax audits in Germany for the Group for corporate income tax
(Körperschaftsteuer), trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and VAT (Umsatzsteuer) relating to the years 2018 and 2020 have
provisionally concluded. Provisions in the amount of €1.6 million have been recognized in the audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for the expected additional tax payments from
the tax audit. The expected additional tax payments have not yet been fully assessed by the tax office. As a result, there is
a risk that higher additional tax payments will be assessed than expected. In addition, the tax audit for Progroup Board
S.r.l. for 2019 has been provisionally completed. We have lodged an appeal against the tax office’s findings. The
proceedings have not yet been finalized. There can be no guarantee that these tax audits will not result in any materially
higher tax assessments.

Tax audits for later periods not yet subject to a tax audit or tax audits in other countries may lead to higher tax assessments
in the future. For example, we operate a number of tax groups (Organschaften) in Germany and we are therefore exposed
to the risk of a challenge of the existence and due operation of tax groups in the course of future tax audits. A nonrecognition of our tax groups could lead to additional tax liabilities. The same could apply if we do not comply with our
tax reporting obligations.

Any additional tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation of tax laws by the courts or the tax authorities may
also have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_The international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure may expose us to potentially_**
**_adverse tax consequences._**

Due to the pan-European nature of our business, we are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of,
multiple jurisdictions. We are also subject to intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds
among our companies pursuant to, for example, purchase agreements or other arrangements. Adverse developments in
these laws or regulations, or any change in position by the relevant authority regarding the application, administration or
interpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, including changes in global minimum taxation
rules such as Pillar II, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to
take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, including the tax treatment or
characterization of our indebtedness, including the Notes, payments or other distributions to our shareholders, existing and
future intercompany loans and guarantees or the deduction of interest expenses. We could also fail, whether inadvertently
or through reasons beyond our control, to comply with tax laws and regulations relating to the tax treatment of various of
our financing arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax treatment for such arrangements. If any applicable tax
authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our intercompany loans or
transactions, it could result in the disallowance of deductions, a limitation on our ability to deduct interest expenses, the
imposition of withholding taxes, the application of significant penalties and accrued interest on intercompany loans or
internal deemed transfers, the application of significant penalties and accrued interest or other consequences that could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


-----

If the tax laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are amended, if new adverse laws, rules or regulations are adopted,
or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests, the results could increase our tax payments (prospectively or
retrospectively) and/or subject us to penalties. For example, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives adopted by the EU Council
on July 12, 2016 under Council Directive (EU) 2016/1164 (ATAD I) and as amended by Council Directive (EU) 2017/952
(ATAD II) may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Furthermore, on July 10, 2021 the G20 endorsed the
“OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” (“IF”) to address the tax challenges arising from
the digitalization of the economy. In this context, a law to ensure global minimum taxation and other accompanying
measures was passed by the German Bundesrat on December 15, 2023. The regulations apply for the first time for financial
years beginning after December 30, 2023. As such, there is broad political consensus for a substantial revision to global
tax policy. As a result, these changes could decrease the capital we have available to operate our businesses and have an
overall adverse effect on our businesses and financial performance.

**_Due to restrictions of the deduction of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry forwards under German tax laws,_**
**_we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities._**

Interest payments on the Notes, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and on our other debt may not be fully deductible
for tax purposes, which could adversely affect our financial results. Subject to certain prerequisites, the German interest
barrier rules (Zinsschranke) impose certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest for tax purposes. Since 2008, the
German interest barrier rules in general have disallowed the deduction of net interest expenses exceeding 30% of tax
adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all businesses belonging to the same tax group (Organschaft)
for corporate income and trade tax purposes, i.e., the Issuer and certain Guarantors, are treated as one single business. Such
consolidation is, inter alia, relevant for the calculation of the tax adjusted EBITDA.

There are certain exemptions from the restrictions of the German interest barrier rules allowing for a tax deduction of the
entire annual interest expenses, which, however, may not be available to the Issuer. To the extent our net interest expenses
exceed 30% of our tax adjusted EBITDA in any given year, we may therefore not be able to deduct the excess in our net
interest expense in calculating our taxable earnings for the relevant year. This may have an adverse effect on our liquidity
and financial condition and on our ability to meet our obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees.

Any non-deductible amount of interest expenses exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and may, subject to the
interest barrier rules, be deductible in future fiscal years. In the past, our interest expenses were not entirely deductible.
Accordingly, we used to have an interest carry forward (Zinsvortrag) from previous years. In the meantime all interest
carry forwards have been used until December 31, 2018. Any future interest carry forwards could be forfeited in part or in
full in connection with certain measures, such as a change of our ownership structure.

**_Economic events affecting the European economies may adversely affect our financial position and operating results._**

In previous years, economic events affecting the European economies have raised a number of questions regarding the
overall stability of the European Monetary Union. Despite measures taken by countries in the European Monetary Union
and the European Central Bank to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist with respect to the ability of certain European
Monetary Union countries to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the
euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual European Monetary Union
member states. If the European Monetary Union debt crisis was to be repeated, it is possible that one or more countries
may default on their debt obligations or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency. If such an event
were to occur, it is possible that there would be significant, extended and generalized market dislocation, which may
negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the departure of one or more
countries from the European Monetary Union may lead to the imposition of, among other things, exchange rate control
laws. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect our
trading environment or the value of the Notes and could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our outstanding
debt obligations that are euro-denominated and, because we have a substantial amount of debt denominated in euro, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may be inconsistent with our interests and/or the interests of holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

Jürgen Heindl, the vice-chairman of our Supervisory Board and our founding shareholder, controls JH-Holding, our
controlling shareholder. The interests of our controlling shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with our
interests or with your interests as holders of the Notes. Mr. Heindl has, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things,
to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, the payment of dividends, asset sales and other
significant corporate transactions as well as the ability to elect and change our management and to approve any other
changes to our operations. The interests of our controlling shareholder could conflict with your interests as holders of the
Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due, including under the Notes.
Mr. Heindl and our controlling shareholder could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures,


-----

financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investments although
such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes. Also, Mr. Heindl and the members of his family may
have strategic objectives or business interests that could conflict with our own strategies or interests. If the interests of our
shareholders conflict with our interests or the interests of the holders of the Notes, or if our shareholders engage in activities
or pursue strategic objectives that conflict with our interests or the interest of the holders of the Notes, we and holders of
the Notes could be disadvantaged.

**_The information available to market analysts varies in its degree of comparability._**

This offering memorandum contains information regarding market positions, market shares, growth rates and other industry
data pertaining to our business drawn from reports and other materials compiled by independent professional organizations
and analysts. This includes reports prepared by RISI and research by Vision Hunters. The analysts compiling these reports
base their estimates and conclusions on a variety of sources, some of which may be more comparable than others. These
sources may include:

- official information published by government agencies;

- reports published by exchange listed companies with public reporting obligations;

- information offered voluntarily by privately held companies; and

- the analysts’ own estimates based on information obtained in conversations with competitors, suppliers, customers
and other market participants.

Although our industry uses these reports as a standard source of market data, we cannot determine the level of reliability
and comparability of the data in the reports. The analysts’ estimates and conclusions can vary, and have in the past varied,
materially from the true figures and as a result their reports can under- or over-state market size, market share, growth rates
and other important industry data. Accordingly, you should use caution in using these estimates and any information
regarding market position or shares contained in this offering memorandum and you should not place undue reliance on
such estimates or information.

**_The employees of our waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt are represented by a works council and wage_**
**_discussions between us and representatives of those employees may result in increased personnel expenses in the future._**

Other than our other employees in Germany, the employees of our waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt are represented
by a works council (Betriebsrat). Furthermore, in accordance with the French Works Constitution Act, a works council
represents our employees at our corrugated board production site in Douvrin, France. Therefore, future wage negotiations
may result in higher personnel expenses for the operation of the waste-to-energy plant compared to the historical personnel
expenses for the relevant employees. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business—The
_success of our business relies on certain key personnel, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel, other qualified_
_management personnel and skilled workers”._

**_Our ability to supply electricity to the public power grid will be dependent upon transmission and distribution systems_**
**_and our reliance on third parties._**

The sale and supply of electricity produced by our waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt and the proposed further
waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) in Sandersdorf-Brehna to the public grid is dependent upon the infrastructure of the local
power grid systems. We have no control over the operation of these power grid systems and we must rely on independent
third-party power grid system operators. Different companies operate the transmission grids and the distribution grids in
Germany. The transmission grid in the region around Eisenhüttenstadt is operated by E.DIS AG and there are a number of
different operators of distribution grids.

Any failure of such power grid systems or reduction of available capacity, including as a result of grid congestion, natural
disasters, insufficient maintenance or inadequate development, could prevent us from selling and supplying electricity from
our waste-to-energy plants. In Germany, grid congestion has recently caused operational issues for certain power generation
plants, as the increase of co-generation and renewable energy in Germany that has a priority feed-in right to German power
distribution networks has led to a reduction of available grid capacity for conventional power plants. In addition, as these
power grid systems are operated by independent third parties who will not be our contractual partners, we will not carry
insurance in this regard which would compensate us in the event of an operational failure. Additionally, under the German
Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, “EnWG”), network operators are responsible for the security and
reliability of the power supply system and required to balance differences between generation and consumption. Therefore,
if the safety or reliability of the transmission system is endangered, particularly in the case of grid bottlenecks, network
operators are required to take remedial grid-related or market-related action, including changes to current electricity feed-in,


-----

transit and output. In doing so, under the EnWG and the German Renewable Energies Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz),
network operators may choose to disconnect power plants from the grid temporarily to reduce or prevent congestion. In
any such case, conventional power plants would be the first to be disconnected, followed by co-generation plants and
renewable power plants. We would not be entitled to compensation by the network operator for the losses incurred as a
consequence of such measures. Due to the nuclear power phase-out and as renewable power generation and cogeneration
increases rapidly in Germany and the capacity of affected transmission and distribution grids is often not expanded
sufficiently to accommodate this increase, there is an increasing risk of grid congestion and subsequent regulation of feed-in
power capacity of conventional power plants during certain hours.

Any failure of the power grids or a disconnection of our waste-to-energy plants from the power grid, e.g., due to congestion
and respective measures by the network operator, could negatively impact our electricity sales, and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_As an owner and operator of a waste-to-energy plant, we are directly subject to a wide range of laws and regulations_**
**_specifically governing the German energy sector and the disposal of waste, which are subject to constant change._**

As an owner and operator of a waste-to-energy plant, we are directly subject to a wide range of laws and regulations
specifically governing the German energy sector and the disposal of waste. See “Business—Regulatory Environment—
_Regulation governing the Operation of the Waste-to-Energy Plant”._

The operating costs and results of operations of Progroup Power 1 GmbH and our existing waste-to-energy plant in
Eisenhüttenstadt as well as the operation of our proposed further waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) in Sandersdorf-Brehna will
be significantly impacted by the relevant regulatory framework for the electricity sector both on the European and the
national level. In the past years, this regulatory framework has been subject to substantial change and it will continue to be
subject to change in the future. Such change is not only due to legislative reforms, but is also prompted by administrative
and judicial decisions. See also “—Our energy costs, in particular in Germany, are dependent on the regulatory framework
_for the electricity sector, which is subject to constant change and, in addition, we may face material cost increases if we_
_lose certain financial privileges which we benefit from in Germany with regard to a number of statutory surcharges,_
_network access fees and other fees”._

Any such changes, in particular any loss or significant reduction of certain financial privileges we currently enjoy under
the German Energy Financing Act (Energiefinanzierungsgesetz) or the StromNEV, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As another example, the fluidized bed boiler
(Wirbelschichtkessel) of our waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt for the thermal utilization of refuse-derived fuels is
currently excluded from the EU ETS as it benefits from an exemption under the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading
Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz, “TEHG”). In 2026, the European Commission will assess the feasibility of
including waste incineration in the EU ETS with effect from 2028. A partial or outright loss of this exemption, as a result
of legal changes in the future, would result in significant additional administrative expenses as well as costs for purchasing
CO2 emission certificates. However, regardless of any potential future inclusion of waste incineration under the EU ETS,
waste-to-energy plants are already burdened with (increasing) CO2 costs. Starting from 2024, fuels that are used in waste
incineration plants requiring an immission control permit pursuant to Number 8.1.1 (or 8.1.2 with waste oil as th[e ]main
fuel) Annex 1 of the 4[th] Federal Immission Control Ordinance (Vierte Verordnung zum BImSchG — 4. BImSchV) are
subject to reporting requirements and the obligation to surrender emission allowances under the Fuel Emissions Trading
Act (Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz, “BEHG”) for CO2 emissions stemming from the fossil part of the fuels (see also
“Carbon _Emission_ _Compliance”)._ In response to a judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court
(Bundesverfassungsgericht) dated November 15, 2023 concerning Germany’s Federal Budget, the German legislator has
recently increased the CO2-prices for emission allowances under the BEHG by €10, i.e., from €35 to €45 for 2024 and
from €45 to €55 for 2025.

Any further tightening of general emission limits under relevant EU or German laws and regulations may require us to
incur significant capital expenditure and ensure continued compliance by our waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt
with all relevant laws and regulations. Since our waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt primarily uses, and our proposed
further waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) in Sandersdorf-Brehna will primarily use, refuse-derived fuels (including processed
household and commercial waste), the operation of the waste-to-energy plants is particularly tightly regulated and is subject
to a high level of regulatory scrutiny. Any breach of emissions limits under applicable laws and regulations, for example,
due to equipment malfunction or a failure of the procedures for screening the waste before it is being incinerated, may
force us to temporarily shut down our waste-to-energy plants or cause the relevant regulators to impose administrative
sanctions and/or modify the operating permits for our waste-to-energy plants, which could result in significant costs.

In addition, the reduction or elimination of certain energy-related tax credits, reductions and exemptions or other changes
in tax laws, in particular under the StromStG and the Energie StG, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, we may be adversely affected by any regulatory changes
that may favor recycling over the thermal utilization of the refuse-derived fuels used in the operation of waste-to-energy


-----

plants. For example, certain counties (Landkreise) in which one of our suppliers of refuse-derived fuels operates have
recently adopted a new scheme for the collection of certain recyclables and organic waste. As a result of this change, other
regulatory changes or similar developments in other regions, the amount and quality of household waste our supplier will
be able to collect will likely decrease which will make it more difficult for our supplier to supply us with the agreed amount
of refuse-derived fuels under the supply agreement, it may become more difficult to obtain the required quality and/or
quantities of refuse-derived fuels to ensure the operation of our waste-to-energy plants in the future and/or the waste
disposal fees we are able to charge for the thermal utilization of the refuse-derived fuels may decrease, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, we are subject to various compliance, reporting and audit requirements under applicable laws and regulations,
which require us to incur additional costs, including for the services of external advisers. Under the German Energy
Services Act (Gesetz über Energiedienstleistungen und andere Energieeffizienzmaßnahmen, “EDLG”), for example,
certain larger companies are required to carry out an energy audit, unless they have implemented an energy management
system (“EnMS”). Since our waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt has implemented an EnMS, it is currently exempt
from the energy audit requirement. However, the requirements of the EDLG also apply to current members of the Group
and the Issuer as well as certain of its subsidiaries will still be required to carry out an energy audit under the EDLG. In
addition, according to Section 8 paragraph 1 of the recently established Act to Increase Energy Efficiency in Germany
(Energieeffizienzgesetz) of November 13, 2023, all companies with a total final energy consumption of more than 7.5 GWh
are required to set up an energy or environmental management system by July 18, 2025. Failure to comply with these and
other requirements and any relevant laws or regulations could also expose us to fines. See also “Business—Regulatory
_Environment—Regulation governing the Operation of the Waste-to-Energy Plant”._

**_We may be adversely affected by increasingly strict regulations aimed at reducing the environmental impact of_**
**_packaging._**

The regulatory framework in the countries in which we operate often evolve and we may become subject to additional or
different regulations and standards. Growing concerns regarding the environmental impact of packaging have led and may
continue to lead to the implementation of strict laws and regulations aiming, among other things, at increasing the collection
and recycling of packaging, reducing packaging waste and litter and introducing specific packaging design requirements.
For example, in November 2022, the European Commission released a proposed revision of the Packaging and Packaging
Waste Directive (Directive 94/62/EC) with the aim to set strict requirements for packaging products and achieve higher
reuse and recycling rates by 2030. The European Commission’s proposal envisages key measures such as restrictions on
over-packaging, mandatory product reuse targets and common design criteria aimed at increasing recycling rates across
ranges of packaging products. Environmental regulations such as these as well as future events, such as changes in laws
and technology, the promulgation of new laws or the development or the discovery of new facts or conditions could expose
us to the risks of incurring substantial costs and liabilities. If the costs of complying with these laws and regulations continue
to increase and we are not successful in passing such additional costs, in whole or in part, onto our customers, any such
changes could have a negative impact on our profitability. Any of the foregoing, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be negatively impacted by public opposition to the operation of our existing facilities and/or to our ongoing or_**
**_potential future expansion projects._**

The establishment and operation of our facilities involves large-scale construction and ongoing emissions (such as noise
and smell) which can negatively impact neighbouring communities. As a result, there can be no guarantee that we will
always be able to anticipate and address or avoid potential public opposition either to potential future expansion projects
or the ongoing operation of our existing facilities. Even the ongoing operation of long-established facilities may provoke
public debate, protests or opposition as a result of demographic changes, changes in public perception of our industry or
otherwise. This, in turn, may force us to modify our existing operations, require us to engage with relevant public
authorities, expose us to legal proceedings, cause delays in the completion of any ongoing projects or even force us to
abandon proposed future projects altogether, all of which could have a negative impact on our reputation, business,
financial condition or results of operations.

**_RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL POSITION_**

**_We are subject to significant restrictive debt covenants under the Conditions of Issue and our Senior Secured Facilities_**
**_Agreements, all of which limit our operating flexibility._**

The Conditions of Issue and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements contain, or will contain, covenants significantly
restricting our ability to, among other things:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;


-----

- create or incur liens;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain restricted payments and certain investments or sell or transfer certain assets;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to, and
on the disposal, transfer or lease of assets by subsidiaries;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;

- consolidate or merge with other entities; and

- impair the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue
expansions, acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest. The Conditions of Issue and the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreements will permit us to incur unsecured as well as secured debt in the future, which may be
substantial.

In addition, our Senior Secured Facilities Agreements include covenants that, in general, impose similar, if not tighter,
restrictions on the actions mentioned above. In addition, the covenants under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreements
impose further restrictions on the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

- purchase Notes in the secondary market;

- transfer our center of main interest to a jurisdiction outside of Germany; and

- amend constitutional documents.

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also includes a springing minimum EBITDA covenant, which
requires us to maintain a certain minimum EBITDA, which will step up over time (i) at any quarterly testing date during a
time during which the aggregate base currency amount of all utilizations and cash ancillary outstanding under the Senior
Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be greater than 40 per cent of the total commitments thereunder (a
“Trigger Period”) or (ii) if a utilization has been requested at any time where a Trigger Period is continuing or would be
caused by the proposed utilization. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement”. Our ability to meet these financial tests may be affected by events beyond our control and, as
a result, we may not be able to meet these tests. Any breach of the minimum EBITDA covenant under the Senior Secured
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could result in a draw-stop under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and/or
an acceleration of that facility, which in turn could, subject to certain threshold amounts being reached, trigger a cross
acceleration of the Notes or the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements.

As a result of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in the instruments discussed above or under any other
outstanding debt instruments, any breach of any covenant under those instruments could result in all amounts outstanding
under any such instrument being accelerated and becoming due and payable. We may be unable to pay these debts in such
circumstances.

Any future debt agreements that we enter into may have covenants that are even more restrictive. The requirement that we
comply with these and any future provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market
conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital
expenditures, or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.

**_If we are unable to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants included in the Conditions of Issue, the Senior_**
**_Secured Facilities Agreements or any future debt agreements, there could be a default under such agreements, which_**
**_could result in an acceleration of repayment._**

As described in the preceding risk factor, the Conditions of Issue and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements contain,
and any future debt agreements we enter into may contain, certain financial and restrictive covenants. Our ability to comply
with these covenants, including meeting financial ratios and tests, depends on a number of factors, some of which may be
beyond our control, such as a deterioration of the industry and markets in which we operate or a deviation from the


-----

assumptions contained in our business plan. As a result, we may be unable to comply with our financial and restrictive
covenants, and any failure may materially adversely affect our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

The breach of a financial or other covenant or our failure to meet any of our obligations under any of the agreements
governing our debt may result in a default under such agreements, which in turn could result in a number of adverse
consequences including, prohibiting us from drawing additional funds under credit facilities, significant increases in
interest rates and other financing costs, the acceleration of all outstanding amounts under such agreements requiring us to
immediately repay the related debt in whole or in part, and/or the commencement of foreclosure or other enforcement
actions against any of our assets securing such debt. In addition, any default may expose us to requests by our suppliers for
advance payments for deliveries and a reduction or cancellation by credit insurers of their commitments. Defaults may also
trigger cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses contained in our other debt agreements, including the Conditions of
Issue and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, and our liquid funds and short-term cash flow may be insufficient to
service any of the debts in the circumstances described above. Accordingly, any failure by us to service our debts may have
a materially adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

A breach of any of the covenants under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements (including the Senior Secured Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, which includes a “spring-in” minimum EBITDA covenant for the benefit of the lenders under
the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or the occurrence of certain specified events will, subject to
applicable cure periods and other limitations, result in an event of default under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements.
Upon the occurrence of any event of default under any or all of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, the Majority
Lenders (being lenders under each relevant Senior Secured Facility whose commitments thereunder aggregate at least
66⅔% of the total commitments thereunder) could, while such event of default remains unremedied or unwaived, cancel
the commitments under the relevant Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and elect to declare all amounts outstanding
under the relevant Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In
addition, a default or event of default under the Conditions of Issue or under any of the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreements could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or
cross-acceleration provisions, including the Conditions of Issue.

If our creditors, including the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, accelerate the payment of amounts
owing to them under the relevant debt instruments, there can be no assurance that our assets and the assets of our
subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay those amounts in full, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries which would
be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable
to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any security interests granted to them to secure repayment of
those amounts.

**_The interests of 2029 Notes Holders may be inconsistent with those of 2031 Notes Holders._**

The 2031 Notes will have a different call schedule and call protection and will have other features that differ from the 2029
Notes. As a result of these differences, the interests of holders of the 2029 Notes could conflict with those of holders of the
2031 Notes. For example, the holders of one series of Notes may be in a position to agree to certain terms in a consent
solicitation that would be beneficial to such series of Notes but adverse to the economic interest of the other series of Notes;
however, under certain circumstances, to the extent an amendment or waiver is approved by the holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes, all holders will be bound by such amendment or waiver.

**_Our substantial leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our business._**

As we execute our various ongoing and proposed expansion projects and utilize the available facilities under our various
financing arrangements, we expect our indebtedness to increase over the next few years, and we have, and expect to
continue to have, increasingly significant debt service obligations. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements”,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Summary Consolidated
_Financial and Other Information”. We further have the ability to borrow an additional €200 million under our Senior_
Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering and
the redemption of the Existing Notes as described under “Use of Proceeds”, we would have had Pro Forma Senior Secured
Net Debt of €638.5 million and a ratio of Pro Forma Senior Secured Net Debt to EBITDA of 3.2x.

Our significant leverage could have important consequences to the Holders, including:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and liabilities;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment, the industry in which we operate and general adverse economic and industry conditions;


-----

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of,
and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, or other general corporate
purposes;

- restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment and
the industry in which we operate as well as our flexibility to maximize business opportunities;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- exposing us to increases in interest rates with respect to our floating rate debt instruments, such as the Senior
Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business
opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of any future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations
and financial condition, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations,
including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

Furthermore, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreements contain, and Conditions of Issue will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the
restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the
amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, under
the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant in each of the Conditions of Issue and the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreements we are permitted to make significant dividend payments and other distributions, which could also increase our
leverage. To the extent we become even more leveraged than anticipated or incur additional obligations, the risks described
above will intensify.

**_Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it_**
**_difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

The terms of the Conditions of Issue allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”. Certain of such additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future may rank senior to_
the Notes and the Guarantees, while certain other indebtedness that we may incur may rank pari passu with, be structurally
senior to, or be secured by assets that do not form part of the Collateral for, the Notes and the Guarantees. The Conditions
of Issue will permit subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors to incur additional debt in certain circumstances. In
the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding of any of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of such additional indebtedness will generally be
entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution
to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the additional creditors of
our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. Furthermore, if we or any of our subsidiaries incur additional debt that is secured by assets
that do not also secure the Notes, only the holders of that debt will be entitled to the proceeds from the enforcement of the
security created over such assets that do not also secure the Notes, whereas the noteholders would only share in any
proceeds distributed in connection with the enforcement into the remaining assets (de facto subordination). Any additional
indebtedness could also mature prior to the Notes. Although the Conditions of Issue will contain restrictions on the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions,
and the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In
addition, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and the Conditions of Issue will not prevent us from incurring
obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements. Furthermore, the Conditions of Issue will allow us
to designate some of our restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries if certain criteria are met. In this case, those
unrestricted subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the Conditions of Issue and
engage in other activities in which restricted subsidiaries may not engage. See “Description of the Notes” and “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements”. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks_
that we now face would increase.


-----

**_The borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Senior Secured Erste Group_**
**_Bank Facility Agreement may bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost_**
**_and debt and reducing our cash flow._**

A substantial part of our indebtness, including our borrowings under the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility
Agreement and potential future borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may be at
variable rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR, as adjusted periodically, plus a margin. We may also incur further
indebtedness in the future at variable rates of interest. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. Although
we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no
assurances that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. If interest
rates rise in the future, our interest expense associated with any variable rate obligations that are not hedged would increase,
even though the amounts borrowed would remain the same, reducing cash flow available to fund future operations, capital
expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, including satisfying our debt
service obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees. Neither the Conditions of Issue, the Senior Secured
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement nor any other Senior
Secured Facility Agreement contains a covenant requiring us to hedge all or a portion of our floating rate debt. Please also
see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and
_Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Interest rate risk”._

**_EURIBOR or other benchmarks may be discontinued or change in the future._**

Various interest rate benchmarks (including EURIBOR, which is the relevant benchmark for the facilities under our Senior
Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and for the facilities under our Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility
Agreement) have been the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some
reforms are already effective, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011), while others are still
to be implemented.

EURIBOR has been subject to recent reform to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements of a critical benchmark,
and there are no present plans to replace it with an alternative rate. However, similar future reforms and other pressures
may cause EURIBOR or other such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of
a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate
in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any of these reforms or pressures or any
other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, could affect
the level of the published rate. This includes a sudden or prolonged increase and/or more volatility than would otherwise
be, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.
Furthermore, if EURIBOR (or any of its successors or other benchmarks) is discontinued, that may require amendments to
the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement or
other documentation that references such rate. In relation to any of our obligations which have not transitioned to a
successor rate by the relevant date, the rate of interest applicable to such obligations may be determined for a period by
applicable fallback provisions, specified in the relevant documentation for such obligations. However, such provisions, if
they are dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations, may not operate as intended
(depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time).

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on_**
**_factors that may be beyond our control._**

Our ability to service, extend and refinance our debt and to fund future operations and capital expenditures is highly
dependent on our future operating performance and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow. To a significant degree,
our future operating performance and ability to generate cash flows is, in turn, dependent on various general economic,
financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors which are outside our control. See “—Risks Related
_to Our Industry and Our Business”. Due to any of these factors, we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from_
our operating activities and our anticipated sales growth, cost savings or operational efficiency improvements, and any
future debt or equity financing may not be available to us in amounts which would enable us to pay the principal premium
and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

A significant portion of the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements will mature prior to the Notes.
See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes”. To the extent our cash flow from
operating activities is insufficient to meet our liquidity needs and service our debt, we would have to seek additional debt
or equity financing. In addition, our subsidiaries may be restricted in certain jurisdictions within which they operate from
paying dividends or making other distributions to us. If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital
resources are insufficient to pay our various obligations as they mature or to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, we and our
subsidiaries may be forced, among other things, to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditure, sell assets,


-----

or forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses. There can be no assurance that any of these alternatives
can be accomplished on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. The terms of existing or future debt instruments
and the Conditions of Issue and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these
alternatives. Further, we may be compelled to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on
or before their maturity. We may face the additional risk that in order to refinance our debt, we could be required to agree
to more onerous covenants, which would further restrict our business operations. The occurrence of any event described
above may have a materially adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time as well as on
many factors outside of our control, including then prevailing conditions in the international credit and capital markets.
Part of the risk has already manifested itself in the course of 2022 due to the significant increase in the three-month
EURIBOR and SONIA rates. Due to the announcements of interest rate increases in 2023 by many central banks, the risk
of future interest rate increases is high. Against the background that central banks have been raising interest rates to counter
inflation, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenants. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, such as the Conditions of Issue and the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, may restrict us from pursuing refinancing alternatives. In addition, any failure to
make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction
of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

In the absence of operating results and resources sufficient to service our indebtedness we could face substantial liquidity
problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.
The terms of our indebtedness, including the terms of the Conditions of Issue and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements,
will restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and our ability to use the proceeds from any such disposal. We may not be
able to carry out certain disposals or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions,
and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations
then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations.

**RISKS RELATED TO THE NOTES**

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company that has limited business operations of its own. Consequently, payment of interest and
repayment of our indebtedness, including under the Notes, will be dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to make such
cash available to us, by either dividend distributions or intercompany loans, or both. Our subsidiaries may not be able to,
or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future indebtedness or by law in their ability to, make such dividend
distributions or advance upstream loans to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes.
Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may
limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

While the Conditions of Issue and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur
contractual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are
subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. We cannot assure you that arrangements with our subsidiaries,
the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our results of
operations and cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the
Notes.

In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make
required principal payments on the Notes and interest payments on the Notes. We do not expect to have any other sources
of funds that would allow us to make payments to the Holders.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to additional indebtedness that we may incur to the extent_**
**_such debt is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes._**

Although the Conditions of Issue restrict the Issuer’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pledge any assets as collateral
to secure other debt and require the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure the Notes equally and ratably if we pledge
any assets for the benefit of certain other debt, both the restriction on pledging assets or incurring liens and the requirement
to provide equal security to the Notes are subject to a number of significant exceptions and carve-outs. See “Description
_of the Notes—Covenants—Limitation on Liens”. For example, if the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries acquire assets_
subject to security interests securing other indebtedness, such security interests will be permitted to remain in place under
the terms of the Conditions of Issue and will not trigger a requirement to secure the Notes or Guarantees equally and
ratably. To the extent the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries pledges any assets for the benefit of other debt without
also securing the Notes, the Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to such debt to the extent of the
value of such assets. As a result of the foregoing, holders of (present or future) secured debt of the Issuer and its restricted


-----

subsidiaries may recover disproportionately more on their claims than the Holders in an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceeding, and the Issuer and the Guarantors may not have sufficient assets remaining to satisfy our obligations under the
Notes or the Guarantees, respectively.

**_The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Our non-Guarantor subsidiaries will not have any obligations to pay
amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims
of creditors of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors and preference shareholders (if any), will have priority
with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims
by Holders under the Notes or the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries,
holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets
of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each
Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any)
of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. In addition, the terms of the Conditions of Issue as well as our other indebtedness allow
the non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future, which will be structurally senior to the Notes. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes”.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the
Conditions of Issue and the terms of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, whether on or after the date the Notes are
first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect
the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.
Furthermore, a first-priority ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements (including registration requirements), statutory liens or re-characterization under
the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in
collateral. For example, because we operate in a market environment subject to production overcapacity from time to time,
it may be difficult for the Security Agent to sell our manufacturing facilities or other assets in an enforcement scenario.
The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent
may not be able to obtain any such consent. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given, when required,
to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those
assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under certain potential future “Super Senior Credit Facilities”,_**
**_Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the_**
**_Collateral sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes._**

From and following the Issue Date, the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the related Guarantees will be secured
on a first-ranking basis with security interests over Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreements, certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Liabilities. The Conditions of Issue also
permit the Collateral to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the
Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under certain potential future “Super Senior
Credit Facilities” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) as well as certain Priority Hedging Obligations and certain
Cash Management Liabilities will be settled first by application of any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral
pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure on the
Collateral, you may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then-outstanding claims under any such potential future
“Super Senior Credit Facilities” and such amount in respect of such Priority Hedging Obligations or such Cash
Management Liabilities are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by
any creditor will, after all obligations under such potential future “Super Senior Credit Facilties” and such amount in respect
of such certain Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries,
be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral on an equal basis with
the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who also serves as the security agent in relation to
the holders of the Notes, the obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, our hedging obligations, our Cash
Management Liabilities and any additional secured debt permitted to be incurred under the Conditions of Issue and the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

In general, the holders of the Notes and the agents under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any permitted future
senior secured debt, voting as provided below, will have, subject to certain restrictions, the ability to provide enforcement
instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the shared Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, where there
is an inconsistency between enforcement instructions provided by the holders of 66[2]/3% of the aggregate of all outstanding
liabilities under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging liabilities and cash management liabilities (the
“Majority Super Senior Creditors”) and the holders of more than 50% of the total “Majority Pari Passu Creditors”,
being the aggregate of the Notes and all liabilities outstanding under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any
other indebtedness sharing the Collateral on a first-ranking basis, the latter instructions will prevail. However, if and to the
extent the obligations under any potential future “Super Senior Credit Facility” and other super senior liabilities have not
been fully discharged within six months of the end of an initial consultation period or no enforcement action has been taken
within three months of such date or an insolvency event (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) occurs, the enforcement
instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. The lenders under any potential future “Super
Senior Credit Facility”, certain hedging counterparties and cash management providers may have interests that are different
from the interests of holders of the Notes, and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue
their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to
do so.

These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of other respects. Other creditors
not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against the Issuer or its subsidiaries during
such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the
value of certain Collateral could otherwise be impaired or reduced in value.

In addition, in certain circumstances, including acceleration of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements or the Notes, any
amounts recovered from the enforcement of Collateral or other asset sales will be required to be turned over to the Security
Agent. Subject to the prior payment of fees and expenses of the Holders’ Representative and Security Agent, the
Intercreditor Agreement requires the Security Agent to pay amounts turned over to it or otherwise received by it in respect
of the Notes, such as proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and other asset sales, to the lenders under any potential
future “Super Senior Credit Facility” and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and certain cash management
providers in priority to the holders of the Notes and lenders under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreements.

**_Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_**
**_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantee Agreement will provide that each guarantee in relation to each Guarantee and the Collateral will be limited
as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors and security providers (including those that
relate to general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, financial assistance or
thin-capitalization rules or other similar laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction). See
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security
_Interests”._

If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or security provider may have no liability or decreased
liability under its guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable
law.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court
could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s or security provider’s obligations under its guarantee or
Collateral, as applicable, (ii) direct that the recipient returns any amounts paid under a guarantee, or return any proceeds
received in connection with the enforcement of Collateral, to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for
the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors, or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically
if the court found that:

- the relevant guarantee was incurred, or the relevant Collateral was granted, with actual intent to give preference
to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or security
provider, as applicable, or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the guarantee or Collateral, as applicable,
has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor or security
provider, as applicable, was insolvent when it granted the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable;

- the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value
or corporate benefit for the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, and the Guarantor or security provider,
as applicable, was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as
applicable; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as
applicable; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at
maturity;


-----

- the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, was held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or
security provider, as applicable, or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor or
security provider, as applicable; or

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant guarantee or enforced or to be enforced under the relevant
Collateral, as applicable, was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar
laws may also apply to any future guarantee or Collateral granted by any of our subsidiaries pursuant to the
Guarantee Agreement.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider, as
applicable, was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not
determine that a Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent on the date its
guarantee was issued or Collateral was granted, as applicable, that payments to holders of the Notes, constituted
preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, under its guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, will be
limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, not constituting a preference, fraudulent
transfer or conveyance or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will
apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as applicable. There is a
possibility that the entire guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished.

If a court decided that a guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and
voided such guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you may cease to have
any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, and would be a creditor solely of the
Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor or security provider under the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as
applicable, that has not been declared void. In the event that any guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, is invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the guarantee or Collateral, as applicable,
obligations apply, the Notes, would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security
provider, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes, or any guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, is found
to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can repay in
full the amounts outstanding under the Notes.

See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and
_Security Interests”._

**_Enforcement of the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar
event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the Collateral will thus be subject to
the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies,
insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly
for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of
these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could
adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees. A
summary description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany and certain other jurisdictions are set out in
“Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security
_Interests”._

**_You may be required to pay a cash amount (“soulte”) in the event you decide to enforce the pledge over securities_**
**_granted under French law by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of securities rather than_**
**_by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to
it. Under French law, pledges over securities account may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either
(i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors)
or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged
securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owners of the pledged securities.
If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure),
the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined
either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a
contractual foreclosure.


-----

If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay the pledgor
a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the
secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a
subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors
will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will
be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law.
If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such
auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process
and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined
pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security_
_Interests—France—Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)”._

**_The insolvency laws of Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom may not be as favorable to you_**
**_as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes, from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and the United
Kingdom. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Germany, Poland,
the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom or any other relevant jurisdiction. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may
be complex and more costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the
enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency
and administrative laws of several jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce
your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of
organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United
States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain
post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call
into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights
under the Notes, and the related guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. For example,
under English insolvency law, among other powers, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the
court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes
that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue or constituted a preference,
each as defined in the relevant insolvency laws and in each case, where the action took place within the relevant time period
specified by those insolvency laws before the insolvency of the relevant entity.

For more information, regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees and security
interests in the Collateral, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability
_of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected in terms of validity, enforceability, ranking or otherwise
with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, the Security Agent or any other third party, fail or are unable to take the
actions (e.g., as for filing, registration, modification or other requirements) required to perfect any of these liens.
Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Holders’ Representative nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation
to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the Notes may fall within the scope of hardening periods for_**
**_such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, when issued, may fall within the scope of
hardening periods in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests
to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in
particular, because the Conditions of Issue and Intercreditor Agreement will permit the release and retaking of security
granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness.
The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has
been granted, perfected or recreated.


-----

Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective
hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. If the grantor of such
security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding-up proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or
security interest in the Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on
the Issue Date of being voided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or
otherwise set aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is
voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest.

The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the accession
of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their relevant assets and equity
interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, collateral granted in favor of holders of the Notes may not rank pari passu with_**
**_the collateral granted, lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and creditors of any other indebtedness_**
**_sharing the Collateral, and we are relying on the Intercreditor Agreement to achieve an equal priority lien in respect of_**
**_such collateral._**

Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, we will enter into new security documents over the collateral with respect to the
additional debt represented by the Notes. In certain jurisdictions, the security granted under those additional security
documents will, because they are being granted at a later point in time, rank junior to security interests in the collateral
granted in favor of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any other indebtedness sharing the Collateral. The
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the benefit of the first and junior ranking pledges over such collateral be shared
equally by the holders of all of the Notes, the lenders under our Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, hedge counterparties
in respect of certain hedging obligations, cash management providers and the other secured creditors. However, the
distribution of proceeds after an enforcement of the pledges (which are equalized under the law of obligations by the
Intercreditor Agreement and share equally in their ranking) is subject to super senior priority status accorded to certain
liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
_creditors under certain potential future “Super Senior Credit Facilities”, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash_
_Management Liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement procedure in_
_priority to the Notes” above. Therefore, the ranking of collateral granted in favor of holders of the Notes in such_
jurisdictions will depend on the enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, if the Intercreditor Agreement
is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the collateral granted
in favor of holders of the Notes in these jurisdictions may rank behind any other existing collateral, including collateral
granted in favor of the relevant lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements.

**_The Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral for the benefit of Holders of the Notes will be granted to the_**
**_Security Agent rather than directly to you._**

The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees of the Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes.
Instead, they will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent.

The Conditions of Issue provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Guarantees in accordance with the terms thereof. As a consequence,
holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests or Guarantee claims and will not be entitled to take enforcement
action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes or the Guarantees, except through the Holders’ Representative, who
will (on behalf of the holders of the Notes and subject to the provisions of the Conditions of Issue, the Guarantee Agreement
and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral or the Guarantees.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For example, the laws
of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public
auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to
whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a Security Document
will be validly secured. In certain jurisdictions, including, among others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence
governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the respective
Collateral will secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor
Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Notes directly. This
parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid
existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance
documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same
amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees


-----

(the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding
parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations.
Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the
full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions, including
Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to
enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security
interest on the part of the Security Agent.

In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent
which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of
the Collateral or Guarantees. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes, under which the Collateral and the_**
**_Guarantees may be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Holders’ Representative._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released automatically, including,
without limitation, the following:

- in connection with any sale, exchange or transfer (including by merger or otherwise) of Collateral to any person
other than the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary permitted under, and made in compliance with, the Conditions
of Issue;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes in accordance with the
Conditions of Issue;

- in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee (with respect to the Collateral granted by such
Guarantor);

- if a restricted subsidiary is designated to be an unrestricted subsidiary, the release of the property, assets and
capital stock of such restricted subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or discharge of the Conditions of Issue;

- as described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers”, “Description of the Notes—
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation” and “—Impairment of Security Interest”;_

- if the lien granted in favor of other indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the lien over such
Collateral is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge thereof);

- in connection with the granting or creation of certain “Permitted Liens”, including in connection with “Packaging
Park Projects”;

- with respect to the pledges over the shares in the Issuer and any Collateral in respect of receivables of the Parent
against the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, upon the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement
action) of any and all liens (other than “Permitted Liens”) over such Collateral securing indebtedness, so long as
no event of default exists at such time or would arise as a result of such release;

- with respect to any Collateral (other than pledges over the shares in the Issuer and any Collateral in respect of
receivables of the Parent against the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, insurance and intra-group receivables), upon
the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all liens (other than
“Permitted Liens”) over such Collateral securing indebtedness, so long as no event of default exists at such time
or would arise as a result of such release; provided that at the time of such release a Rating Triggering Period (as
defined in the Conditions of Issue) is in effect.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees, may be released automatically, including, without limitation, the
following:

- upon any sale, exchange or transfer (including by way of consolidation or merger) of ownership interests in the
Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that a Guarantor does not remain a restricted subsidiary,
or upon a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a
restricted subsidiary), in each case, otherwise not prohibited by the Conditions of Issue;


-----

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes, in accordance with the
Conditions of Issue;

- if a Guarantor is designated to be an unrestricted subsidiary;

- upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Conditions of Issue;

- upon the release of any guarantee of indebtedness that resulted in the creation of such guarantee under the
Conditions of Issue, so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor
does not guarantee certain other debt; and

- as described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”._

**_We may not be able to repay the Notes, when due or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to_**
**_certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the_**
**_Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._**

At final maturity of the Notes, or in the event of acceleration of the Notes, following an event of default including a cross
acceleration event, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes, will become due and payable. In addition, upon
the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of the Notes, may in certain circumstances require
the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued
but unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the
_Option of Holders upon a Change of Control”. The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for_
additional financing to pay these amounts when they become due.

The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a change of control event would
result in an event of default under the Notes. We cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay our
outstanding indebtedness which we would be required to prepay or offer to purchase or that became immediately due and
payable as a result. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases and we cannot assure
you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions in our other then-existing
contractual obligations may also restrict us from making such required repurchases.

A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of our then-existing indebtedness, and the
repurchase of the Notes, pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness even if the change of
control itself does not. The change of control provision contained in the Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting
power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Conditions of
Issue.

The definition of “change of control” contained in the Conditions of Issue includes a disposition of all or substantially all
the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a limited body of case law in some
jurisdictions interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
law and there is no German case law interpreting “all or substantially all” in the context of terms and conditions of high
yield notes or other debt instruments. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” the assets of the Issuer and its
restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and
whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Certain amendments to the Conditions of Issue may be passed with the consent of 90% of less than the majority of the_**
**_Notes outstanding._**

The Conditions of Issue, may be amended by a vote of the holders of the Notes. Amendments require a majority of not less
than 50.1% of votes cast or, for certain amendments, 90% of the votes cast as opposed to 50.1% or 90%, respectively, of
the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding. Certain further amendments to the Conditions of Issue, require
approval of 100% of the holders of the Notes. The voting process under the Conditions of Issue will be governed in
accordance with the German Act on Debt Securities of 2009 (Gesetz über Schuldverschreibungen aus Gesamtemissionen,
_Schuldverschreibungsgesetz, SchVG), pursuant to which the quorum for noteholder votes is principally set at a simple_
majority. Accordingly, the aggregate principal amount of Notes required to vote in favor of an amendment will vary based
on the noteholder votes participating. For example, if the holders of less than 55.5% of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes participate in a vote, any proposed amendment, including amendments subject to the 90% threshold, can be


-----

passed with less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes consenting. See “Description of the Notes—
_Amendments and Waivers”._

**_You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations._**

The Issuer is incorporated in Germany. The Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated in the Czech Republic, Germany,
Poland and the United Kingdom. Each member of our management team and the directors and executive officers of the
Guarantors are non-residents of the United States, and all of our assets and the assets of the Guarantors and such persons
are located outside the United States. It may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United
States upon the Issuer, a Guarantor or such persons or to enforce against any of them in U.S. courts judgments predicated
upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, and there is doubt as to the
enforceability in the home jurisdictions of the other Guarantors of civil liabilities predicated upon the federal securities
laws of the United States, either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts. It may also
not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or those persons
under the Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters and the
German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security,
particularly if such service violated the German Constitutional Law (Grundgesetz). If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court
against the Issuer or any Guarantor or a security provider, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions
where the relevant company has assets. As all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the assets of its and their
directors are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts
against us or them. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

None of the Notes or the Guarantees have been, or will be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws
of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States, except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act
and the applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction. See “Transfer Restrictions”. It is the obligation of
holders of Notes to ensure that their purchase and any subsequent transfer of the Notes within the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. Any of these restrictions and requirements will limit the ability of
investors to resell the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited._**

The Notes will be new securities for which there is no market. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market for
the Notes, your ability to sell your Notes, or the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates,
our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has
been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The
liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities
and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject
to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects
and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes.
The Initial Purchasers are not, however, obliged to do so, and they may discontinue any market-making activities at any
time without notice. As a result, there is no assurance that an active trading market will develop for the Notes. If no active
trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange._**

Although the Issuer will, in the Conditions of Issue, agree to use its reasonable best efforts to have the Notes listed on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) within a reasonable period after the Issue Date and to
maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Notes will become or
remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of the Exchange or it becomes unduly burdensome
to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing, provided that it will use reasonable
best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance
that the Issuer will be able to do so. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any time, without
the consent of the Holders or the Holders’ Representative, de-list the Notes from any stock exchange for the purposes of
moving the listing of the Notes to another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be a stock exchange
that is not regulated by the European Union).

Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Exchange or
another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Conditions of Issue, failure to be


-----

approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of
the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Conditions of Issue
may have a material effect on a Holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

**_The interests of Holders of the Notes may be inconsistent with those of the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit_**
**_Facilities Agreements._**

Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities Agreements have different maturity dates, prepayment schedules and prepayment
provisions and will have other features that differ from the corresponding terms in the Conditions of Issues governing the
Notes. As a result of these differences, the interests of holders of the Notes could conflict with those of the lenders under
our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. For example, the lenders under one or more of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Agreements may be in a position to agree to certain amendments that would be beneficial to them but adverse to the
economic interest of the Holder of the Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes offered hereby are denominated and payable in euro. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a
currency other than euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange risks related to, among other factors,
possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which you measure the return
on your investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the
euro against the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments could cause a decrease in the
effective yield of the Notes below the stated coupon rate and could result in a loss to you when the return on the Notes is
translated into the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments. There may be tax
consequences for you as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from an investment in the Notes. See
“Taxation—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision,_**
**_suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

The Notes have been assigned credit ratings by S&P and Moody’s. The credit ratings address our ability to perform our
obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when
due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional
risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time.
No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will
not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances so warrant. A
suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the
Notes.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Conditions of Issue provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Notes receive a rating of “BBB−” or better
from S&P's and “Baa3” or better from Moody’s and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then
beginning that day and continuing until such time that the Notes receive a rating of below “BBB−” from S&P's and below
“Baa3” from Moody’s, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants”. If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur_
additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of
holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes, will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any
such rating will be maintained.

**_The Notes will be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems_**
**_to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Clearstream Banking. Interests in the
global notes will be recorded in book-entry form only. Ownership of interests in each global note will be limited to persons
who have accounts with Clearstream Banking or persons who hold interests through participants. The global notes
representing the Notes will be deposited with Clearstream Banking. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts
owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft as
Paying Agent, which will make payments to Clearstream Banking. Clearstream Banking will, in turn, distribute those
payments to its participants that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes in accordance with its
procedures and these payments will be credited by such participants to indirect participants for the benefit of the holders
of the co-ownership interests (Miteigentumsanteile) in the Notes represented by each global note. After payment to


-----

Clearstream Banking, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts in
respect of the Notes. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Clearstream
Banking and, if you are not a participant in Clearstream Banking, on the procedures of the participant through which you
own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the Conditions of Issue. See “Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form”._

**OVERVIEW**

We are a leading, family-owned producer and supplier of containerboard and corrugated board in Central Europe and are
headquartered in Landau, Germany. According to Vision Hunters, we are the third largest producer of corrugated board in
Europe (by production capacity) through our corrugated board business (“Board”) and the fifth largest producer of recycled
containerboard in Europe (by production capacity) through our containerboard business (“Paper”). We focus on the highly
efficient production and processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of corrugated board sheets
for our mostly family-owned box manufacturing customers. In this core market segment, we are the market leader by
volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands, according to Vision Hunters,
and following significant recent and ongoing investments, we have also been becoming a significant market player in Italy
and the United Kingdom. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated paper
and packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that bring added-value to our


-----

customers in the packaging industry, i.e., the automated and integrated production of containerboard and corrugated board.
Our customers serve various end markets, including industrial/manufacturing, consumer durables, processed foods, nonfood manufactured consumer goods and fresh food. Unlike many fully integrated market players, we do not produce boxes
and therefore do not compete with our box manufacturing customers but instead focus solely on the production of
containerboard and corrugated board. We are part of the circular economy as the end products made with our corrugated
board and containerboard can serve as raw materials in our business after use by the end customer. In addition, we thermally
utilize foreign materials present in the recovered paper we use as a our main raw material as well as production residues
from our paper manufacturing processes in our waste-to-energy plant. This enables us to generate the steam required for
paper production at PM2 as well as a portion of our electricity requirements ourselves. In our paper mills, we almost
exclusively use recovered paper as a raw material for the production of containerboard. We use containerboard made from
recovered paper as much as possible in our corrugated board formats. This enables us to reduce the use of virgin fiber paper
(kraftliner) and thereby the amount of virgin pulp used in the production of our corrugated board.

Through our large scale and highly flexible production, built up primarily via a greenfield approach and, more recently,
via packaging park projects, we are able to realize significant economies of scale. Since we commenced operations in 1992,
we have carefully selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a
greenfield strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we operate.
As a result, we believe we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high technological standards,
resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and relatively low requirements for additional
capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the high technological standards of our production facilities, we
believe we are well-positioned to benefit from major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for lightweight packaging, (ii) the increasing importance of small-size packaging due to the growing importance of e-commerce,
and (iii) the general trend towards a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and energy, which can help reduce
costs, CO2 emissions and fresh water consumption.

Our core business comprises Paper and Board. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible containerboard production
using almost exclusively recovered paper, with high output volumes to increase cost efficiency and short delivery times.
Following the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up of our third and newest paper machine (PM3)
in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, Paper has the capacity to meet the majority of the containerboard sourcing requirements
of our corrugated board production within Board (i.e., we are currently a net seller of containerboard). We believe that a
high degree of vertical integration and the ability of Board to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in
a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. In addition, our customers benefit
from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options.

Paper manufactures containerboard at our three paper mills in Germany, with an envisaged total annual production capacity
of approximately 1,850,000 tons of containerboard. Our three existing paper machines, PM1 in Burg, PM2 in
Eisenhüttenstadt and PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, have complementary production layouts which allow us to produce
brown containerboard with grammages between 60 to 230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recovered paper. This, in turn,
allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the appropriate widths for Board’s twelve
existing corrugated board plants in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a
total annual production capacity of approximately 1,815,000 tons of corrugated board, including our latest corrugated board
“mega plant” (PW14) at Strykow, Poland with an annual corrugated board production acpacity of approximately 200,000
tons, which started commercial production in January 2023. Our historic greenfield location strategy ensures close customer
proximity and high production flexibility. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we further acquired Progroup
Power 1 GmbH, the waste-to-engery plant adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt and certain related assets. As a


-----

result, we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2
ourselves (“Power”). In addition, we already started construction of a further waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) at the site of
PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, to supply our paper machine PM3 with the majority of the required process heat as well as a
significant portion of the required electricity.

In 2023, we sold approximately 1,494,000 tons of corrugated board and approximately 403,000 tons of containerboard to
external customers across Europe, resulting in external corrugated board and containerboard sales, respectively, of
€1,129.8 million (85.6% of total sales) and €166.7 million (12.6% of total sales). Paper’s total sales in 2023 include
€7.6 million (0.6% of total sales) in revenues from the incineration of waste at our existing waste-to-energy plant in
Eisenhüttenstadt. Total external sales by Board and Paper in 2023 (including sales other than corrugated board or
containerboard sales, respectively, such as revenues from incineration of waste at our waste-to-energy plant) amounted to
€1,136.7 million (86.1% of total sales) and €167.8 million (12.7% of total sales). Our total sales and EBITDA in 2023
amounted to €1,320.0 million and €200.8 million, respectively. Sales in Germany (by destination), our core market,
accounted for 35% of total sales and 34% of sales by volume in 2023.

Primarily to support our core business, Paper and Board, we have established our own logistics operations, including a
fleet of currently 59 trucks (“Logistics”). Most of the remaining €15.5 million in sales (1.2% of total sales) in 2023 were
generated by Logistics.

Founded in 1991, we are indirectly majority-owned by Jürgen Heindl, our founder and vice chairman of our supervisory
board (the “Supervisory Board”), Maximilian Heindl, our chief executive officer and Vinzenz Heindl.

**KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

We principally generate revenue through the sale of containerboard and corrugated board. We sell our corrugated board
only to third-party customers in the packaging industry. Our mills primarily supply the containerboard we produce to
Group-owned corrugated board plants; however, only third-party sales are reflected in our revenue. We also sell, to a lesser
degree, containerboard to third parties, and these third-party sales of containerboard have increased significantly in the
periods under review following the start-up and ongoing ramp-up of our newest paper machine (PM3) in SandersdorfBrehna, Germany in August 2020. In 2023, corrugated board sales and external containerboard sales accounted for 85.6%
and 12.6%, respectively, of our total sales.

Key factors that affect our operating results are:

  - changes in demand and industry production capacity;

  - the cost of recovered paper, other raw materials and other costs of manufacturing;

  - changes in energy costs, both as a result of market price movements and regulatory changes, including energy tax
refund schemes and other statutory accommodations for energy intensive industries;

  - changes in freight and transportation costs;

  - our ability to pass on price increases in raw materials and other input costs into the prices we charge for third-party
sales of containerboard and corrugated board;


-----

  - the performance and the utilization of our production sites as well as the performance of certain facilities owned
and operated by us, such as our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt;

  - currency exchange rate movements;

  - the level of vertical integration between Paper and Board;

  - our ability to successfully complete ongoing and future expansion projects; and

  - our ability to achieve cost savings.

Because many of these factors are beyond our control and certain of these factors have historically been volatile, past
performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance and it is difficult to predict future performance with any
degree of certainty.

**Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input Costs**

_Fluctuations in Demand and Industry Capacity_

Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity. Increased levels of economic
growth and activity typically result in higher per capita use of packaging materials, both with respect to transportation of
goods and consumer presentation. This increase in the use of packaging materials (including paper-based packaging
materials), in turn, results in an increase in the demand for our recycled containerboard and corrugated board products.
Because the markets for containerboard and corrugated board products in the developed economies in which we primarily
operate are generally mature, historically there has been a close correlation between general economic growth and demand
for packaging products such as corrugated containers and, therefore, for their component materials such as containerboard
and corrugated board. Accordingly, our industry is affected by economic conditions in our markets, including changes in
national, regional and local unemployment levels, shifts in consumer spending patterns, credit availability, and business
and consumer confidence. Disruptions in the overall economy and volatility in the financial markets have similarly reduced
consumer confidence and negatively affected consumer spending in the recent past, which has been harmful to our financial
position and results of operations. We have been impacted by difficult economic conditions in the past. The COVID-19
pandemic, for example, resulted in lower demand for our products in the second quarter of 2020, in particular, which led
to price reductions in the third quarter of 2020. At the same time, the price for our main raw material, recovered paper,
increased partly due to limited access to recovered paper because of reduced collection levels. Similarly, our sales decreased
significantly in 2023, compared to 2022, mainly as a result of a significant drop in the sales prices for our products due to
the weakening market environment following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These macroeconomic developments had
a significant negative impact on our margins and results of operations in 2020 and 2023, in particular. Less developed
economies, including those in Eastern Europe, have a lower per capita consumption of packaging materials and therefore
also of containerboard and corrugated board products but also, as a result, have the potential for higher growth as per capita
consumption of packaging materials increases towards levels of developed economies.

To a lesser degree, demand for corrugated containers and their component materials, including our containerboard and
corrugated board, is affected by changes in their market prices. Significant increases in the price of corrugated containers
have, on occasion, resulted in decreased demand as end-customers elected to purchase substitute products, such as reusable
plastic containers, wooden crates or shrink-wrap.

Historically, prices for containerboard and corrugated board have tended to be cyclical. This cyclicality has resulted from
significant imbalances in supply and demand for containerboard. On the one hand, containerboard production capacity
cannot be readily adapted to reflect changing market conditions due to the high capital intensity of paper production
facilities and the long lead time between the planning and construction of a new containerboard mill. On the other hand,
significant containerboard and corrugated board price reductions and inventory growth have resulted when capacity has
exceeded demand. In the past, many leading paper manufacturers have reacted to reduced demand by taking downtimes
and by rationalizing high-cost and inefficient capacity. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, energy prices rose so
sharply in most European countries that the market price level for containerboard was not sufficient to cover these high
costs. This led to numerous shutdown measures in the industry in 2022 and 2023. While we did not initiate any marketrelated downtimes at our own facilities, we also restricted the production of containerboard during this period, as the sale
of hedged energy volumes was more profitable than the production of containerboard in this exceptional situation. Market
demand was very weak in 2023, meaning that operating rates in the containerboard industry were significantly lower than
normal, resulting in many high-priced suppliers cut their production at the lower market prices, which suggests that they
were unable to cover their costs at these prices.


-----

_Fluctuations in Raw Material Costs_

Because the primary raw material for the production of recycled containerboard is recovered paper, the price of which
tends to fluctuate, our three recycled containerboard mills (i.e., our paper machines PM1, PM2 and PM3) can experience
temporary increases and decreases in profits. Our paper mills have historically generated on average relatively high
margins, in part because we primarily sell our containerboard to our own corrugated board plants. As a result of the steady
expansion of our corrugated board production capacity over the years, internal containerboard sales to Board had increased
steadily from approximately 71% (or 83%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard
sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to approximately 87% (or 96%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of
the total sales, by volume, of Paper in 2019. This meant that we had accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals
and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between
Paper and Board and had even temporarily become a net purchaser of containerboard, i.e., the recycled containerboard
sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board significantly exceeded the internal supply
capacities of Paper. With the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up at our third and newest paper
machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, with an annual capacity of approximately 750,000 tons of
containerboard, the volume of our external containerboard sales significantly increased again. As a result, internal
containerboard sales to Board decreased to approximately 82% (or 92%, if we include containerboard sales to swap
partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2020, approximately 75% (or 87%, if we include
containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2021 and approximately 75% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap
partners) in 2022. Due to the further ramp-up of PM3, internal containerboard sales to Board as a percentage of total
containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper remained fairly stable at approximately 74% (or 85%, if we include
containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2023. We expect that (i) the start of commercial production in January 2023 and
ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated
board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, (ii) the expected start of test production in the first half of 2024
and subsequent ramp-up at our proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, and (iii) our
further proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy alone will lead to a significant further increase
in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we expect to be operating again at the top end of our long-term target
corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board and again become a net purchaser of
containerboard in the mid-term. For more details on our expansion projects and investment program, see also“—Expansion
_Projects and Investment Program” below._

Our overall profitability is also affected by the length of time it takes us to translate price increases in raw materials and
other input costs into prices we charge for third-party sales of containerboard and corrugated board. To the extent our
containerboard is sold internally, our profitability will only be affected by the ability to recover any price increases from
third-party sales of corrugated board to our third-party customers in the packaging industry. Furthermore, to the extent that
selling prices fall, if we are unable to generate cost savings through producing products more efficiently or lower our fixed
costs, our results may be negatively affected.

An important driver of recovered paper prices is the balance of supply and demand for paper products in general as well
as collection rates of recovered paper. When the price of recovered paper increases, containerboard manufacturers attempt
to raise their prices to preserve profit margins, which generally narrow as a result of higher raw material costs. It typically
takes approximately two to three months for mills to pass on their raw material price increases to corrugated board
manufacturers. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard
cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for these manufacturers, including us, to pass these
increases on to the respective customers, although the extent and speed with which we are able to pass on cost increases to
our customers, if at all, can vary significantly, depending on prevailing market conditions.

In a down cycle, as recovered paper prices fall, manufacturers of paper and paper-based packaging products (including
manufacturers of containerboard and corrugated board) attempt to maintain prices. In the past, we have typically been able
to maintain our prices for two to three months in such a down cycle. As a result, the effect of price fluctuations on our mills
and corrugated board operations varies, depending on the relevant point in the industry cycle. During periods of rising
containerboard prices, our profitability can therefore be adversely affected. Conversely, during periods of declining
containerboard prices, our profitability can be positively affected.

However, our ability to pass the costs of our raw materials and other input costs on to our packaging customers depends
on a number of other factors, including the supply and demand balance for containerboard and corrugated board in a
particular region and the ability of our customers to maintain or increase prices with their own customers. We generate
almost all of our sales through purchase orders from our customers based on our price lists which we adjust in response to
market price movements and only have very few contracts with our customers which provide minimum purchase
obligations and/or pricing clauses that would allow us to automatically pass increased costs on to our customers. As a result
of these factors, there can be no guarantee that the price of recovered paper and the prices for our containerboard and
corrugated board products will always be closely correlated. Any extended mismatch between the price of recovered paper
and the market prices for our products could have a significant effect on our margins and overall profitability.


-----

The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, resulted in lower demand for our products in the second quarter of 2020, in
particular, which led to price reductions in the third quarter of 2020. At the same time, the prices for our main raw material,
recovered paper, increased in the second quarter of 2020, partly due to limited access to recovered paper because of reduced
collection levels. After a normalized market situation with price declines in the third quarter of 2020, a stronger demand
for recovered paper due to new capacity additions in the European market for containerboard, including our own paper
machine PM3, led to price increases for recovered paper starting in October 2020. Although a tighter supply situation and
strong demand caused prices for containerboard to increase again in the fourth quarter of 2020, corrugated board prices
only followed the development of containerboard prices in the first quarter of 2021 with the usual timelag. As a result, our
EBITDA Margin decreased from 25.2% in 2019 to 20.2% in 2020, and our EBITDA decreased from €223.2 million in
2019 to €178.1 million in 2020, notwithstanding strong increases in the volume of both our containerboard sales and
corrugated board sales in 2020 compared to 2019.

The price increases for recovered paper which started in October 2020 continued until April 2021. From May 2021
onwards, recovered paper prices remain largely stable, before a slight increase in September and October 2021, followed
by a decrease in November 2021 and a sideways movement in December 2021. The price increases for recycled
containerboard which had started in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by a robust demand and the increasing recovered
paper prices, continued throughout the year 2021. Overall, prices for our recycled containerboard increased significantly
by €270 per ton between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2021, with corrugated board prices following
this development of containerboard prices with a time lag. As a result of these developments, our EBITDA Margin
remained largely unchanged at 20.1% in 2021, compared to 20.2% in 2020, although it was significantly higher at 23.6%
in the fourth quarter of 2021. Notwithstanding our largely unchanged EBITDA Margin, our EBITDA increased
significantly from €178.1 million in 2020 to €273.2 million in 2021, due to a significant increase in sales driven by (i)
strong volume growth of both containerboard sales (due to higher production capacity following the commencement of
production at PM3 at the end of August 2020) and corrugated board sales (due to the successful ramp-up of production of
our corrugated board production site PW13 in Eisfeld, Germany following commencement of commercial production in
the first quarter of 2020), as well as (ii) the significantly higher price levels of both containerboard and corrugated board
in 2021 compared to 2020.

In the first two quarters of 2022, recovered paper prices initially continued to increase due to stable demand and higher
cargo and energy costs. However, recovered paper prices peaked in the third quarter of 2022, before falling significantly
by 52.4% over the course of the fourth quarter of 2022 due to low demand in Europe, which could not be compensated by
exports of recovered paper. Similarly the price levels for both containerboard and corrugated board continued to rise in the
first half of 2022, before falling significantly from the end of the third quarter of 2022. Notwithstanding the challenging
market environment, our EBITDA reached €412.0 million in 2022, compared to €273.2 million in 2021, as a result of
higher sales and higher margins due to the significantly higher price levels for both containerboard and corrugated board
in 2022 and supported by our energy hedges, which mitigated the significantly higher market prices for energy following
the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Following the sharp decline in recovered paper prices in 2022, recovered paper prices
rose slightly from their lows at the beginning of 2023 until the middle of the year. In the second half of 2023, the trend was
mixed, with a further slight increase towards the end of 2023. In the first four months of 2023, containerboard prices
continued the sharp downward trend of the fourth quarter of 2022. Prices stabilized in the period from May to October
2023 before taking another downward step in November 2023. Due to the very sharp change in containerboard prices at
the beginning of the year, corrugated board prices followed this trend very quickly. As a result, the time lag in this phase
was less than the usual two to three months before a change in containerboard prices was reflected in corrugated board
prices. In this very challenging market environment, EBITDA fell very quickly from the previous year's very high figure
and totalled €200.8 million for the full year 2023. See also “—Fluctuations in Energy Costs” below. Our EBITDA Margin
reached 15.2% in 2023 compared to 23.4% in 2022 and 20.1% in 2021.

_Fluctuations in Energy Costs_

Another important input for us is energy. Our production processes, in particular the production of containerboard at our
three mills, are energy intensive. We produce a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper
machine PM2 ourselves, with our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt, and we have commenced construction
of a further waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) at the site of PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, to supply our paper machine PM3
with the majority of the required process heat as well as a significant portion of the required electricity. We currently expect
this second waste-to-energy plant to start operating in mid-2025. At full capacity utilization, generating the required process
heat for the operation of our paper machine PM3 would currently require an annual consumption of up to 800 GWh of
natural gas, with an average spot price for natural gas in Germany between 2015 and 2024 of approximately €35 per MWh.
In addition, PPO2 has an envisaged annual electricity production capacity of approximately 100 to 120 GWh, which we
currently need to purchase at market prices, with an average spot price for electricity in Germany between 2015 and 2024
of approximately €70 per MWh. We therefore believe we are able to generate sizable savings in energy costs from the
operation of PPO2 and a corresponding increase in EBITDA. However, our production processes are nevertheless reliant,
and will continue to be reliant, on third parties for the supply of energy. Energy costs, including costs for electricity, gas
and steam, represent our second largest purchasing cost item, accounting for 22.4% of our cost of materials in 2023,


-----

compared to 20.0% of our cost of materials in 2022, and 13.0% of our cost of materials in 2021. Market prices for energy,
in particular for electricity, oil and natural gas, have historically been volatile and have had a corresponding effect on our
production costs. The ongoing inflationary surge in 2022 and 2023 as well as the geopolitical uncertainty, partially due to
the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and the continuing violence in Gaza and surrounding countries, may contribute to
further market unpredictability in the future and may increase the degree of volatility in the prices for energy in the future.
For example, as a result of the Russia invasion in Ukraine, energy prices reached multi-year highs in 2022. There can be
no assurances that we will not face significant increased energy costs for, or disruptions in energy supplies to our sites in
the future. Any interruption or shortage of energy supply or our inability to pass through rising energy costs could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As a result, we have undertaken
significant efforts in recent years to decrease our energy consumption and costs throughout our business. For further
information, see “Business—Procurement/Purchasing—Energy” and “Business—Sustainability Focus; Research and
_Development”._

The key drivers of our energy expenses have been, and will continue to be, fluctuations in the market prices for energy, the
performance of our existing waste-to-energy plant adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt and the proposed further
waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) currently under construction at the site of PM3 and Sandersdorf-Brehna as well as regulatory
decisions.

Our energy costs increased significantly from €64.7 million in 2020 to €107.5 million in 2021, due to higher energy
consumption following the start-up in late August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up of our new paper machine (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany as well as higher market prices for energy. Although energy prices reached multi-year highs
in 2022 as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this only had a slight impact on our results of operation until the end
of 2022, as we had entered into long-term contracts for the majority of our energy requirements in previous years, at prices
that were significantly below market prices for energy in 2022. Nevertheless, our energy costs increased from €107.5
million in 2021 to €203.3 million in 2022. However, both as a result of weaker internal and external demand and the very
high energy spot price levels, we decided to curtail production, in particular at our newest paper machine PM3, in the third
quarter of 2022. In the first and second quarter of 2023, energy prices declined from the multi-year highs in 2022, and
energy prices remained on a similar level in the second half of 2023. Overall, energy prices were significantly lower during
2023 compared to 2022, and due to our moderate hedging levels for 2023, we benefited from the lower spot market prices
in 2023. As a result, our energy costs decreased from €203.3 million in 2022 to €179.0 million in 2023.

Any extended shutdowns of our waste-to-energy plants may also have a negative impact on our results of operations. For
example, shortly after our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt was put back into operation following a
regular, scheduled maintenance shutdown, an operator error caused blockages inside the plant, which required a further
unplanned shutdown of the plant for a period of about three weeks in October 2023 to clear the blockages. This unplanned
shutdown resulted in approximately €5.7 million in items of exceptional size or incidence, including approximately
€0.3 million in additional maintenance expenses and €5.4 million in lost sales and additional production costs.

In addition to fluctuations in the market prices for energy and the performance of our waste-to-energy plants, in Germany,
our core market where all three of our mills are located, energy costs have further been strongly impacted by regulatory
decisions related to the so-called “Energiewende”, a significant shift in government policy following the nuclear accident
in Fukushima, Japan in 2011. This German energy policy focuses on promoting the development of renewable energy
sources and, among other developments, has already resulted in the complete cessation of the production of nuclear power
in Germany. To mitigate the impact of the resulting significant increases in electricity prices for energy-intensive industries,
the German government adopted rules that provide for various businesses, including us, to be reimbursed for certain energyrelated taxes and/or infrastructure investment surcharges necessary for the implementation of the “Energiewende”.
However, such rules have not only been subject to challenges in German courts and EU scrutiny as potentially illegal
subsidies, but also continue to be the subject of political scrutiny by various interest groups. There is no guarantee that they
will not change again or that we will continue to be able to benefit from current accommodations, reimbursement rules
and/or energy tax refund schemes.

As a result of the significant increases in production volumes in recent years, in particular following the start-up in late
August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up of our new paper machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, our total energy
consumption has increased significantly in recent years. However, at the same time, our energy consumption per ton of
output has decreased for a variety of reasons, including (i) our efforts to reduce energy consumption, (ii) the optimization
of our energy procurement processes and (iii) the optimization of the operating costs of our existing waste-to-energy plan
in Eisenhüttenstadt. Specifically, energy consumption per ton of output of Paper decreased by 5.4% between 2012 and
2022, while energy consumption per ton of output of Board decreased by 14.6% during the same period. In addition, we
were able to reduce energy costs through the full utilization of all available accommodations, credits and refunds under
applicable energy laws and regulations. For more information about our energy management efforts, see “—Sustainability
_Focus; Research and Development”._

_Fluctuations in Freight/Logistics Costs_

Our production operations require us to coordinate and monitor complex logistical processes between each step of our
internal value chain and our production processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and products. This includes the
shipment of large rolls of containerboard from our three paper mills in Germany to our twelve corrugated board plants in
the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom as well as the shipment of our finished
corrugated board to our customers in the packaging industry (box plants). We meet our freight and logistics requirements
mainly through the use of external logistics companies and, to a much lesser extent, our own fleet of currently 59 trucks.
Due to the relatively large size and weight of our products compared to value, freight and logistics expenses play an
important role in our business, and fluctuations in freight prices can have a significant impact on our profitability.

**Currency Fluctuations**

Given the growing geographic spread of our operations, we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
For example, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and Poland do not use the euro as their national currency. During
the year ended December 31, 2023, 18%, 10% and 4% of our total sales derived from sales in Polish zloty, British pound
and Czech koruna, respectively. We expect the percentage of our total sales derived in Polish zloty, in particular, to further
increase as a result of the start of commercial production in January 2023 and ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated
board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland.

As a result, fluctuations in the value of local currencies against the euro have had, and may have in the future, a significant
effect on our operations and on our reported results in euro and the comparability of our performance between financial
periods can be significantly affected by fluctuations in local currencies against the euro. We have implemented foreign
currency risk management in order to monitor our foreign currency risk and to enable us to consider taking action if we
decide to do so, but there is no assurance that such measures will be effective.

The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar is also important for the European containerboard industry, because
exports from the European market influence the balance of supply and demand and the price development of containerboard
in Europe. Movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rate may also have an effect on trading, because a strong U.S. dollar
tends to make U.S. dollar exports less competitive, while a weak euro may create export opportunities for European
containerboard producers, which can reduce containerboard supplies in the European market and promote price stability.
Conversely, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has historically resulted in lower (U.S. dollar-denominated) exports
by European containerboard manufacturers with a negative (for our business) effect on the supply and demand balance and
an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has,
in the past, also resulted in lower sales by other European manufacturers who ship products in corrugated packaging,
resulting in lower European demand for corrugated packaging and, therefore, lower demand for our containerboard and
corrugated board. A weak U.S. dollar may also result in additional competition in the European market from U.S.
manufacturers that have an incentive to sell more products in Europe, due to increased European demand for the relatively
lower-priced U.S. goods over higher-priced European goods.

**Significant Synergies through High Degree of Vertical Integration between Paper and Board**

In 2023, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for approximately 76% of the containerboard, by volume, used by
our corrugated board production within Board. As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production
capacity over the years, internal containerboard sales to Board had increased steadily from approximately 71% (or 83%, if
we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to
approximately 87% (or 96%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume,
of Paper in 2019. This meant that we had accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been
operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board
and had even temporarily become a net purchaser of containerboard, i.e., the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements
of our corrugated board production within Board significantly exceeded the internal supply capacities of Paper. With the
start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up at our third and newest paper machine (PM3) in SandersdorfBrehna, Germany, with an annual capacity of approximately 750,000 tons of containerboard, the volume of our external
containerboard sales significantly increased again. As a result, internal containerboard sales to Board decreased to
approximately 82% (or 92%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume,
of Paper in 2020, approximately 75% (or 87%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2021 and
approximately 75% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2022. Due to the further ramp-up of
PM3, internal containerboard sales to Board as a percentage of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper remained
fairly stable at approximately 74% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2023. We expect that
(i) the start of commercial production in January 2023 and ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant”
(PW14) in Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, (ii) the
expected start of test production in the first half of 2024 and subsequent ramp-up at our proposed corrugated board “mega
plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, and (iii) our further proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto,


-----

Italy alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will again be
operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board
and again become a net purchaser of containerboard in the mid-term. For more details on our expansion projects and
investment program, see also“—Expansion Projects and Investment Program” below.

With an envisaged total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 1,850,000 tons, Paper produced approximately
1,574,000 tons and 1,607,000 tons of containerboard in 2023 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, approximately
1,153,000 tons were sold internally to Board (2021: 1,187,000 tons of internal containerboard sales), and a further
approximately 163,000 tons were sold pursuant to swap agreements with other containerboard producers (2021:
194,000 tons of sales to swap partners), which allow us to reduce transportation costs, optimize our production program
and swap internally produced containerboard for certain containerboard grades we do not produce in sufficient quantities,
such as kraftliner. The remaining approximately 241,000 tons of containerboard we sold in 2023 were sold externally
(2021: approximately 206,000 tons of external containerboard sales, excluding sales to swap partners). With a total annual
corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,815,000 tons (including 200,000 tons of capacity of our new
corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, which commenced commercial production in January 2023,
but excluding a further 200,000 tons of capacity of our proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg,
Germany, which is expected to commence production in the second quarter of 2024 (2021: total annual corrugated board
production capacity of approximately 1,615,000 tons), Board produced approximately 1,494,000 tons of containerboard in
2023, compared to approximately 1,504,000 tons of corrugated board in 2021. We believe that a high degree of vertical
integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient
and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. At the same time, we believe that the high share
of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or improve our overall Group margins by reducing our exposure to
lower or more volatile margins (compared to corrugated board margins) of certain external containerboard sales. Our
customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery, consistently high quality as
well as the possibility for online ordering and tracking options. The steady increase in the degree of vertical integration
between Paper and Board over the last few years has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and
supply chain.

**Expansion Projects and Investment Program**

To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe in the longterm and to allow us to successfully meet ongoing and expected future market growth and the requirements of our customers
with regard to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to continue to make prudent and controlled investments to
further expand and improve the efficiency of our production facilities as part of our long-term “Two Twentyfive” strategy.
In addition to further capacity expansion, our “Two Twentyfive” strategy, among other things, also contemplates a gradual
technological transition and generation change away from the use of corrugators with a trim width of 2.5m, which are
installed and currently in use at some of our older corrugated board production sites, to the use of more modern corrugators
with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our corrugated board production sites.

With the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up at our third and newest paper machine (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, we became a significant net seller of containerboard again. In the short- to mid-term, we
therefore intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production
capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market opportunities for profitable growth, similar to
those that led to the successful establishment of six new corrugated board plants (PW09, PW10, PW11, PW12, PW13 and
PW14) in Plössberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland), Drizzona (Italy), Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom), Eisfeld
(Germany) and Strykow (Poland) since 2015. We expect that (i) the start of commercial production in January 2023 and
ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated
board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, (ii) the expected start of production in the second quarter of
2024 and subsequent ramp-up at our proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, and (iii)
our further proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy will lead to a further increase in the
corrugated board production of Board, so that we will again be operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor
with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board and again become a net purchaser of containerboard in the
mid-term. With the proposed additional corrugated board plants (PW15 and PW16) in Petersberg, Germany and Drizzona,
Italy, we expect our annual corrugated board production capacity to increase from currently approximately 1,815,000 tons
to approximately 2,215,000 tons.

In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we intend to achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion
opportunities via greenfield projects. However, as with our corrugated board production sites (PW03 in Burg, (PW05) in
Schüttorf, (PW06) in Offenbach a.d. Queich and (PW09) in Plössberg, Germany, our corrugated board production sites
(PW10) in Trzcinica and (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, our production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy and our production
site (PW12 ) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, we are also establishing our proposed new corrugated board production
site (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of
a customer, German packaging specialist G&G Preißer, which allows us to supply this long-standing customer and partner


-----

largely without freight and other freight expenses. Our latest corrugated board project (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy will also
be established in immediate vicinity to an existing packaging customer as a packaging park.

While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including the ten packaging park projects (PW03,
PW05, two packaging park customers at PW06, PW09, PW10, PW11, PW12, PW13 and PW14) and the proposed new
corrugated board production sites (PW15 and PW16) in Germany and Italy, we are also evaluating and will continue to
evaluate opportunities to find partners to leverage the benefits of a packaging park and that would enrich our existing
network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our corrugated board production capacity and meet the
other internal investment and financing criteria described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our
relationships with certain large and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with
significant new customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated
board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers. We currently expect to make
total investments of approximately €246 million into the two proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW15 and
PW16) in Germany and Italy. With an expected combined annual incremental corrugated board production capacity for
PW15 and PW16 of approximately 400,000 tons of corrugated board, an average net selling price per ton of corrugated
board of €756.1 per ton in 2023 and historic EBITDA margins for Board in the high single digit to low double digit range,
we believe PW15 and PW16 to be able to make a sizable contribution to EBITDA following completion of both projects.
Historically, our new corrugated board production sites have typically achieved a capacity utilization level of around 90%
within 3 to 5 years of start of operation.

In the first quarter of 2023, we started construction of a new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) next to PM3 in SandersdorfBrehna, to supply our newest paper machine with the required process steam as well as electricity. We currently expect to
make total investments of approximately €190 million, with a target completion date towards mid-2025.

As part of our long-term planning, we finally seized the opportunity to secure a currently disused, traditional paper site in
Stockstadt near Aschaffenburg, Germany from Sappi. We signed the purchase agreement in September 2023 and expect
the acquisition to close towards the end of April 2024. In October 2023, we made a downpayment, and in May 2024, we
will be required to pay the bulk of the purchase price, the amount of which we have agreed to keep confidential. We believe
that the site offers us a rare option to develop a further potential paper mill project in the future. Our intention is to develop
a further circular economy concept for the site step-by-step so that we can use a closed material loop to manufacture
containerboard in a sustainable and innovative way and thus continue our growth strategy in the long run. Although we do
not currently plan to implement a further paper machine project in the short-term and do not currently expect to commence
production at any such potential further paper mill before the end of the decade, we believe that our limited investment to
secure the new site in Stockstadt demonstrates our advantage of being able to make long-term investment decisions as a
family-owned business.

Even successful expansion (or acquisition) projects can have a negative impact on our profitability in the short-term. For
example, our reduced profitability between 2009 and 2010 following the global financial and economic crisis coincided
with the launch of production at our corrugated board production sites in Strykow, Poland (PW7) and Ellesmere Port,
United Kingdom (PW8) and at our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany (PM2), which involved significant start-up
and ramp-up costs. Similarly, our reduced profitability in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, coincided with
the ramp-up of our corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany and the launch of production and
subsequent ramp-up at our paper mill in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany (PM3), which involved significant start-up and
ramp-up costs. In each case, the related costs were largely expected and are normal in our industry, but their timing put
further pressure on our profitability. In addition, even in a positive market environment, it typically takes two to three years
from the launch of a new corrugated board production site until the production site is fully utilized. For example, we
launched our corrugated board production site in Eisfeld, Germany (PW13) in November 2019, but the site only completed
its ramp-up phase in 2021 and therefore, did not operate at a three-shift capacity for an entire year until 2021. Our newest
corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland commenced commercial production in January 2023 and we
do not expect it to complete its ramp-up phase and to operate at a full, three-shift capacity until sometime in 2025. We
expect our proposed new corrugated board production site (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany and our proposed further
corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy with a combined expected total annual incremental corrugated
board production capacity of 400,000 tons, to also undergo ramp-up phases of different durations with a corresponding
impact on our result of operations. Moreover, the start-up and ramp-up costs and short- to mid-term impact on our
profitability of our latest paper machine project (PM3) will be proportionately higher, due to the much larger size, higher
level of complexity and longer implementation timeframe of such a project, compared to the establishment of a new
corrugated board production site. Even though our newest paper mill in Sandersdorf-Brehna (PM3) commenced operations
in August 2020, it has still not completed its initial ramp-up phase, and we are still continuing our efforts to optimize our
operations at this newest mill, which involves not only the optimization of the performance of PM3, but also the
optimization of connected processes, including the operation of the closed cycle water treatment system at PM3 and the
proposed further waste-to-energy plant that is currently under construction in Sandersdorf-Brehna. For more information

**Continuous Improvement Program**

As described above, we operate in a cyclical industry where the price of our containerboard and corrugated board as well
as recovered paper, our primary raw material, is subject to cyclical fluctuations. Other major cost items, such as personnel
expenses, are the subject of annual increases, and the costs of energy and freight, which are also significant expenses, have
partly trended upwards. In order to maintain profitability throughout the economic cycle, we have implemented a
comprehensive profitability improvement program (the “Continuous Improvement Program”) to ensure the long-term
success of our Group. Our Continuous Improvement Program focuses on (i) improving the effectiveness of our sales and
marketing activities, (ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and (iii) stabilizing our specific fixed costs in order
to achieve sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost leaders in the recycled containerboard market.

Since 2012, our main focus in connection with our goal of achieving sales excellence has been on (i) growing our external
sales in excess of the general growth in market volumes (and thereby increasing our market share), (ii) maximizing the
impact of the introduction of our “next generation” products into the market, and (iii) optimizing our sales portfolio. As
part of our efforts to optimize our variable costs, we have focused on (i) reducing our consumption of raw materials,
(ii) optimizing our energy consumption and energy costs and (iii) reducing the purchase prices of our key production
factors, such as recovered paper, starch and freight services. Our continued ability to implement these and other efficiency
improvement projects successfully may have a significant impact on our profitability. For more information about our past
and ongoing efforts to ensure the sustainability of our business and to maintain our position as a cost leader, see also “—

Sales primarily include income derived from the sale of corrugated board and external sales of containerboard. We report
sales as sales in Germany and sales abroad (by destination), respectively, based on the country in which our customer is
located. Other sales primarily include freight sales of Logistics, for example, when we hire out trucks from our own fleet
to avoid empty trips or to make use of opportunities in the freight market.

**Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process**

Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process records the increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in
process at manufacturing cost. The manufacturing costs include direct material and labor costs as well as material and
production overheads allocated proportionally on the assumption of normal utilization of production capacity.

**Other own work capitalized**

Other own work capitalized mainly relates to capitalized personnel expenses in connection with our ongoing investment
projects.

**Other operating income**

Other operating income consists of all income from ordinary business activities not already recognized under other income
items. Other operating income includes, among other things, income from investment subsidies, income from other periods,
income from the release of provisions, refunds of energy tax, income from insurance refunds from damage events, income
from reduction of bad debt allowance, and exchange rate gains.

**Cost of materials**

Cost of materials consists of costs of raw materials, consumables and supplies and purchased goods such as recovered
paper, externally purchased containerboard, costs of chemicals, costs for auxiliary materials as well as pallet costs. It also
includes costs of purchased services, including energy (i.e., for electricity, gas and steam), costs of waste disposal and costs
for freight brokerage at Logistics.


-----

**Personnel expenses**

Personnel expenses include all expenses for wages and salaries (including bonuses) and other employment benefits,
contributions to pension plans and social security contributions. Personnel expenses also include the costs of hiring new
personnel and training costs.

**Amortization and depreciation of fixed intangible and tangible assets and exceptional write downs on current assets**

We incur expense for depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible fixed assets as a result
of both scheduled depreciation and impairment losses on these assets. Depreciation and amortization are usually charged
on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the assets.

**Other operating expenses**

Other operating expenses primarily include freight expenses, expenses from exchange rate differences, expenses from other
periods, maintenance and repair expenses, insurance and additional expenses, personnel-related expenses, rental and
leasing expenses, vehicle expenses (excl. rental and leasing expenses), legal and consulting fees and other expenses
(including extraordinary expenses).

**Depreciation on financial assets and of securities held as current assets**

Depreciation on financial assets and of securities held as current assets include impairment losses on financial assets and
marketable securities.

**Interest income/(expenses), net**

Interest income/(expenses), net includes other interest and similar income as well as interest and similar expenses. Interest
and similar expenses primarily include interest expense and other financing costs related to long-term loans, short-term
bank liabilities as well as bank and bank guarantee provisions.

**Taxes**

Taxes comprise trade taxes, corporate taxes, foreign taxes, deferred taxes as well as other taxes, such as taxes on substance
(mainly real estate taxes as well as motor vehicle taxes).

**_Sales_**

Total sales decreased by €439.2 million, or 25.0%, from €1,759.2 million in 2022 to €1,320.0 million in 2023. This decrease
was mainly attributable to lower price levels which negatively impacted our sales in 2023 by €463.7 million and outweighed
a positive contribution of €66.9 million of higher sales volumes compared to 2022. Total corrugated board sales decreased
by €336.0 million, or 22.8%, from €1,472.6 million in 2022 to €1,136.7 million in 2023. Corrugated board sales volumes
increased by approximately 62,000 tons, from approximately 1,432,000 tons in 2022 to approximately 1,494,000 tons in
2023. The increased sales volume was mainly attributable to the ramp-up of our newest corrugated board plant (PW14) in
Strykow, Poland, following the start of commercial production in January 2023, and volume increases in Italy and the
United Kingdom. However, the average price per ton of corrugated board in 2023 was significantly below the average
price of 2022 (-24%). At the same time, our total containerboard sales volume decreased slightly by approximately 5,000
tons, or 0.3%, from approximately 1,568,000 tons in 2022 to approximately 1,563,000 tons in 2023. External sales volume
of containerboard increased by approximately 8,000 tons, or 2%, from approximately 395,000 tons in 2022 to
approximately 403,000 tons in 2023. The average price per ton for externally sold containerboard in 2023 was also
significantly below the average price in 2022 (-39%), which also had a negative impact on our total sales in 2023. See also

In 2023, sales by destination in Germany accounted for 34.4% of total sales compared to 36.7% of total sales in 2022. Sales
by destination in Germany decreased by €191.6 million, or 29.7%, from €645.7 million in 2022 to €454.1 million in 2023,
primarily due to a €144.5 million, or 27.2%, decrease in corrugated board sales primarily due to lower sales prices for
corrugated board products. External sales of containerboard in Germany decreased by €2.7 million, or 5.2%, primarily due
to lower containerboard sales prices. Other sales in Germany decreased by €44.4 million, or 70.4%, primarily as a result
of lower external sales revenue for Power. The background to this was a change in the invoicing of the electricity volumes
generated, which were sold externally by Power in 2022 and sold directly by Power to PM2 internally in 2023 due to
regulatory changes. Sales by destination abroad also decreased by €247.6 million, or 22.2%, from €1,113.5 million in 2022
to €865.9 million in 2023.

Total corrugated board sales decreased by €336.0 million, or 22.8%, in 2023 compared to 2022, due to the €144.5 million
decrease in sales in Germany and €191.4 million decrease in sales abroad. External sales of containerboard decreased
significantly by €59.6 million, or 27.2%, from €219.6 million in 2022 to €159.9 million in 2023, while other sales decreased
by €43.6 million, or 65.1%, from €67.0 million in 2022 to €23.4 million in 2023. Corrugated board sales as a percentage
of total sales further increased from 83.7% in 2022 to 86.1% in 2023, while containerboard sales as a percentage of total
sales further decreased from 12.5% in 2022 to 12.1% in 2023.

**_Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process_**

Primarily due to lower price levels and lower containerboard stocks in 2023, our increase/(decrease) in finished goods and
work in progress decreased by €30.1 million from €10.2 million in 2022 to €(19.9) million in 2023.

**_Other own work capitalized_**

Own work capitalized in 2023 mainly relates to capitalised personnel expenses in connection with our ongoing investments
into the proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW15 and PW16) in Germany and Italy and the proposed new
waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) next to PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, whereas own work capitalized in 2022 mainly
relates to capitalised personnel expenses in connection with our investments into our corrugated board plants (PW14) in
Poland and (PW15) in Germany.

**Other operating income ..........................................................................................** **34,136** **53,084** **55.5**

Other operating income increased by €18.9 million, or 55.5%, from €34.1 million in 2022 to €53.1 million in 2023,
primarily due to higher income from exchange rate differences mainly on short-term loans and significantly higher income
from other periods. Income from other periods increased significantly in 2023 due to higher proceeds from electricity price
compensation while income from the reversal of provisions declined. Income from investment subsidies decreased by €8
thousand, or 0.3%, from €2.5 million in 2022 to €2.5 million in 2023 and relates to subsidies we received in connection
with former expansion projects. We recognize these subsidies as other operating income in line with the depreciation of
the relevant assets over a period of up to 33 years. On the other hand, income from other periods increased by €14.2 million,
or 56.0%, from €25.3 million in 2022 to €39.5 million in 2023.

Other income, including extraordinary income, increased by €1.0 million, or 84.8%, from €1.2 million in 2022 to €2.2
million in 2023 mainly due to revaluation of the Existing Notes in the amount of €0.9 million we had repurchased to the
acquisition value.

**Cost of materials ...........................................................................................** **(1,016,645)** **(797,384)** **(21.6)**

Cost of materials decreased by €219.3 million, or 21.6%, from €1,016.6 million in 2022 (57.8% of sales, or 56.2% of Total
Output) to €797.4 million in 2023 (60.4% of sales, or 58.7% of Total Output), mainly as a result of lower costs of raw
materials, consumables and supplies but also due to lower cost of purchased services. Especially, lower recovered paper
costs and lower costs for externally purchased containerboard contributed to this development. The lower prices for
recovered paper and for containerboard more than compensated for the higher consumption due the increase in production
volumes in 2023. Energy costs (i.e., for electricity, gas and steam) decreased from €203.3 million in 2022 to €179.0 million
in 2023 due to lower prices for energy consumption and power network charges.

The cost of raw material, consumables and supplies also decreased by €196.9 million, or 26.0%, from €758.9 million in
2022 to €561.9 million in 2023. The average costs per ton for our recovered paper purchases in 2023 were significantly
lower (-47.5%) compared to 2022. The cost of purchased services also decreased by €22.3 million, or 8.7%, from €257.8
million in 2022 to €235.5 million in 2023, due to lower energy costs. The cost for freight brokerage at Logistics, on the
other hand, increased by €2.9 million, or 9.2%, from €31.3 million in 2022 to €34.1 million in 2023.

The decrease in cost of materials was below the 25.0% decrease in total sales in 2023. See also “—Key Factors Affecting
_our Results of Operations—Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input_
_Costs—Fluctuations in Raw Material Costs” above._

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross Profit decreased by €230.5 million, or 29.1%, from €790.8 million (45.0% of sales, or 43.8% of Total Output) in
2022 to €560.4 million (42.5% of sales, or 41.3% of Total Output) in 2023. This decrease of our Gross Profit is primarily
due to the weak market environment and the resulting price pressure, which caused sales prices to fall more sharply than
could be compensated for by falling raw material and energy costs.

Personnel expenses in 2023 increased by €0.6 million, or 0.5%, from €122.0 million in 2022 to €122.6 million in 2023,
reflecting a €1.3 million, or 1.3%, decrease in wages and salaries and a €1.9 million, or 10.8%, increase in social security
and pensions. The decrease in wages and salaries is related to lower variable remuneration in 2023. Contrary effects came
from (i) a 5.9% increase in the average number of employees (from 1,623 in 2022 to 1,719 in 2023), primarily in connection
with the personnel expansion related to our growth projects and the strengthening of central functions, (ii) one-off payments
to all employees to compensate for high inflation in the first quarter of 2023, and (iii) regular annual salary and wage
increases.

million in 2022 to €49.9 million in 2023.

Legal and consulting fees slightly decreased by €0.2 million or 1.9%, from €9.2 million in 2022 to €9.0 million in 2023.
Expenses from exchange rate differences decreased by €3.5 million, or 62.1%, from €5.7 million in 2022 to €2.2 million
in 2023. Rental and leasing expenses increased by €0.5 million, or 4.3%, from €11.9 million in 2022 to €12.5 million in
2023 primarily due to price increases and the leasing of additional equipment.


-----

Other expenses, including extraordinary expenses, decreased by €18.2 million, or 49.9%, from €36.5 million in 2022 to
€18.3 million in 2023, mainly due to reclassifications in 2022 which led to higher other operating expenses in 2022.
Furthermore, due to increasing other operating expenses, the categories have been expanded and various items have been
reclassified compared to year 2022. This decrease was partly offset by €2.2 million extraordinary expenses related to
financing costs in connection with entry into the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured IKBDZ BANK Facility. Expenses from other periods increased by €1.9 million, from €1.7 million in 2022 to €3.5 million in
2023.

EBITDA ................................................................................................................. 412,026 200,768 (51.3)

Our EBITDA decreased by €211.3 million, or 51.3%, from €412.0 million in 2022 (23.4% of sales) to €200.8 million in
2023 (15.2% of sales), mainly driven by lower sales and gross margins due to the lower sales price level. Primarily because
of the decrease in the average selling prices for our products, which were only partially offset by lower cost of materials
and higher sales volumes, our Contribution Margin in 2023 decreased by €255.0 million compared to 2022. The sum of
personnel expenses plus other operating expenses (excluding freight expenses and extraordinary expenses) plus other taxes
decreased by €25.2 million. The remaining other EBITDA items (as the sum of own work capitalized plus other operating
income (excluding extraordinary income)) increased by €18.6 million. The extraordinary expenses in 2023 relates to
financing costs in connection with the entry into the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured IKBDZ Bank Facility.

**_Sales_**

Total sales increased significantly by €402.2 million, or 29.6%, from €1,357.0 million in 2021 to €1,759.2 million in 2022.
This increase in sales was attributable to a slight decrease in sales volume with a negative impact of €54.4 million,
outweighed by the significantly higher prices for both corrugated board and containerboard products with a positive
contribution of €436.4 million compared to 2021. Corrugated board sales increased by €329.4 million, or 28.8%, in 2022
compared to 2021, significantly in excess of general market growth. Corrugated board sales volumes decreased by
approximately 72,000 tons, from approximately 1,504,000 tons in 2021 to approximately 1,432,000 tons in 2022. The
reduced sales volume was attributable to lower order intakes in most markets mainly as a consequence of the subdued
market environment. Furthermore, the lower order intake led to lower utilization rates of our corrugated board plants.
Additionally, the market environment was more challenging in 2022 than in 2021. Our total containerboard sales volume
decreased slightly by approximately 19,000 tons, or 1.2%, from approximately 1,587,000 tons in 2021 to approximately
1,568,000 tons in 2022. External sales volume of containerboard decreased by approximately 5,000 tons, or 1.3%, from
approximately 400,000 tons in 2021 to approximately 395,000 tons in 2022. In response to weaker internal and external
demand as well as the very high energy spot price levels in 2022 as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we curtailed
production, especially at our newest paper machine PM3 in the third quarter of 2022. As a result, the average level of
integration between Paper and Board, including swap agreements, decreased from 87% in 2021 to 85% in 2022. The
average price per ton for externally sold containerboard in 2022 was significantly above the average price in 2021 (+34%).
While in 2021 price increases for containerboard were mainly driven by strong demand, prices for containerboard continued
to rise steadily in the first half of 2022 due to the strong increases in energy and raw material costs. Increasingly high stocks
of containerboard in the industry and lower raw material costs led to a subsequent drop in prices in the second half of 2022.
At the same time, the average price of corrugated board in 2022 was significantly above the average price of 2021 (+35.0%).
Following the containerboard market, prices for corrugated board rose continuously in the first half of 2022, with necessary
price reductions to limit a decline in sales volume and support sales performance in the second half of 2022. See also “—

(1) The financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021, is taken from the comparative period presented
in the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In 2022, sales by destination in Germany accounted for 36.7% of total sales, compared to 38.4% of total sales in 2021.
Sales by destination in Germany increased by €124.5 million, or 23.9%, from €521.2 million in 2021 to €645.7 million in
2022, primarily due to a €113.1 million or 27.1% increase in corrugated board sales in Germany for the reasons described
above. External sales of containerboard in Germany decreased by €14.5 million or 21.8%, while other sales in Germany
increased by €25.9 million or 69.7%, primarily as a result of sales of electricity produced by our existing waste-to-energy
plant in Eisenhüttenstadt and the high energy prices in 2022. Sales abroad by destination also increased by €277.7 million,
or 33.2%, from €835.8 million in 2021 to €1,113.5 million in 2022, due to the increasing price levels for our products.

**Total sales (audited) ................................................................................................** **1,356,971 1,759,195** **29.6**

Total corrugated board sales increased by €329.4 million or 28.8% in 2022 compared to 2021, due to the €113.1 million
increase in corrugated board sales in Germany and €216.3 million increase in corrugated board sales abroad. External sales
of containerboard increased by €47.6 million or 27.7%, from €171.9 million in 2021 to €219.6 million in 2022, while other
sales increased by €25.2 million or 60.2%, from €41.8 million in 2021 to €67.0 million in 2022 primarily as a result of
sales of electricity produced by our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt and the high energy prices in 2022.
As a result, corrugated board sales as a percentage of total sales decreased slightly from 84.2% in 2021 to 83.7% in 2022,
while containerboard sales as a percentage of total sales decreased from 12.7% in 2021 to 12.5% in 2022

**_Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process_**

Due to the lower sales volumes and production of both Paper and Board in 2022, our increase/(decrease) in finished goods
and work in progress decreased by €22.0 million, from €32.2 million in 2021 to €10.2 million in 2022.

**_Other own work capitalized_**

Due to our capitalized personel expenses in connection with our investments into our corrugated board plants (PW14) in
Poland and (PW15) in Germany, our other own work capitalized increased by €2.1 million, from €1.8 million in 2021 to
€4.0 million in 2022.

  - Unaudited.

Other operating income increased by €7.2 million, or 26.7%, from €27.0 million in 2021 to €34.1 million in 2022. This
was primarily due to higher income from other periods which increased by €11.8 million, or 86.9%, from €13.5 million in
2021 to €25.3 million in 2022. The main reasons for this increase was the reversal of the provisions and income from
electricity price compensation. The significant increase in income from other periods was partly offset by the lower income
from exchange rate differences, which decreased by €4.2 million, or 44.9%, from €9.3 million in 2021 to €5.2 million in
2022.

Income from investment subsidies decreased by €0.5 million, or 15.7%, from €3.0 million in 2021 to €2.5 million in 2022;
whereas other income, including extraordinary income, increased by €0.1 million, or 8.0%, from €1.1 million in 2021 to
€1.2 million in 2022.

**Cost of materials ...........................................................................................** **(825,692)** **(1,016,645)** **23.1**

Cost of materials increased significantly by €191.0 million, or 23.1%, from €825.7 million in 2021 (60.8% of sales, or
58.2% of Total Output) to €1,016.6 million in 2022 (57.8% of sales, or 56.2% of Total Output), mainly as a result of a
significant increase in the cost of purchased services by €102.0 million, or 65.5%, from €155.8 million in 2021 to €257.8
million in 2022. This was driven primarily by significantly higher energy prices in 2022 following the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. Energy costs (i.e., for electricity, gas and steam) amounted to €203.3 million in 2022, compared to €107.5 million
in 2021.

The cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies also increased by €88.9 million, or 13.3%, from €669.9 million in
2021 to €758.9 million in 2022 as a result of higher price levels for containerboard and for recovered paper as well as
higher costs for starch. The average costs per ton for our recovered paper purchases in 2022 were slightly higher (+3.5%)
compared to 2021. The cost of purchased services also increased by €102.0 million, or 65.5%, from €155.8 million in 2021
to €257.8 million in 2022. Costs for freight brokerage at Logistics increased by €4.2 million, or 15.3% from €27.1 million
in 2021 to €31.3 million in 2022.

The increase in cost of materials was below the 29.6% increase in total sales in 2022. See also “—Key Factors Affecting
_our Results of Operations—Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input_
_Costs—Fluctuations in Energy Costs” above._

**_Gross Profit_**

Gross Profit increased by €198.6 million, or 33.5%, from €592.2 million (43.6% of sales, or 41.8% of Total Output) in
2021 to €790.8 million (45.0% of sales, or 43.8% of Total Output) in 2022. This increase of our Gross Profit is primarily
due to the increase in sales price levels, which more than compensated for the higher cost of materials.

Personnel expenses in 2022 increased by €14.1 million, or 13.0%, from €108.0 million in 2021 to €122.0 million in 2022,
reflecting a €12.5 million, or 13.6%, increase in wages and salaries and a €1.6 million, or 9.7%, increase in social security
and pensions. These increases were due to (i) a 11.6% increase in the average number of employees (from 1,454 in 2021
to 1,623 in 2022), primarily related in the hiring of new employees in connection with our new corrugated board plant
(PW14) in Strykow, Poland and an increase in the number of overhead group positions in line with our strong
growth,(ii) regular annual salary and wage increases and (iii) higher variable remuneration.

Net interest expense in 2022 decreased by €6.2 million, or 19.3%, from net expenses of €32.1 million in 2021 to net
expenses of €25.9 million in 2022. This decrease is related to an increase in other interest and similar income by €2.6
million, from €0.1 million in 2021 to €2.7 million in 2022. Interest and similar expenses decreased by €3.6 million, or
11.1%, from €32.2 million in 2021 to €28.6 million in 2022, due to a lower average amount of financial debt, as a result of
the scheduled repayment of bank loans.

**_Depreciation on financial assets and of securities held as current assets_**

Depreciation on financial assets and of securities held as current assets amounted to €0.9 million in 2022 (nil in 2021) due

2022 (23.4% of sales). As a result of the factors described above, following the strong operating performance driven by
higher price levels, our Contribution Margin in 2022 increased by €167.4 million compared to 2021. The sum of personnel
expenses plus other operating expenses (excluding freight expenses and extraordinary expenses) plus other taxes increased
by €38.1 million. The remaining other EBITDA items (as the sum of own work capitalized plus other operating income
(excluding extraordinary income)) increased by €9.5 million.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

**Overview**

Our primary sources of financing are cash generated from our operating activities and external financings, including
drawings under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. As of the date of
this offering memorandum, we have undrawn capacity of €200 million under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement. Our cash requirements consist mainly of debt and tax servicing requirements, the purchase of raw materials,
energy and freight, working capital, personnel expenses and capital expenditures, including in relation to the planned
expansion projects. See “—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment
_Program”._

As of December 31, 2023, we had Total Financial Debt (calculated as bank loans plus bonds, minus other securities, i.e.,
Existing Notes we have repurchased and hold on balance sheet) of €762.6 million compared to €813.9 million as of
December 31, 2022 and €874.9 million as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash-in-hand, bank
balances in the amount of €130.5 million and Net Financial Debt of €632.1 million (calculated as Total Financial Debt less
cash-in-hand, bank balances).

Our ability to generate cash from our operating activities depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn
dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of
which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed under “Risk Factors”. In addition, our ability to draw under
the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will only be available if, among other things, we meet the financial
covenant set out therein. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
_Agreement”._

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, capacity under the Senior Secured Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and cash-in-hand as well as bank balances will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and
debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or
that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due,
including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.


-----

If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources (including borrowings under our current or
any future credit facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be
forced to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

  - sell certain of our assets;

  - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

  - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the Senior Secured Facilities, the Notes and any future debt may limit our ability
to pursue any of these alternatives.

_Cash flow from operating activities_

In 2023, our cash flow from operating activities decreased by €146.1 million from €365.3 million in 2022 to €219.2 million
in 2023. This decrease in our cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to the lower consolidated net
income in 2023 and higher cash outflows for income taxes paid. Contrary effects resulted from a €65.4 million balance
sheet decrease in Trade Working Capital from €268.7 million as at December 31, 2022 to €203.3 million as at December
31, 2023.

In 2022, our cash flow from operating activities increased by €209.4 million from €155.9 million in 2021 to €365.3 million
in 2022. The increase in our cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to our significantly improved
EBITDA as a result of our strong operational performance. Contrary effects resulted from a €49.6 million balance sheet
increase in our Trade Working Capital, from €219.1 million as at December 31, 2021 to €268.7 million as at December 31,
2022, as described in more detail below.


-----

Our cash flow from operating activities is significantly affected by changes in our net working capital. As a result, our cash
flow from operating activities can be significantly affected by changes in raw material prices or an increase or decrease of
sales volumes as well as payment terms, as those factors affect the amount of inventories, trade receivables and trade
payables. The following table sets forth our net working capital as of the dates indicated:

We record a liability under trade payables only if we have received the related supplier invoice by the relevant balance
sheet date and provided that all other prerequisites for the recognition as a liability have been met. We record liabilities
related to goods or services we have received during the relevant period, but for which we have not yet received an invoice,
under other provisions on our balance sheet. These provisions for outstanding invoices amounted to €46.7 million, €62.7
million and €62.1 million as of December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

In 2023, our Trade Working Capital decreased by €65.4 million, or 24.3%, from €268.7 million as of December 31, 2022
to €203.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in our Trade Working Capital is attributable to (i) a significant
decrease in our trade receivables, (ii) a decrease in our inventories and (iii) an increase in our trade payables. Trade
receivables decreased by €44.0 million, or 24.9%, from €177.1 million as of December 31, 2022 to €133.1 million as of
December, 2023, mainly due to lower sales based on lower sales prices in December 2023. The decrease of €10.8 million,
or 6.0%, in inventories from €181.4 million as of December 31, 2022 to €170.6 million as of December 31, 2023 was
mainly driven by a decrease of the price levels for containerboard and corrugated board in 2023 and therefore a lower
valuation of our work in progress as well as a lower stock of containerboard. This decrease was partly compensated for by
higher raw materials, consumables and supplies as a result of a higher number of spare parts. At the same time, the amount
of trade payables increased by €10.5 million, or 11.7%, from €89.8 million as of December 31, 2022 to €100.3 million as
of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily related to our ongoing expansion projects and year end effects.

In 2022, our Trade Working Capital increased significantly by €49.6 million, or 22.7%, from €219.1 million as of
December 31, 2021 to €268.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in our Trade Working Capital is attributable
to (i) an increase in our trade receivables, (ii) an significant increase in our inventories and (iii) a decrease in our trade
payables. Trade receivables increased by €9.6 million, or 5.7%, from €167.5 million as of December 31, 2021 to €177.1
million as of December 31, 2022 mainly due to higher sales and year-end effects as at December 31, 2021. The significant
increase of €18.8 million, or 11.5%, in inventories from €162.6 million as of December 31, 2021 to €181.4 million as of
December 31, 2022 was mainly driven by an increase of the price levels for containerboard and corrugated board in 2022
and therefore a higher valuation of our finished goods. Furthermore, raw materials, consumables and supplies increased as
a result of a higher number of spare parts. At the same time, the amount of trade payables decreased by €21.3 million, or
19.2%, from €111.1 million as of December 31, 2021 to €89.8 million as of December 31, 2022 mainly due to lower price
levels for purchased raw materials, especially recovered paper, as well as year-end effects.

_Cash flow from investing activities_

Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of cash outflows for investments in tangible and intangible fixed
assets as well as cash inflows from the disposal of fixed assets as well as interest received concerning financial assets and
cash in hand.

In 2023, our cash outflow from investing activities increased slightly by €3.9 million, or 2.3%, from €165.1 million in 2022
to €169.0 million in 2023. These cash outflows were mainly attributable to investments in our corrugated board plant
projects in Strykow, Poland (PW14), Petersberg, Germany (PW15) and Cessalto, Italy (PW16) and in the further waste-toenergy plant (PPO2) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. In addition to these major projects, several medium-sized and
smaller investments in different plants were also included as part of our Capital Expenditures, as they are expected to lead
to an improvement in our operating performance.


-----

In 2022, our cash outflows from investing activities significantly increased by €53.0 million, or 47.3%, from €112.1 million
in 2021 to €165.1 million in 2022. These cash outflows were mainly attributable to investments in our corrugated board
plant projects in Strykow, Poland (PW14), Petersberg, Germany (PW15) and Cessalto, Italy (PW16) and in the proposed
further waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. In addition to these major projects, several
medium-sized and smaller investments in different plants were also included as part of our Capital Expenditures, as they
are expected to lead to an improvement in our operating performance. Cash outflows from investing activities in 2022
further included €28.4 million in outflows payments to acquire financial assets as part of financial short-term planning
related to open market purchases of the Existing Notes.

We primarily finance our Capital Expenditures with cash flow from operating activities. From time to time, we have also
financed our major Capital Expenditures projects through borrowings. The following table sets forth our Capital
Expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023:

**Year ended December 31,**
**2021** **2022** **2023**

Additions to intangible fixed assets ....................................... 11,139 5,729 391

As discussed in more detail under “Business—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost
_corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled investments” and “—Key Factors Affecting our Results of_
_Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program” above, our strategy involves significant additional investments_
to further expand both our corrugated board and containerboard production capacities.

In 2023, Capital Expenditures increased significantly by €54.8 million, or 42.2%, from €129.8 million in 2022 to €184.6
million in 2023. Capital Expenditures in 2023 primarily related to €8.3 million, €52.5 million, €17.0 million, €63.5 million
and €7.7 million, respectively, of investments related to our corrugated board plant projects in Strykow, Poland (PW14),
Petersberg, Germany (PW15) and Cessalto, Italy (PW16) and related to the further waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany as well as the acquisition of the traditional paper site Stockstadt we acquired in 2023 from
Sappi. In addition to these major projects, capital expenditure includes a large number of medium-sized and smaller projects
and asset additions that also lead to an improvement in the our operating performance. We therefore see our entire capital
expenditure of 2023 as an investment in the growth and improvement of our business. To differentiate this, pure
maintenance measures are recognized under maintenance and repair expenses in the income statement in accordance with
German GAAP.

In 2022, Capital Expenditures increased by €10.7 million, or 9.0%, from €119.1 million in 2021 to €129.8 million in 2022.
Capital Expenditures of €129.8 million in 2022 primarily related to investments in our corrugated board plant projects in
Strykow, Poland (PW14), Petersberg, Germany (PW15) and Cessalto, Italy (PW16) and related to the proposed further
waste-to-energy plant in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. In addition to these major projects, capital expenditure includes a
large number of medium-sized and smaller projects and asset additions that also lead to an improvement in our operating
performance. We therefore see our entire capital expenditure of 2022 as an investment in the growth and improvement of
our business. To differentiate this, pure maintenance measures are recognized under maintenance and repair expenses in
the income statement in accordance with German GAAP.

Capital Expenditures of €119.1 million in 2021 primarily related to investments in our corrugated board plant projects in
Strykow, Poland (PW14), Petersberg, Germany (PW15), Vimercate, Italy and our paper machine project in SandersdorfBrehna (PM3) as well as related to the proposed further waste-to-energy plant in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. In addition
to these major projects, capital expenditure includes a large number of medium-sized and smaller projects and asset
additions that also lead to an improvement in our operating performance. We therefore see our entire capital expenditure
of 2021 as an investment in the growth and improvement of our business. To differentiate this, pure maintenance measures
are recognized under maintenance and repair expenses in the income statement in accordance with German GAAP.

_Free Cash Flow_

We define Free Cash Flow as cash flow from operating activities less cash outflows from investing activities. Free Cash
Flow comprises the cash surplus or deficit after expenditure on investments and taxes but before net cash used in/provided
by financing activities, and before taking into account cash proceeds and payments relating to shareholders’ equity and


-----

financial liabilities. The reasons for changes in the Free Cash Flow are therefore the same as explained above. In 2023, our
Free Cash Flow decreased by €150.0 million, from a cash inflow of €200.2 million in 2022 to a cash inflow of €50.2 million
in 2023. In 2022, our Free Cash Flow increased significantly by €156.4 million, from a cash inflow of €43.8 million in
2021 to a cash inflow of €200.2 million in 2022.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

In 2023, we reported a cash outflow from financing activities of €82.3 million, mainly related to (i) a voluntary prepayment
of borrowings in an amount of GBP 70.0 million under a former facilities agreement in 2023, (ii) €31.3 million of scheduled
repayments under certain Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, (iii) €24.9 million of interest payments, which related to
interest paid on the Existing Notes and under our credit facilities, (iv) a €5.0 million dividend payment to our shareholders
and (v) proceeds of bonds and borrowing of €60.0 million from the full drawing under the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK
Facility Agreement.

In 2022, we reported a cash outflow from financing activities of €135.1 million, mainly as a result of (i) a €29.3 million
repayment of bonds and borrowings, which related to scheduled repayments under certain Senior Secured Facilities, (ii)
€25.7 million of interest paid, which related to interest paid on the Existing Notes and under our credit facilities, and (iii)
the payment of €80.1 million of dividends to our shareholders.

In 2021, we reported a cash outflow from financing activities of €75.1 million. This amount includes cash inflows related
to (i) proceeds from the issuance of bonds and borrowings of €55.0 million, including €30.0 million of bank loans to fund
the establishment of our newest corrugated board plant PW 14 in Strykow, Poland and €25.0 million in loans we
temporarily borrowed (and have since repaid), out of an abundance of caution, under a €100 million syndicated working
capital facility refinanced by KfW pursuant to its special COVID-19 program, as well as (ii) proceeds from grants
amounting to €16.6 million in connection with our newest paper machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. These
cash inflows were more than off-set by cash outflows related to (i) €117.4 million in cash repayments of bonds and
borrowings, related to scheduled repayments of PLN 63.4 million and €22.5 million, respectively, of borrowings under
former Polish zloty facilities with Commerzbank and under certain of our euro-denominated facilities, €30.0 million in
voluntary prepayments of borrowings we originally incurrent in relation to the financing of our paper machine PM3, and
€50.0 million in voluntary prepayments of borrowings under the €100.0 million KfW working capital facility we entered
into pursuant to KfW’s special COVID-19 program. Cashflows from financing activities in 2021 further included €29.4
million of interest paid in relation to the Existing Notes as well as bank borrowings. We did not pay any dividends in 2021.

**Liquidity management**

While we intend to primarily meet our liquidity requirements with cash-in-hand and bank balances as well as cash generated
from our operating activities, we expect to have sufficient capacity available under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement to be able to meet any additional operating requirements. As of the date of this offering memorandum,
we have undrawn capacity of €200.0 million under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

To manage our liquidity, we maintain a largely centralized cash management system, which includes all our subsidiaries.
In particular, liquidity plans are prepared with the Group budget on a monthly rolling period for the upcoming 12 months
in which the expected cash receipts and payments for the specified time period are set off against each other.

**OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS**

The following discussion describes our material off-balance sheet arrangements.

**Forfaiting Program**

Our subsidiary Progroup Board GmbH finances a portion of its trade receivables through an off balance sheet forfaiting
program with CommerzFactoring GmbH. Under the forfaiting program it sells trade receivables to CommerzFactoring
GmbH on a non recourse basis in return for immediate cash payments. The forfaiting transactions occur up to a maximum
aggregate transaction volume of €30 million. As of December 31, 2023, no trade receivables were sold under the forfaiting
program.

**CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS**

**Financing Arrangements**

As of December 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis to give effect to the Offering and the intended use of proceeds therefrom
as described under “Use of Proceeds”, namely the proposed redemption of the Existing Notes, the third party financing
arrangements of the Group would have been as follows:

**Other Contractual Obligations**

In addition, we have other contractual obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, such as power supply
agreements, maintenance agreements and agreements for the provision of other services. As of December 31, 2023, the
minimum amount of undiscounted future payments under operating leases and for other financial obligations (total payment
obligations) were as follows:

**As of December 31, 2023**

Operating leases ......................................................................................................... 23,650
Other financial obligations ......................................................................................... 338,004
**Total payment obligations .......................................................................................** 361,654

We lease forklifts and trucks pursuant to operating leases that are not recorded on our balance sheet. These operating leases
typically have a term of between three and six years, and the total remaining payment obligations under those leases
amounted to €14.6 million as of December 31, 2023. In addition, we have entered into leasing agreements for other property
as well as for commercial real estate. The total remaining lease payments under those leasing agreements amounted to €9.0
million as of December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2023, we also had contractual off-take obligations under recovered paper and containerboard supply
agreements, which amount to €23.7 million for the remainder of 2024. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, our contractual
obligations under energy supply agreements amounted to €66.8 million for the remainder of 2024. Furthermore, as of
December 31, 2023, we had commitments under open purchase orders amounting to €247.5 million.

**QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**

We are exposed to a number of different market risks arising from our normal business activities.

Based on our assets, liabilities and pending and planned transactions, we are particularly exposed to risks arising from
changes in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as credit risks, such as the risk of default by
counterparties. Furthermore, solvency must be assured at all times (liquidity risk). The objective of risk management is to
use appropriate measures to control these risks where they affect our cash flows. Derivative financial instruments are used
only for hedging purposes. They are not used for trading or speculative purposes. Exchange effects resulting from the
translation of financial statements in foreign currencies into our reporting currency are not hedged. The guidelines for risk
hedging and their implementation are defined and continuously monitored by our Group Treasury Management
department.


-----

**Raw material price risks**

Raw material price risks result primarily from increases in the prices of recovered paper and containerboard, which cannot
fully be passed on to customers through higher sales prices or can only passed on to customers with a time lag of two to
three months.

**Energy price risks**

Energy price risks result primarily from fluctuations in global energy prices and regulatory risks in Germany and other
markets in which we operate.

**Currency risk**

The foreign currency risk is due to the increasing internationalization of the Group and is an additional risk that has
increasing relevance as a result of the increased volatility in global interest rate and currency markets relevance. We
primarily generate our sales in euro. In our foreign subsidiaries where the euro is not the local currency, there is a currency
risk as these subsidiaries generate their sales mainly in local currencies but their material costs are mainly measured in
euro. Currency risk also arises on trade receivables and payables in foreign currencies. Furthermore, there are currency
risks due to the euro-financing of foreign subsidiaries. Throughout the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, there were currency
risks mainly in the British pound, Polish zloty and Czech koruna relative to the euro.

**Interest rate risk**

Currently, interest rate risks arise mainly on interest-bearing liabilities that are denominated in euro.

We expect that our exposure to interest rate fluctuations will relate primarily to the potential drawings under our
€200 million Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and our drawings under the €30 million Senior Secured Erste
Group Bank Facility. From time to time, we will evaluate the necessity of future interest rate hedging.

**Credit risks**

Credit risks arise mainly on trade receivables, bank balances and derivative financial instruments. In view of our relatively
diversified customer list, which extends over various regions, the impact arising from credit risk on trade receivables is
limited. Further, the trade receivables of some of our subsidiaries are credit insured up to the limit the credit insurer
approves.

To minimize the credit risks from the operational business activity, transactions with customers are only entered into after
an internal credit check and a credit approval process. Based on the internal credit check, a limit for a maximum credit risk
per customer is established.

**SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, assumptions and estimates have been made which affect the amounts
and presentation of the assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position, income and expenses, and
contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that may require a
material adjustment to the carrying amount of our assets and liabilities in future periods.

By “significant”, we mean that the following accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results and require management’s subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate the effects
of matters that are inherently uncertain. We discuss the impact and risks associated with these significant accounting
policies on our business operations throughout this discussion and analysis where such policies affect our reported and
expected financial results. You should note that the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period.

All assumptions and estimates are made according to the best of management’s knowledge and belief in order to present a
true and fair view of our net assets, financial position and results of operations. Since the actual values may, in individual
cases, differ from the assumptions and estimates that were made, these are continuously reviewed. Adjustments to the
estimates that are relevant for the financial statements are made in the period in which the change occurs, provided that the
change relates only to this period. If the change relates not only to the reporting period but also to subsequent periods, the
change is taken into account both in the period of the change and in the subsequent periods.


-----

**Tangible Fixed Assets**

Tangible fixed assets are measured at acquisition or production cost less depreciation. The acquisition costs comprise
expenses incurred to acquire an asset and to bring it to its working condition to the extent that such costs can be allocated
individually to such asset. Production cost comprises, if applicable, direct material costs, direct labour costs and special
costs of production, appropriate indirect material costs and indirect labour costs, general and administrative costs and
expenses for social amenities, for voluntary social benefits and for occupational pensions. Borrowing costs have also been
included in production cost to the extent that they were attributable to the period of production. Depreciation is calculated
on a straight-line basis over the standard useful lives. To the extent that the fair values of individual assets fall below their
carrying amounts, additional impairment losses are recorded in case of an expected permanent impairment.

**Investment Grants**

Investment grants (Investitionszuschüsse) are separately recorded as special reserve at their nominal amount on our balance
sheet under “Investment Grants for Fixed Assets” and reversed on a pro rata basis in accordance with useful life of the
fixed asset being subsidized. Investment bonuses (Investitionszulagen) have been recorded in our income statement as other
operating income at the time they are earned.

**Emission Allowances**

The German government has granted us a certain number of free emission allowances. These were acquired free of charge
as part of public allocation. We have recognized these emission allowances at their nominal amount (zero) rather than at
their fair market value, which German GAAP would have allowed us to do. The fair value of the allowances recognized at
a carrying amount of zero amounted to €74.2 million as of December 31, 2021, €72.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and
€92.6 million as of December 31, 2023.

**Valuation of Inventories**

Inventories are measured at the time of acquisition and at the end of each financial year. At the time of acquisition,
inventories are to be valued at acquisition or production cost. Subsequent measurement takes place at the end of each
financial year where inventories are measured at cost, taking account of the lower of cost or market value. Appropriate
valuation allowances are recorded for any identifiable risks resulting from above-average storage periods, reduced
recoverability and/or lower replacement costs. In all cases, fair value measurement was applied, i. e. write-downs are
recognized to the extent that the expected selling prices less costs incurred prior to disposal result in a lower fair value.
Raw materials, consumables and supplies are measured at actual cost or, taking into account the principle of lower of cost
or market value, at lower market values as of the relevant reporting date. Replacement parts for machines are also
recognized under raw materials, consumables and supplies. Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to inventories
which are obsolete, second-hand, damaged or slow moving (€8.4 million in 2021, €11.0 million in 2022 and €11.0 million
in 2023 were applied to replacement parts). Goods-in-progress and finished goods are measured at production cost.
Production cost comprises, if applicable, direct material costs, direct labour costs and special costs of production,
appropriate and necessary indirect material costs, indirect labour costs, depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets that
is attributable to the production process and general and administrative costs and costs of occupational pensions. Borrowing
costs are not included in production cost.

**Receivables and Other Assets**

Receivables and other assets are recognized at their nominal value or at their lower fair value as of the balance sheet date.
Appropriate valuation allowances are provided for receivables whose recoverability is associated with identifiable risks;
irrecoverable receivables are written off in full. To cover the general default and credit risk, a global valuation allowance
of 1% is recognized on domestic and foreign receivables (net of value added tax) which are not subject to a specific
valuation allowance.

**Pension provisions**

Pension provisions for entitlements and current pension obligations are calculated using the Projected Unit Credit (PUC)
Method. They are calculated pursuant to section 253, paragraph 1, clause 2, section 253, paragraph 2 and section 246,
paragraph 2 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). Actuarial opinions have been furnished.
Calculations are based on the “Guide tables 2018 G” of Dr. Klaus Heubeck and an interest rate of 1.82% in 2023 (2022:
1.78%, 2021: 1.90%, in each case based on the “Guide tables 2018 G”).
In accordance with Accounting Practice Statement IDW RH FAB 1.021, direct pension commitments and reinsurance
policies entered into to finance pension claims have to be recorded using matching measurement balances. The rules
provided for a comparison of expected cash flows from the direct pension commitment and the related reinsurance policies.
Accordingly, so-called “matching components” of the obligation and the reinsurance cover are recognized, in principle, at


-----

identical amounts on both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet. The rules are required to be applied for annual
financial statements for periods ended on or after December 31, 2022. If the amount of the liability item is used as the
measurement basis for the matching component, recognition is based on the required settlement amount in accordance with
section 253 of the HGB. Anticipated salary increases are reflected at a rate of 0% for 2023, 2022 and 2021. Pension
increases is reflected at a rate of 2.0%, 2.0% and 2.0%, respectively, for 2021, 2022 and 2023. A fluctuation rate of 0%
was used.

As of December 31, 2023, pension obligations in Germany for which provision were required to be recognized amounted
to €1,542 million. A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan asset. After offsetting the fair value
of the plan asset with the present value of the defined benefit obligation the unfunded defined benefit obligation has been
disclosed as pension provision (€56 thousand in 2022 and €55 thousand in 2023).

In addition, as at December 31, 2023, there are pension obligations within Progroup Board S.A.S, Douvrin, in the amount
of around €0.2 million (€0.2 million in 2022).

**Tax and Other Provisions**

Tax and other provisions are recognized for all identifiable risks and uncertain liabilities at settlement amount. They are
recorded at an amount in line with a reasonable business assessment. All risks arising up to the balance sheet date and
identifiable up to the date of preparation of the financial statements have been taken into account. Provisions with a
remaining term in excess of one year are discounted at the average market interest rate for the last seven financial years as
published by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) corresponding to their remaining maturity.

In order to calculate deferred taxes due to the temporary differences between accounting for assets and liabilities for
commercial law purposes and for tax purposes or due to tax loss carry-forwards, the amounts of the resulting tax charges
or reductions are measured using the tax rates of the individual companies over the time that the differences are phased out
and not discounted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other and are carried in the balance sheet at
their nominal amounts.

Deferred tax assets on tax losses carried forward were recognized to the extent that the underlying tax planning confirmed
that the amounts recognized could be utilized to reduce tax liabilities in the next five years.

**SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GERMAN GAAP AND IFRS**

Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum have been prepared on the basis of
German GAAP, which differ in certain respects from IFRS. The following paragraphs summarize certain significant
differences between German GAAP and IFRS as of December 31, 2023.

The organizations that promulgate IFRS have ongoing projects that could have a significant impact on future comparisons
of German GAAP and IFRS. This description is not intended to provide a comprehensive listing of all such differences
specifically related to us or the industry in which we operate. IFRS are generally more restrictive and more comprehensive
than German GAAP regarding recognition and measurement of transactions, account classification and presentation and
disclosure requirements. We have not attempted to identify all disclosure, presentation or classification differences that
would affect the manner in which transactions and events are presented in the consolidated financial statements or the notes
thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

We have not prepared audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, we cannot assure
you that the differences described below would, in fact, be the accounting principles creating the greatest material
differences between our consolidated financial statements prepared under German GAAP and under IFRS. In addition, we
cannot estimate the net effect that applying IFRS would have on our results of operations or our financial position, or any
part of them, in any of the presentations of financial information in this offering memorandum. The effect of such
differences may be material and, in particular, it may be that the total shareholders’ equity (capital deficit) and net income
prepared on the basis of IFRS would be materially different due to these differences.

**Financial Statement Presentation**

Under IFRS, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on a current/non-current distinction of assets and liabilities.
IFRS requires the presentation of assets and liabilities in order of liquidity only when a liquidity presentation provides
information that is reliable and is more relevant than a current/ non-current presentation. Under German GAAP, the
presentation of the balance sheet is based on the liquidity of the assets and liabilities. This results, for example, in the
different presentation of financial assets and liabilities and deferred taxes in the statement of financial position under IFRS
and German GAAP.


-----

Unlike IFRS, German GAAP does not require the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income and it is very
common (but not required) that the income statement under the German GAAP will be prepared using the “nature of
expense” method and not the “cost of sales” method, which is generally used in the IFRS financial statements. In addition,
the disclosures required in the explanatory notes to the financial statements are far more extensive under IFRS than under
German GAAP.

**Consolidation Principles**

Under IFRS, capital consolidation has to follow the acquisition method, with identifiable assets and liabilities being
measured at their acquisition-date fair values.

Under German GAAP, capital consolidation was required to be reported using the carrying amount method until 2009.
From 2010, the acquisition method and valuation by acquisition date fair values was introduced into German GAAP.

Under IFRS, an entity (investor) is required to consolidate another entity (investee), depending on whether it controls the
investee. An investor controls an investee when it has power over an investee, is exposed, or has rights to the variable
returns from its involvement and due to his power can influence the amount of these variable returns. The consolidation
conclusions under IFRS will not differ significantly from the German GAAP regulations for the most straightforward
entities. However, some differences may arise where there are complex group structures or where specific entities have
been established. Investors that are most likely affected have their involvements, for example, in the following entities:

  - Entities with a dominant investor without a majority of the voting or similar rights and where the rest of voting
rights belongs to the widely-dispersed shareholders (de-facto control);

  - Structured entities (formerly “special purpose entities”) where voting or similar rights are not the dominant means
to determine the power.

Under German GAAP, an investor is required to consolidate the investee if an investor holds the majority of voting rights,
enjoys the right to appoint or dismiss the majority of the management and supervisory board members, enjoys the right to
exercise a controlling influence on financial and operating policies or in substance obtains the majority of risks and rewards
of an investee that has a narrow, well-defined purpose (“special purpose entity”).

**Business Combination**

Under IFRS 3, acquisition related cost (transaction cost) that incurs to affect a business combination are accounted as
expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.

Acquisition-related costs are not part of the consideration transferred to the seller in return for the business; they are not
part of the fair value of the acquired business; they do not represent an asset of the acquirer. Acquisition-related costs
represent services that have been rendered to and consumed by the acquirer. As such, IFRS 3 states that they are accounted
for as an expense when the acquirer consumes the related service.

Under German GAAP certain cost which have been incurred after the decision to acquire an entity qualify for capitalization
and form part of the acquisition cost (e.g. due diligence cost, consultancy cost for valuation reports). All expenses incurred
prior to the decision making have to be expensed as incurred.

Costs related to the issuance of financial liabilities are expensed as incurred. Optionally, interest-like expenses are
capitalized and amortized over the term of the debt.

For purchase price allocation all identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries are reflected at
their fair value regardless of the level of minority share. Under IFRS 3, goodwill acquired in a business combination, must
be allocated to a cash generating unit (CGU) or group(s) of CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that
generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Under German
GAAP goodwill is allocated to the respective business unit to which it refers.

Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and if there is an indication that goodwill may
be impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGU is compared with its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is defined as the higher
of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is less than
its carrying amount, an entity should reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The reduction is an impairment
loss. For assets carried on the depreciated historical cost basis the impairment loss should be recognized in profit or loss
immediately. For assets that are carried at revalued amounts an impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. The


-----

loss is first set against any revaluation surplus relating to the asset in other comprehensive income to the extent of the
surplus and the remaining balance of the loss (if any) is then treated as an expense in profit or loss.

German GAAP requires goodwill to be amortized over its economic life. Goodwill should be reviewed for impairment and
its remaining useful life once a year. Goodwill is impaired if its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Under IFRS, the recorded acquisition cost of property, plant and equipment includes appropriate dismantling, removal and
restoration costs. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying
asset as part of the cost of that asset are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. Overhead costs, such as general and
administrative costs and expenses for social services, voluntary social benefits and company pensions are not part of the
production cost. Under IFRS, individual items within property, plant and equipment are frequently composed of different
component parts with varying useful lives or consumption patterns. These parts are individually replaced during the useful
life of an asset. Under IFRS, each such part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in
relation to the total cost of the item is recognized and depreciated separately (component approach). Costs of required and
regular major inspections are capitalized and depreciated if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the
item will flow to the reporting entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. After initial recognition IFRS further
offers an option to value items of property, plant and equipment at either the (lower) cost of the item less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment or at its fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
impairment.

Under German GAAP, property, plant and equipment is initially valued at acquisition or production cost and includes
general and administrative costs and expenses for social services, voluntary social benefits and company pensions.
Capitalization of costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset is permitted,
but not required (alternative treatment). The component approach is not specifically contemplated by German GAAP rules,
but its use for balance sheet purposes is generally permitted. Costs of regular major inspections are recognized in the
income statement as incurred. A revaluation model is not permitted. Costs of demolishing or restoring an item of property,
plant and equipment do not qualify for capitalization but are required to be reported as provision over the item’s useful life.
After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are accounted for at cost less any accumulated depreciation.

**Government Grants**

Under IFRS, government grants related to a particular asset are recorded on the balance sheet either as deferred income or
by deducting the grant in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset.

Under German GAAP, government grants related to a particular asset are recorded on the balance sheet either as deferred
income or by deducting the grant in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset. Alternatively, a grant may be recorded as
other income in the income statement on the grant date.

**Business Start-up and Expansion Expenses**

Under German GAAP, expenses for the start-up and expansion of a business, if incurred prior to the end of 2009, were
permitted to be capitalized and amortized over a period of four years in accordance with section 269 of the German
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). In the subsequent periods, a similar to IFRS accounting approach for
recognition of the business start-up and expansion expenses is applied.

Under IFRS, expenses for start-up and expansion of a business do not qualify for capitalization and have to be expensed in
the income statement at the time of incurrence.

**Impairment of Assets**

Under IFRS, an impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount. An
asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less cost of disposal and its value
in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.

Under German GAAP, an impairment loss for non-current assets must only be recorded if a permanent impairment in value
is anticipated. The concept of cash generating units is not applicable under German GAAP, and the impairment loss is
determined on an item-by-item basis. An impairment loss is to be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds
its fair value.


-----

**Inventories**

Under IFRS, inventories are carried at lower of cost and net realisable value. Reversal is required for subsequent increase
in value of previous write-downs. Materials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written
down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost.
German GAAP requires inventories to be initially measured at acquisition or production cost. Subsequently, inventories
are measured at (strict) lower of cost of market value (replacement costs or net realisable value only depending on
circumstances).

**Provisions, Other Liabilities and Contingencies**

Some provisions in the financial statements under German GAAP will be required to be reported as other liabilities in
accordance with IFRS. Under IFRS, provisions are recognized if an enterprise has a present obligation as a result of a past
event, it is probable (i.e., more likely than not to occur) that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. In cases where the outflow of economic resources is
expected to occur, an obligation will be reported as a liability. The discount rate used to determine the amount of any
provisions is determined by reference to a pre-tax interest rate for a risk-free obligation that matches the maturity of the
liability to which the provision relates.

Under German GAAP, the criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingencies are less detailed and prescriptive
than under IFRS. Accordingly, there is greater flexibility under German GAAP to record provisions for onerous contracts
and restructuring expenses. In addition, German GAAP estimates are typically made in a more conservative manner. The
recognition of a provision with a probability lower than 50% is possible. German GAAP requires the recording of
provisions for deferred maintenance that is expected to be performed within three months after the end of the reporting
period, uncertain liabilities and expected losses from executory contracts. Long-term provisions (i.e., with a maturity of
more than one year) are discounted using an average market interest rate for the preceding seven years as published by the
German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).

Under IFRS, acquisition costs for property, plant and equipment include the initial estimated costs of dismantling and
removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. The corresponding restructuring provision is required to be
made at its present value. Under German GAAP, restructuring provisions are build up incrementally over the useful life of
the acquired property, plant or equipment at a discounted settlement amount.

**Valuation of Assets and Liabilities; Currency Translation**

Under IFRS, initial recognition and subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities—if qualified as financial
assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss—is required at its fair value. Foreign currency receivables and
liabilities are measured at fair value.

Under German GAAP, current financial assets are required to be recorded at acquisition cost and financial liabilities are
required to be recorded at repayment cost. Current receivables and liabilities in foreign currency are measured at fair value.
The valuation of non-current currency receivables and liabilities with a maturity more than one year has to be in line with
lower of cost or market principle and higher carrying amount at the balance sheet date respectively.

**Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings; Prepaid Expenses**

Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus or minus – in the case of a financial liability not
at fair value through profit or loss – transaction costs. The subsequent measurement depends on the category the financial
liability is assigned to. In the case of the measurement category amortised costs all interest-bearing loans and borrowings
are initially recorded at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial
recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. In
this context, any differences between the disbursement amount (less transaction costs) and the repayment amount are
recognized in profit or loss over the borrowing period.

Under German GAAP, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at their repayment amounts. Transaction costs,
except for costs to be paid to the finance providers, are expensed as incurred. Only equivalent to interest transaction costs
paid to finance providers are deferred as prepaid expenses and amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense.

**Sales, Trade Receivables**

Under German GAAP in effect as of January 1, 2016, the definition of “sales” includes all revenue derived from the regular
business activities of the reporting entity.


-----

Under IFRS, “revenue from certain ancillary business activities is recorded as “other operating income”, rather than “sales”.

For IFRS, the standard (IFRS 15) sets a five-step-model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers 1. Identify
the contract with customer, 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract, 3. Determine the transaction price, 4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, 5. Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance
obligation is satisfied.

Under German GAAP, valuation allowances for losses on individual trade receivables must be recorded. In addition, a
general provision for doubtful accounts—reflecting the general default risk of receivables—has to be recorded. Under IFRS
9, the impairment model is based on providing for expected credit losses which are required to be measured through a loss
allowance at an amount equal to:

  - the twelve-month expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the
financial instrument that are possible within twelve months after the reporting date); or

  - full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life
of the financial instrument).

**Leasing**

Under IFRS, the lessee capitalizes a right of use asset and contrary a liability.

The right-of-use asset is a lessee's right to use an asset over the life of a lease. The asset is calculated as the initial amount
of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made to the lessor before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct
costs incurred, minus any lease incentives received.

The amortization period for the right-of-use asset is from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the lease
term or the end of the useful life of the asset. An exception is when it is reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise an
option to purchase the asset, in which case the amortization period is through the end of the asset’s useful life.

If a right-of-use asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment is immediately recorded, thereby reducing the carrying
amount of the asset. Its subsequent measurement is calculated as the carrying amount immediately after the impairment
transaction, minus any subsequent accumulated amortization.

At the termination of a lease, the right-of-use asset and associated lease liability are removed from the books of the lessee.
The difference between the two amounts is accounted for as a profit or loss at that time. In the case of a low value lease
and a short term lease the lessee can opt for recording a lease expense instead which is similar to the treatment of operating
leases according to German GAAP. Under German GAAP, accounting for leases is mainly driven by tax regulations, so
the lease contracts in Germany typically consider such rules in order to avoid capitalization at the lessee level. These rules
differ from the IFRS rules in several respects.

**Provisions for Pensions**

Under IFRS, provisions for defined benefit pension obligations are accounted for under the projected unit credit method.
The defined benefit obligation is measured using various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions as to future
compensation and benefits levels. Under IFRS, the discount rate reflects the long-term view of the plan and not current
rates that could be used to settle the pension obligation. This discount rate is derived at the reporting date based on then
current capital market conditions. Under one of the options provided by IFRS, remeasurement gains and losses that result
from changes in actuarial assumptions (including changes in mortality tables) or actual experience that differs from the
underlying assumptions do not require recognition of gains and losses as components of net pension cost of the period in
which they arise. Rather they are recognized in other comprehensive income, which will never be reclassified in profit or
loss in the future.

Pension reserves under German GAAP are also be accounted for under the projected unit credit method since the enactment
of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act in 2009. Under German GAAP, the discount rate used represents a tenyear average of market derived interest rates (until 2015: seven-year average market derived interest rate). In addition,
German GAAP requires recognition of the remeasurement gain or losses in profit and loss and not as other comprehensive
income as required under IFRS.


-----

**Deferred Taxes**

Deferred tax assets (DTA) and deferred tax liabilities (DTL) are the income taxes recoverable or payable in future years.
They are mainly based on the taxable or deductible temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or
liability and the respective tax base. Due to the IFRS accounting principles, the carrying amount of an asset or liability can
differ from the amount under German GAAP. Accordingly the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities change as well.

Under German GAAP, net DTL must be recognized in full, while the recognition of net DTA is optional. Unlike German
GAAP, IFRS does not provide an option to capitalize net DTA and, therefore, both net DTA and net DTL have to be
recognized in the respective period.

Under IFRS, DTA shall also be recognized for tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available. Under German GAAP, the capitalization of DTA for loss carryforward shall only be taken into
consideration if the tax benefit from the tax loss carryforward can be expected to be recovered within the next five years.

**Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging**

Under IFRS, derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value (marked-tomarket). Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to the income statement,
except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified
to profit or loss for the period when the forecast transaction being hedged occurs. Under IFRS, the criteria to be met to
qualify for hedge accounting are quite strict. This includes stringent documentation requirements.

Under German GAAP, there is more flexibility to include forecast transactions in hedge accounting. Further, there is no
need to separately account for fair values of derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting (net hedge
presentation method).

**INTRODUCTION**

Containerboard is one of the main materials used to manufacture corrugated board and, ultimately, corrugated containers.
Containerboard is classified according to the type of raw materials from which it is made (virgin fibers or recycled fibers),
whether it is surface treated and whether it is enhanced by coating.

Two types of containerboard can be produced. Containerboard made from virgin fibers (wood pulp) is known as
“kraftliner” and, depending on the type of application, it is better suited for manufacturing corrugated board and containers
intended for some applications in the retail and consumer packaging markets, owing to its greater strength, especially its
high bursting strength, moisture resistance and purity. Containerboard made from recycled fibers (recovered paper, the
primary source of which is old corrugated containers and mixed recovered paper), is known as “testliner” and fluting and
is better suited for transportation and industrial packaging, due to its higher stiffness, lower weight and cheaper price.

Containerboard is classified as kraftliner as long as it mainly contains virgin fibers. Several distinct types of containerboard
products are available in the market, resulting from different formulations of virgin and recycled fibers. This broad offering
of containerboard products serves to address a wide range of potential packaging applications.

Both kraftliner and testliner can be surface-treated to improve printing quality through the use of white, mottled or fully
bleached pulp as the top layer (white-top liner). The board can also be coated, which makes it more resistant to dirt and
moisture, and allows high-gloss printing. This further enhances product appearance and suitability for retail and consumer
packaging.

Virtually all containerboard becomes corrugated board, in the form of linerboard and fluting. Linerboard is used for the
inner and outer layers of the corrugated board and fluting for the middle section. Corrugated board producers select
containerboard grades, specifications and suppliers based on availability, suitability for their own corrugators and
converting machines as well as on brand owners’ performance requirements. The retail industry, through its own specific
requirements, has also been one of the key drivers for containerboard and corrugated board technology and product
development.

For corrugated box and sheet producers, containerboard is one uniform market as corrugated board can consist of a mixture
of any type of linerboard or fluting depending on end use and quality requirements. Corrugated board can come in a range
of types, including single face, single wall, double wall, or triple wall, depending on the ultimate packaging application.

Corrugated board is eventually converted by corrugated box producers into regular slotted containers (RSC), die-cut boxes
or other containers, and sold to brand owners or packers before reaching retailers and end-consumers. The main end-use
segment in Europe is food, beverages, fast-moving consumer goods, long-lasting goods, packaging for ecommerce and
packaging for transportation, although the breakdown varies by country. Kraftliner is used especially in the food segment
if there is direct contact with food, where strength and purity are important requirements, whereas testliner is generally
used in non-food fast-moving consumer goods and consumer durables as well as in the food segment if there is no direct
contact with food.

In Western Europe, recovered paper is the main raw material for the production of recycled containerboard and other fiber
packaging boards. Recycled containerboard constitutes approximately 83% of containerboard production, with kraftliner
constituting the remainder. In Europe, containerboard manufacturers tend to source the majority of their raw materials from
external suppliers. The industry is typically viewed as comprising two main production activities: (i) the production of


-----

containerboard and corrugated board; and (ii) the conversion of corrugated board into corrugated containers or other
fiber-based packaging products. There are several operating models within the containerboard and corrugated board
industry. The majority of containerboard suppliers are forward integrated such that they also operate in corrugated board
and box conversion. This can allow a greater degree of control over raw material flows and pricing. Others keep a more
restricted focus on particular high-value sections of the production process, and distribute products to independent sheet
plants.

We focus on the highly efficient production and processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of
corrugated board sheets for our mostly family-owned customers in the packaging industry. We believe we differentiate
ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated paper and packaging producers) through our strategic focus
on those elements of the value chain that bring added-value to our customers in the packaging industry, i.e., the efficient
and integrated production of containerboard and corrugated board. Unlike fully integrated packaging manufacturers, we
do not produce boxes. This strategic positioning means that we are not a competitor to our customers who focus on the
conversion of corrugated board into corrugated containers. Despite having the ability to produce kraftliner, we focus on
testliner production for the European market.

**INDUSTRY FUNDAMENTALS AND DRIVERS**

The containerboard and corrugated board industry is relatively capital intensive and competitive. Long-term demand for
these products is driven by global economic trends, demographic trends, technological developments and trends in end
customers' preferences. Profitability is sensitive to changes in prices, and industry profit cycles reflect the constantly
shifting balance between supply and demand for individual products.

**Macro demand drivers and industry trends**

A number of factors underlie the growth of corrugated packaging, the end product of containerboard and corrugated board.
The growth of the general economy, industrial production and merchandise trade are the main demand drivers for
containerboard and corrugated board packaging. Private consumption as well as the increased use of substitutes
(e.g. plastic) also drive the development of retail sales.

The charts below show the evolution of Euro area industrial production, Euro area GDP and containerboard demand growth
in Western Europe and Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, based on available data from RISI.

Historically, there has been a strong correlation between GDP growth, industrial production and demand growth for
recycled containerboard. In Western Europe, demand has grown faster than industrial production since 2012 and surged to
high levels in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic shifted consumer consumption from services to goods, which reinforced
consumption of containerboard. However, after the strict lockdowns were removed, consumer behavior changed and
purchasing shifted back to services. Consequently, the containerboard growth trend started to slow down towards the end
of 2021 and in early 2022. The Russian war in Ukraine also brought a number of consequences for the economy, with
disruption in energy supply leading to energy prices increase to all-time highs in the second half of 2022. Therefore, the
European manufacturing sector suffered throughout the year from uncertain energy supply and rising manufacturing costs.
High inflation and rising living costs also affect consumers, significantly reducing their purchasing power. This meant a
rapid change in consumption behavior related to packaged good, and the higher containerboard demand seen in early 2022
fell significantly in the second half of 2022 and 2023.

Demographic and lifestyle changes, including rising urbanization and demand for convenience, such as take-aways and
home deliveries, have driven growth in demand for corrugated packaging, and are expected to continue to do so especially
in Emerging Europe (defined by RISI as Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe). The effect of improvements in living
standards and consumer spending in Emerging Europe and other emerging markets is expected to further support growth
in demand. Development of the retail infrastructure in these markets, including online shopping and mail order, and the
development of the logistics market, is expected to increase demand for containerboard products such as die-cut containers,
shelf-ready packaging and decorative corrugated pieces. In addition, the booming agro-based sector, for example, is
expected to create new demand for containerboards by replacing the traditional wooden boxes with corrugated containers.

Containerboard demand is expected to also be increasingly exposed to the general tendency to reduce packaging costs, for
example with light-weight and reduced packaging. Plastics and returnable/reusable transit packs (RTP) are expected to
increasingly compete with corrugated board packaging, especially in mature markets and for fresh fruit and vegetables.
The future competitiveness of fiber-based packaging is expected to depend on innovation, product development, cost and
the industry’s ability in general to respond to changing market requirements.

The competitive position of containerboard and corrugated board is expected to remain relatively strong in comparison
with alternative materials. Recyclability, for example, is expected to have a favorable impact on containerboard demand
growth. The high recovery and recycling rate of wood fiber-based packaging compared to plastics is expected to benefit
the industry. The poor environmental image of plastics coupled with its higher cost are also expected to have a positive
impact on the demand prospects for fiber-based packaging in mature markets.

Some of the newer products, such as microflutes, are expected to support the use of containerboards and corrugated boards
in the competition against folding cartons. In addition, retail- and shelf-ready packaging has opened new opportunities for
corrugated board and has brought it closer to the consumers. Logistic and shelf space planning are key competitive
advantages against other packaging substrates.

Recycled containerboard capacity has steadily gained share of the Western European containerboard market over the last
15 years, accounting for approximately 83% in 2023. The growing importance of recycled containerboard has been driven
by a variety of reasons, including (i) lower prices of both PfR and recycled containerboard versus virgin grades, (ii)
improving quality of testliner products and kraftliner substitutes, (iii) efforts by consumer goods companies to burnish their
sustainability and consumer demand for recycled products leading to a surge in kraftliner substitutes and (iv) market
undersupply of unbleached kraft pulp.


-----

Like in Western Europe, the containerboard market in Emerging Europe is dominated by recycled grades. Usage of recycled
containerboard has increased substantially as a share of the total over the last 15 years within Emerging Europe. Recycled
products represented 60% of regional containerboard consumption in the last years of the 1990s, but the share has increased
recently. Expanding availability of high-quality recycled grades, partially from Western European suppliers, and a greater
focus on sustainability were major drivers of the rising share of recycled products.

Containerboard is generally a regional business, and the majority of the volumes is traded within Europe. However, some
regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa, are net importers of containerboard. Hence, the demand from exports
of the containerboard market is partially influenced by the evolution of the EUR/USD exchange rate.

**END-MARKETS DYNAMICS**

Demand for corrugated containers is primarily driven by the need for (i) packaging products for the transportation of a
diverse range of consumer and industrial goods, such as processed and fresh food, agricultural products, beverages,
industrial and consumer electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and a range of other products and (ii) higher
value-added corrugated products, such as those featuring enhanced graphics used for point-of-sale displays and consumer
and shelf-ready packaging.

In Europe, the main markets are the developed Western European countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain and the
United Kingdom. Poland and other Eastern European countries are smaller markets, but are anticipated to grow at a faster
rate than the more developed markets.

In Europe, fast moving consumer goods account for a large share of corrugated board consumption, offering certain stability
against economic fluctuations. However, there are clear differences between countries. Industrial products are the primary
driver in Germany while food and consumer goods dominate in the United Kingdom and France. Germany is the leading
corrugated board market followed by Italy. The share of sheets is also estimated to be the highest in Italy, followed by the
United Kingdom and Poland, according to Vision Hunters.

**Key supply parameters**

Containerboard is manufactured either by treating virgin fibers or by cleaning and screening recycled fibers before passing
these through paper machines, which are comprised of a paper-forming section, a press section (where water is squeezed
out), a drying section and the finishing. The containerboard is then wound into rolls and shipped to corrugated board plants.

Containerboard mills are large, capital intensive production facilities and the production landscape is continuously
changing as a result of new capacity additions and closures. As there is a significant lead time between the planning and
completion of new containerboard machines, the supply side tends to lag behind changes in demand.

Furthermore, the containerboard production process is reasonably specialized, such that there is very limited flexibility to
switch from containerboard production to the production of other paperboard grades, or from kraftliner to testliner (or vice
versa), in response to market conditions.


-----

Corrugated sheets are interim products manufactured from containerboard at a sheet feeder plant or an integrated corrugated
and converting plant. Corrugated sheets are then converted into corrugated containers at integrated converting plants or at
sheet plants. The corrugated sheet is first printed, if required, and then formed into the final container (or box) shape usually
by some combination of die-cutting, folding, gluing, stapling or stitching the sheet. Corrugated containers are designed
specifically to meet individual customer requirements and there is a wide variety of designs available.

Corrugated sheets are bulky products, which tend to be produced and supplied locally due to high transportation costs,
requirements of customers for supply chain integration and just-in-time delivery. The economic supply distance for
corrugated sheets is typically around 300 kilometers. Therefore, there are many corrugated board plants and the market in
Europe is more fragmented than the containerboard market.

Since the early 2000s, there has been a significant development in the European containerboard industry and its asset base:
more than 15 new machines have started up, all of which are capable of producing the full range of recycled fiber grades.
This is part of a constant push towards increasing efficiency and lowering manufacturing costs in order to ensure
competitiveness. These manufacturing costs are exposed to raw material prices and availability (recovered paper vs. virgin
pulp). The response from the suppliers has been to use cheaper raw materials both in containerboard and corrugated
packaging production.

There have been shut-downs in Europe, but these have typically been of old and narrow machines with weak cost
competitiveness and suboptimal trim fit and/or product portfolio. Shut-downs have typically been part of companies’ asset
strategy, and their volumes have typically been compensated by capacity increases in other production units. The
production landscape is described in greater detail below under “—Containerboard supply developments and operating
_rates evolution in Europe”._

The European containerboard and corrugated board industry has experienced several trends affecting product and product
construction as well as production process. Some of the trends originate from the end users (retail, consumers and
brand-owners), but the industry itself has also managed to introduce new concepts. All these trends have raised the status
of corrugated board from pure transportation packaging closer to retail and even consumer packaging. The key trends can
be listed as follows:

  - Light weighting, which has extended to both containerboard and corrugated board. This is a response to
transportation cost pressure, as well as industry evolution and a trend towards eco-efficiency;

  - Small flutes and multiwall constructions are partly related to the light weighting as the introduction of lower basis
weight fluting has enabled the microflute concept and use of corrugated in consumer packages as well as
increasing need in heavy duty applications;

  - Die-cuts and point-of-sales (POS), which is to satisfy the demand for retail ready packaging;

  - White-top liners and high-quality printing are for direct use consumer packages and shelf ready packaging;
printing requirements are increasing in industrial packaging; and

  - Wider corrugators have been introduced to improve the efficiency at corrugated plants and better fit with new
containerboard machines.

**Pricing dynamics**

Containerboard prices are primarily a function of the prevailing supply-demand balance (in this respect, additional growth
has resulted from the strong increase in e-commerce volumes), raw material prices and other operating costs, such as
energy, chemicals and transportation.

Demand for containerboard has tended to develop in line with industrial growth rates due to the characteristics of the main
end-user markets for corrugated containers. In contrast, the supply side of the containerboard market is fairly inelastic
owing to capital intensity, long lead times between planning and completion of a mill and the low versatility of the paper
machines. This can result in temporary supply/demand imbalances driving prices up and down, such as those which have
been experienced in recent years.

Another driver of containerboard prices is the cost of the principal raw materials: recovered paper or virgin fiber. While
wood prices historically have been relatively stable, recovered paper prices can vary widely on a regional basis depending
on demand and tend to be volatile even within short time periods. Fluctuations in Asian demand and seasonal patterns of
collection and demand have been the principal factors driving the recovered paper price in recent years. Given the
significant implications of price fluctuations of recovered paper on business performance, we (as well as several other


-----

industry participants) have therefore sought better access to recovered paper through a broad supplier portfolio including
access to box plant clippings and direct supply contracts with municipalities or retailers from time to time. The cost of
producing containerboard is also influenced by the prices of energy, starch, chemicals and transportation. Energy prices,
in particular electricity, oil and natural gas, have experienced significant volatility in recent years, with a corresponding
effect on paper production costs.

Containerboard is the main cost factor of corrugated sheets and of corrugated packaging overall. Therefore, corrugated
sheets price usually follows containerboard price development with some delay, typically by about two to three months.

**KEY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS**

The corrugated box market in Western Europe has largely recovered from the economic crisis that impacted the region
after 2008: the 2007 pre-crisis demand peak for corrugated box was crossed in 2014. In the following years demand for
corrugated boxes increased further and reached a new peak in 2021. Total box shipments amounted to 39.9 billion m[2] in
2023, 2.1 billion m[2] less than in 2022. RISI is expecting shipments to increase by 3.2% in 2024, then grow by 2.7% in 2025
and 1.7% in 2026. Over the long run, European shipments are expected to grow by 1.3% annually between 2022 and 2032
according to Vision Hunters’ 2024 study (with Western Europe, Central Eastern Europe, and Southeastern Europe growing
by 1.1% per annum, 2.4% per annum and 2.4% per annum, respectively).

Recent softness in containerboard demand and declining old corrugated containers (“OCC”) and energy prices have put
downward pressure on containerboard prices. Destocking and softer volumes have led testliner prices fall down by more
than €250 per ton and kraftliner by more than €200 per ton (on average) in 2023. As a result, margins have decreased, and
many mills are not profitable at current price levels. Further price declines could impact the profitability of smaller
producers.

**Demand development in Europe**

_Western Europe_

Corrugated board and containerboard demand have declined since the second half of 2022 because of recent destocking
actions across the supply chain, which led to a decrease in output that created a market-related downtime for producers.
The slowdown in the European economy, high inflation and the Russian war in Ukraine together sped up the deceleration
in consumer goods consumption. The downturn in the manufacturing sector has pushed input prices down, while the
upswing in the service sector has continued to increase input costs, keeping overall inflation high. Growth in the service
sector, however, started to slow at the end of the second quarter amid an increased threat of a recession.

Soft corrugated board volumes hampered Western European containerboard demand, which dropped by 3.4% in 2022 as
compared to 2021. Only nominal improvement was seen in early 2023, as destocking issues did not get resolved despite
considerable slowdown in containerboard production. RISI forecasts Western European corrugated board shipments to
increase by 3.2% in 2024 and continue increasing by 2.7% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026.

_Emerging Europe_

Emerging Europe has historically consumed less corrugated board than Western Europe, given factors such as the region’s
population and GDP per capita. This led to higher growth rates and higher market volatility, especially in countries outside
of the European Union, where plastic substitution regulations either do not exist or are less strict. RISI expects Emerging
Europe to continue to outpace Western Europe in demand growth rates over the medium term. Growth in 2022 and 2023
has been lower, particularly in economic growth for Russia, Belarus and Ukraine due to the impact of the Russian war in
Ukraine.

Demand growth in Southeastern and Central Europe is expected to remain positive, and RISI expects it to return to its usual
rate of growth by 2024.

Despite the effects of the Russian war in Ukraine, RISI expects Emerging European demand to grow more than twice as
fast as that in Western Europe. This is expected to increase the importance of Emerging Europe in defining European
supply and demand balances throughout the entire forecast. By 2027, Emerging European boxboard is expected to account
for almost 37% of the total, up from 35% in 2021, according to RISI.

Corrugated board consumption has grown faster by sheet area than by volume during the past years due to the trend towards
lighter basis weights. This trend is expected to continue in the future with corrugated board based on light-weight
containerboard showing higher growth rates than the overall market, and future market growth expected to approximate
the levels between 2002 and 2007.

**Containerboard supply developments and operating rates evolution in Europe**

_Western Europe_

Net capacity expansion in the Western European containerboard industry came to a halt between 2007 and 2013 after
expanding rapidly during the 1990s and first half of the 2000s. There were a number of new capacities in the industry in
the period from 2014 to 2021. This capacity expansion was driven by new corrugated base paper machines and conversions
from fine paper machines to containerboard. Western European containerboard production decreased significantly in 2023,
and shipments fell 5.0% year-on-year in 2023. Although trade activity has improved, domestic demand has remained
subdued and has limited the production recovery.

European containerboard production is very energy intensive. On average, around two thirds of the energy needed to
produce recycled contoinerboard is provided by natural gas. Virgin containerboard producers, on the other hand, can use
energy synergies from their pulp mills, so on average less than 20% of their energy needs are fulfilled by natural gas.

Although prices for OCC and energy have decreased considerably since the third quarter of 2022, weak demand conditions
and destocking forced producers to curtail output. Consequently, RISI anticipated in 2023 that the recovery in supply would
be subdued in the second half of the year. RISI also expected that manufacturers would be forced to take additional
production curtailments in the second and third quarters of 2023 to adapt to demand levels, and that they would be preparing
to limit production in the second half of 2023 if demand conditions did not improve. As such, a rapid recovery was not
likely; instead, there was the possibility that destocking could continue longer into the second half of 2023, continuing to

limite containerboard demand in Western EuropeRISI estimates Western European corrugated board shipments will
increase by 3.2% in 2024, and continue improving in 2025 and 2026 by growing by 2.7% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. RISI
predicts that recycled containerboard capacity in Western Europe will increase by 2.1 million tons by 2025, pushing the
market deeper into oversupply conditions. Testliner operating rates are estimated to decline from 96% in 2021 to around
84 to 85% in 2024 and 2025 before increasing back up. A faster demand recovery alone will not support operating rates
rising back to average levels of around 94%. RISI estimates that profit margins will face downward pressure during this
period and might not start to increase until 2027. A faster demand recovery in the domestic and export markets, as well as
delays or cancellations of announced projects, could raise the operating rates back to 90% sooner and balance the markets.
All of these events would need to be realised in order to tighten market conditions more quickly in the near term, however.

To raise operating rates to 90% by 2025, the industry in Western Europe would need to cancel or permanently close 1.6
million tons of capacity between 2023 and 2025. Even then, operating rates would still be below near-term historical rates
of 93.7%, which suggests that further action might be needed to achieve market balance.

_Eastern Europe_

Containerboard capacity has expanded steadily in Emerging Europe since 2000, averaging growth of 424,000 tons per year.
Most of the investment in the earlier part of this period involved rebuilds of existing machines to both increase capacity
and improve quality. Over the past few years, new, state-of-the-art machines have been added, mainly in Central Europe
and Turkey. Closures of existing, inefficient capacity offset a substantial portion of the capacity originating from the new
machines. Regional containerboard capacity reached more than 12.7 million tons in 2018, up from just 5.1 million tons in
2000. The majority of the total expansion has been in the recycled sector.

Operating rates in Emerging Europe improved consistently from 2000 to 2007, rising from 82% to 89%. The abrupt
flattening in domestic demand in 2008 to 2009, along with a loss of share to imports from Western Europe and continuing
investment in new capacity, resulted in regional capacity utiliszation decreasing to 79% in 2009. However, operating rates
rebounded over the next four years, returning to 84% in 2013, and increasing to over 90% in 2021. This rate is expected to
be substantially below that rate in the next five years due to substantial capacity additions in Eastern Europe in the next
few years.

RISI anticipates that some production will move to the new, more efficient, lower-cost production units, transforming
operating rates across Europe.

**Containerboard price development in Europe**

Testliner prices have trended upward during the last 15 years, although extreme volatility has tended to mask this trend.
Real prices (in 2016 euros) averaged €382/ton in the latter part of the 1990s and have been around €479/ton over the period
from 2013 to 2020 and peaked to over €800/ton in 2022. The range in real prices during the last 20 years has been from a
peak of €800/ton in 2022 to a low of €321/ton in 2009. Both the trend and the range in real prices have been closely related
to movements in recovered paper costs, which have been erratic on an annual basis and rising in real terms on a secular
basis.

Containerboard prices remained stable until the second quarter of 2008, when prices started to decline as the rapid
weakening of the global economy decreased the demand for corrugated boxes (and containerboard). This was reflected in
decreased demand and prices for testliner. Containerboard demand started to increase at the end of 2009 and the upturn of
the economy was seen in Europe by mid-year 2010. Growth resumed in the international trade from early 2010 and the
external demand and prices for containerboard increased as well. In the following years the margin situation in the
containerboard industry improved steadily. The industry price to total cost ratio reached a peak of approximately 1.4 in
2018, remained on a comparably high level in the years 2019 to 2022 and dropped to around 1.2 in 2023 and is expected
to be closer to 1.1 for 2024 and 2025.

European testliner prices declined by approximately 20% from August 2011 to February 2012 due to the soft
supply/demand balance and lower recovered paper prices. Improved demand as well as the increase of recovered paper
prices turned testliner prices back to growth track in mid-February 2012. In the following years, prices increased slowly
until 2018 when the price level was not sustainable and prices declined in 2019 and 2020 as a result. Increasing demand
and inflation drove the price surge in 2021, when inflation led to a 44% increase to approximately €650/ton. This increase
is mostly due to macroeconomics developments leading to overall higher prices. Prices increased by an additional 30% in
2022 to approximately €840/ton before declining to around €590/ton in 2023.

All containerboard prices follow each other and recovered paper prices correlate well with them. Price difference between
recovered paper and testliner has been on average just above €300. During the recessional years 2008 to 2010, prices
dropped due to weak demand and the prices for testliner also dropped due to decline in raw material prices. After a steady
increase between 2013 and 2015, testliner prices have been coming down since the start of 2016 despite healthy demand
and no large capacity additions during the year.

More recently, soft containerboard demand and lower OCC and energy prices have put downward pressure on
containerboard prices. Due to destocking and soft demand, testliner prices have fallen more than €320/ton on average since
the second quarter of 2022. Margins have decreased significantly, and many mills are not profitable at current price levels.
Further price declines could threaten producers' profitability and push small, old and inefficient producers out of the market.
RISI expects testliner prices to fall further in the first quarter of 2024 before stabilizing. Mild price increases are possible
in the second half of the year if demand conditions improve and manufacturing costs increase faster than forecast.

**MARKET AND COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**

Containerboard products are largely standardized and, therefore, subject to substantial price competition. Price is also an
important driver of competition in the corrugated market. However, the corrugated market features a greater degree of
differentiation than containerboard, with customers’ purchasing decision also being based on a range of other factors,
including delivery lead time, quality of service, quality of product, consistency, quality of design and innovation in the
packaging itself.

Existing European containerboard producers benefit from certain barriers to entry, including:

  - the difficulty, especially in Western Europe, of finding appropriate locations (including proximity to reliable
sources of virgin fiber in the case of kraftliner production and recovered paper in the case of recycled
containerboard) to build new mills and obtaining approvals from local governments; and

  - substantial capital costs associated with building a new plant of the scale and quality necessary to be
cost-competitive with the production platforms of existing producers.

The corrugated board industry is more fragmented than containerboard and is comprised of a large number of small, often
family-owned and locally operating companies. Smurfit Kappa and DS Smith are, in terms of scale, significantly larger
than any other competitors in the market.

According to Vision Hunters, Progroup Board is the number three producer and largest independent corrugated board
producer in Europe by volume produced as well as the only one focusing on sheet feeding. Progroup Paper is the number
six producer of recycled containerboard in Europe by capacity.

Many of our competitors are fully integrated and focus on serving larger end-customers in large batch sizes, including
global consumer corporates. Our differentiated business model allows us to serve a higher number of customers, process a
higher number of orders and maintain higher production volumes (up to 450 million square meters per annum on one
corrugator), thereby generating economies of scale. We are solely focused on the production process as opposed to many
of our competitors, who also focus on more complex and customer-specific packaging requirements for a smaller number
of larger customers and, hence, only have a production output of typically 80 to 90 million square meters per annum. Our
operational model allows for significantly higher productivity levels compared with industry average, according to Vision
Hunters.

Over the past 32 years since our foundation, we have achieved leading market positions in the countries in which we
operate. According to Vision Hunters, we are among the top three corrugated board producers in Europe (by production
capacity) and we are also the only one focusing on the sheet feeding segment. In our core market segment, namely
corrugated board sheets, we are the market leader by volumes sold in Germany, Poland, Austria, Belgium, the Czech
Republic and the Netherlands and hold considerably higher market shares compared to our position in the overall European
containerboard and corrugated board market, according to Vision Hunters. In containerboard production, we have a market
share of approximately 4% by production capacity, according to Vision Hunters.

Unlike many of our competitors, who grew historically over many decades or had to integrate production infrastructures
inorganically through acquisitions, we differentiate ourselves with a well-invested asset base and high-quality,
complementary, modern and strictly aligned, high capacity production facilities placed purposefully in strategic locations.
Our strategy has enabled us to experience above market growth rates resulting from organic growth alone. More recently,
production started at our latest PW14 high-tech plant at Stryków in Poland. With the neighbouring PW07 plant, the new
Progroup plant will have an estimated capacity of up to 825 million square metres per year. In October 2023, we have
started building our next corrugated sheetfeeder plant (PW16) in the Italian town of Cessalto (Veneto), which will be the
site of a sustainable packaging park.

Our paper plants are among the largest and youngest in the European recycled containerboard industry. According to Vision
Hunters, the industry average capacity is 171,000 tons per plant and the average technical age of plants is 23.5 years. The
chart below demonstrates our continued focus on innovation and high-quality assets, with most of our competitors’ plants
considered as candidates for restructuring due to high technical age and small size.

**BUSINESS**

**OUR COMPANY**

We are a leading, family-owned producer and supplier of containerboard and corrugated board in Central Europe and are
headquartered in Landau, Germany. According to Vision Hunters, we are the third largest producer of corrugated board in
Europe (by production capacity) through our corrugated board business (“Board”) and the fifth largest producer of recycled
containerboard in Europe (by production capacity) through our containerboard business (“Paper”). We focus on the highly
efficient production and processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of corrugated board sheets
for our mostly family-owned box manufacturing customers. In this core market segment, we are the market leader by
volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands, according to Vision Hunters,
and following significant recent and ongoing investments, we have also been becoming a significant market player in Italy
and the United Kingdom. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated paper
and packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that bring added-value to our
customers in the packaging industry, i.e., the automated and integrated production of containerboard and corrugated board.
Our customers serve various end markets, including industrial/manufacturing, consumer durables, processed foods, nonfood manufactured consumer goods and fresh food. Unlike many fully integrated market players, we do not produce boxes
and therefore do not compete with our box manufacturing customers but instead focus solely on the production of
containerboard and corrugated board. We are part of the circular economy as the end products made with our corrugated
board and containerboard can serve as raw materials in our business after use by the end customer. In addition, we thermally
utilize foreign materials present in the recovered paper we use as a our main raw material as well as production residues
from our paper manufacturing processes in our waste-to-energy plant. This enables us to generate the steam required for
paper production at PM2 as well as a portion of our electricity requirements ourselves. In our paper mills, we almost
exclusively use recovered paper as a raw material for the production of containerboard. We use containerboard made from
recovered paper as much as possible in our corrugated board formats. This enables us to reduce the use of virgin fiber paper
(kraftliner) and thereby the amount of virgin pulp used in the production of our corrugated board.

Through our large scale and highly flexible production, built up primarily via a greenfield approach and, more recently,
via packaging park projects, we are able to realize significant economies of scale. Since we commenced operations in 1992,
we have carefully selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a
greenfield strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we operate.
As a result, we believe we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high technological standards,
resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and relatively low requirements for additional
capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the high technological standards of our production facilities, we
believe we are well-positioned to benefit from major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for lightweight packaging, (ii) the increasing importance of small-size packaging due to the growing importance of e-commerce,
and (iii) the general trend towards a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and energy, which can help reduce
costs, CO2 emissions and fresh water consumption.

Our core business comprises Paper and Board. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible containerboard production
using almost exclusively recovered paper, with high output volumes to increase cost efficiency and short delivery times.
Following the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up of our third and newest paper machine (PM3)
in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, Paper has the capacity to meet the majority of the containerboard sourcing requirements


-----

of our corrugated board production within Board (i.e., we are currently a net seller of containerboard). We believe that a
high degree of vertical integration and the ability of Board to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in
a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. In addition, our customers benefit
from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options.

Paper manufactures containerboard at our three paper mills in Germany, with an envisaged total annual production capacity
of approximately 1,850,000 tons of containerboard. Our three existing paper machines, PM1 in Burg, PM2 in
Eisenhüttenstadt and PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, have complementary production layouts which allow us to produce
brown containerboard with grammages between 60 to 230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recovered paper. This, in turn,
allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the appropriate widths for Board’s twelve
existing corrugated board plants in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a
total annual production capacity of approximately 1,815,000 tons of corrugated board, including our latest corrugated board
“mega plant” (PW14) at Strykow, Poland with an annual corrugated board production acpacity of approximately 200,000
tons, which started commercial production in January 2023. Our historic greenfield location strategy ensures close customer
proximity and high production flexibility. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we further acquired Progroup
Power 1 GmbH, the waste-to-engery plant adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt and certain related assets. As a
result, we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2
ourselves (“Power”). In addition, we already started construction of a further waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) at the site of
PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, to supply our paper machine PM3 with the majority of the required process heat as well as a
significant portion of the required electricity.

In 2023, we sold approximately 1,494,000 tons of corrugated board and approximately 403,000 tons of containerboard to
external customers across Europe, resulting in external corrugated board and containerboard sales, respectively, of
€1,129.8 million (85.6% of total sales) and €166.7 million (12.6% of total sales). Paper’s total sales in 2023 include
€7.6 million (0.6% of total sales) in revenues from the incineration of waste at our existing waste-to-energy plant in
Eisenhüttenstadt. Total external sales by Board and Paper in 2023 (including sales other than corrugated board or
containerboard sales, respectively, such as revenues from incineration of waste at our waste-to-energy plant) amounted to
€1,136.7 million (86.1% of total sales) and €167.8 million (12.7% of total sales). Our total sales and EBITDA in 2023
amounted to €1,320.0 million and €200.8 million, respectively. Sales in Germany (by destination), our core market,
accounted for 35% of total sales and 34% of sales by volume in 2023.

Primarily to support our core business, Paper and Board, we have established our own logistics operations, including a
fleet of currently 59 trucks (“Logistics”). Most of the remaining €15.5 million in sales (1.2% of total sales) in 2023 were
generated by Logistics.

Founded in 1991, we are indirectly majority-owned by Jürgen Heindl, our founder and vice chairman of our supervisory
board (the “Supervisory Board”), Maximilian Heindl, our chief executive officer and Vinzenz Heindl.

**OUR STRENGTHS**

We believe we benefit from the following competitive strengths.

**Differentiated business model with leading market positions in attractive market environment**

Our founder and vice chairman of our Supervisory Board, Jürgen Heindl, designed a business model differentiating us
from our competitors. Through our strategic value chain positioning in containerboard and corrugated board production


-----

only, we do not compete with our targeted customers, who are primarily family-owned, small- and medium-sized
businesses. Our core customers focus on packaging solutions for the end-customer and typically do not have their own
corrugated board production capability. Many of our competitors are fully integrated and focus on serving larger endcustomers in large batch sizes, including global consumer corporates. Our differentiated business model allows us to serve
a higher number of customers, process a higher number of orders and maintain higher production volumes per production
site (up to 450 million square meters of corrugated board per annum), thereby generating economies of scale. We are solely
focused on the production process as opposed to many of our competitors, who also focus on more complex and customerspecific packaging requirements for a smaller number of larger customers and, hence, only have an average production
output of typically 80 to 90 million square meters per production site per annum.

In 32 years since our foundation, we have achieved leading market positions in the countries in which we operate. We are
among the top three corrugated board producers in Europe (by production capacity) and our market share in our specific
segment, the corrugated sheet market in Europe, was approximately 19% according to February 2024 market research by
Vision Hunters. In our core market segment, namely corrugated board sheets, we were the market leader by volumes sold
in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland and the Netherlands, according to Vision Hunters, and we hold
considerably higher market shares in those markets compared to our position in the overall European containerboard and
corrugated board market. In Germany, we have been further expanding our leading market position in recent years with (i)
the start of production at a new corrugated board plant (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with an annual corrugated board
production capacity of approximately 135,000 tons, in November 2019, (ii) the start of production at our third and newest
paper machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, with an annual capacity of approximately 750,000 tons of
containerboard, in August 2020, (iii) the ongoing construction of a new corrugated board “mega plant” (PW15) in
Petersberg, Germany, with an expected annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons and
test production expected to commence in the first half of 2024, as a packaging park project right next door to our longstanding customer and partner G&G Preißer, and (iv) the start of construction of a new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) at
the site of PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, to supply our paper machine PM3 with the required process heat as well as
electricity.

We have also become market leader in the Polish market, following the start of production at our corrugated board
production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland in 2017 and the start of commercial production in January 2023 and ongoing
ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14), with an annual corrugated board production capacity of
approximately 200,000 tons, right next to our earlier corrugated board plant (PW7) in Strykow, Poland. Similarly, we have
also become a significant player in the UK market, following the commencement of production in January 2019 and
subsequent ramp-up at our corrugated board “mega plant” (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, with an annual
corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, which replaced the much smaller and
decommissioned production site PW8. In addition, the commencement of production at our corrugated board production
site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in March 2018, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately
135,000 tons, marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. We also commenced construction
of a further corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy in the fourth quarter of 2023 and expect production
to commence at the new site in the first half of 2025. In the corrugated sheet market, we had a market share of approximately
19% in 2022 in Europe, according to the February 2024 market research by Vision Hunters.

While we believe our differentiated business model, high reliability and quality of product supply, significant scale, internal
sourcing and geographic coverage provide us with a competitive advantage in our core market segment, we also benefit
from attractive market fundamentals of the overall industry.

Over many years, the paper and packaging industry has experienced overall growing demand from industrial economies in
Central Europe, and we believe that Germany and Central Europe, our key markets, generally provide a positive economic
outlook. The last two years have been slightly negatively impacted by softness in containerboard and corrugated board
demand as well as destocking trends. However, structural growth trends such as rising urbanization, increasing demand for
convenience (i.e., take-aways and home deliveries) or sustainability awareness should drive the demand recovery expected
by RISI and Vision Hunters in the next 4 to 5 years, as mentioned under “Industry and Competition”. From a product
perspective, the increasing significance of light-weight paper and packaging solutions as well as small-size packaging and
the increasingly online and mail order-driven retail sector is expected to further stimulate packaging growth. We believe
our modern production facilities, particularly PM2, which is capable of producing light-weight paper grades economically
on a commercial scale, and PM3, which is one of world’s largest and most modern and high-performance paper mills,
position us well to benefit from these growth trends in the industry. Furthermore, production is driven by the strong increase
in demand from emerging economies, where production and packaging standards are adapting to the standards of developed
countries, from which we also benefit with our production in Poland and the Czech Republic.


-----

**Uniquely designed, best-in-class and strategically located, low-cost production asset base built up via greenfield**
**strategy**

Since our foundation in 1991, we have carefully designed and selected our production operations and locations via a
dedicated greenfield strategy to establish highly efficient, flexible and technologically advanced production facilities. We
believe we continue to be the fastest organically growing corrugated board producer in Europe and have developed a unique
track record and expertise in successfully establishing new greenfield corrugated board production sites. This includes a
dedicated and experienced in-house projects team tasked with identifying attractive market opportunities for profitable
growth, completing the planning and construction phases of the relevant projects on time and on budget and managing fast
and successful ramp-ups of production at the relevant sites.

Designing our production set-up primarily via a greenfield strategy allowed us to invest in the best available production
specifications and optimize the alignment and compatibility of our paper machines, PM1, PM2 and PM3, with our
corrugators. The current 2.5m, 2.8m and 3.3m trim widths of our various existing corrugated board plants can be very
efficiently combined with the 5.8m trim width of PM1 (2 × 2.8m or 2.5m + 3.3m), the 10.2m trim width of PM2 (4 × 2.5m
or 3 × 3.3m) and the 9.2m trim width of our newest paper machine PM3 (2 × 3.3m + 2.5m or 2 × 2.8m + 3.3m), resulting
in low volumes of cutting scrap and higher productivity.

Our corrugated board production sites have been purposefully located approximately 500 kilometers from each other. This
footprint ensures close customer proximity with full regional coverage of our customers and limited overlap to limit the
transportation distance in most circumstances to 250 to 300 kilometers. Our strategic footprint also allows us to achieve
high production flexibility and reliable just-in-time delivery with short lead times. Furthermore, we are able to serve our
customers from different locations, thereby optimizing transportation costs and capacity utilizations on a plant-by-plant
basis, which is coordinated centrally from our headquarters in Landau following a “one mill approach”. We believe our
location layout and organization give us a competitive advantage in terms of cost efficiency and customer orientation. On
average, we serve approximately 50 to 80 customers per corrugated board production site and each of our production sites
offers the entire range of customer services (e.g., 24 hour delivery and online ordering and tracking).

We believe that all of our plants are equipped with state-of-the-art technology, which is the foundation of our low-cost and
efficient production. According to Vision Hunters, the asset quality of our paper machines is characterized as high and
above comparable European containerboard and corrugated board producers. Performance metrics of PM1, such as
capacity and technical age, are well above the industry average. PM2, which we believe to be among the world’s most
advanced paper machines for recycled super-light-weight paper and which specializes in the production of super-lightweight to medium-weight containerboard with grammages of 60 to 130g/m[2], ranks best in class for all metrics and has set
six new world records since its launch in 2010. PM3 is not only one of the world’s most modern and high-performance
paper machines for manufacturing environmentally friendly and high-quality containerboard, but also one of the world’s
largest paper mills.

Unlike many of our competitors, who grew historically over many decades or had to integrate production infrastructures
inorganically through acquisitions, we differentiate ourselves through our well-invested asset base and high-quality,
complementary, modern and strictly aligned, high capacity production facilities placed purposefully in strategic locations.

**Strong, diversified and long-standing customer base**

We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, some of which date back to the start of our operations
in 1992. We have grown with our large German customers as they have expanded across Europe and have successfully
entered into new relationships with key customers outside of Germany. We currently supply 350 to 400 different Board
customers, with a strategic focus on family-owned, small and medium-sized companies. Our top five Board customers
accounted only for approximately 6%, 5%, 5%, 3% and 3%, respectively, of our total corrugated board sales, by tons, in
2023, while our top five external Paper customers accounted for approximately 15%, 9%, 6%, 5% and 4%, respectively,
of our total external containerboard sales, by tons, in 2023.

We believe that our ability to provide reliable delivery of high-quality, cost-effective and tailor-made products and being
a family-owned business have enabled us to foster strong partnerships of mutual dependence with our mostly family-owned
customers, operating as a fundamental part of their supply chains by improving inventory management, security of supply
and customer service.

Our strong customer relationships are reinforced through a combination of our geographic reach, our manufacturing and
logistics excellence, and the limited availability of alternative suppliers with the capacity and geographic proximity to
provide a competitive offering. At a number of our corrugated board production sites, certain long-standing customers have
established their own box manufacturing plants in immediate proximity to our site, either on our own land or on land
adjacent to our site (so-called “Packaging Park 1 Model”). As a variation of this original packaging park model, we
commenced production in October 2015 at our corrugated board production site (PW09) in Plössberg, Germany, which we


-----

established in immediate proximity to an existing packaging plant of our customer, Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk, on land
owned by our customer. As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced production in the first quarter
of 2017 at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we purchased from our large customer
Janmar Centrum adjacent to its existing packaging plant. We refer to these variations where we establish our own
corrugated board production sites close to our customers as the “Packaging Park 2 Model”. Following the success of
these two packaging park projects (PW09 and PW10), we also established our corrugated board production site (PW11) in
Drizzona, Italy as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of our customer, Italian
packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l., and we are currently constructing yet another new corrugated board plant (PW15)
in Petersberg, Germany, with test production expected to commence in the first half of 2024, right next door to our longstanding customer and partner G&G Preißer. The next corrugated board plant (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy, which is expected
to commence test production in 2025, is being built next door to our customer Ondulkart.

All versions of the packaging park model help us to further strengthen our relationships with key customers or win
significant new customers (as in the case of Imbal Carton S.r.l. in 2018) and benefit both us and the relevant customers.
The high level of integration between our own corrugated board production and the box production of our customers
allowed by the packaging park model creates a number of efficiencies and largely eliminates freight and other freight
expenses between Board and our packaging park customers. This business model does not require pallets, simplifying the
delivery process. Our packaging park customers also typically purchase almost all of their corrugated board requirements
for the relevant box plant from us, which ensures predictable, high volume orders and consistently high utilization levels
for the relevant corrugated board production sites. Index pricing arrangements with our packaging park customers further
ensure a predictable pricing mechanism for all parties. It typically takes approximately two to three months for
containerboard mills to pass on their raw material price increases to their customers, i.e. manufacturers of corrugated board.
In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard cost increases. It
generally takes approximately two to three months for corrugated board manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases
on to their customers, although the extent and speed with which we are able to pass on cost increases to our customers, if
at all, can vary significantly, depending on prevailing market conditions.

**Technology and innovation leader**

There are general industry trends towards lighter and more functional packaging and towards a more efficient use of
resources. The trend towards “light paper” (i.e., containerboard) has been particularly strong in Germany and has been
further strengthened by the increasingly online and mail order-driven retail sector, which is expected to further stimulate
demand growth for light packaging solutions. From a sustainability point of view, many end consumers are increasingly
asking for optimized packaging (avoiding over-packaging) and lighter packaging (only as much packaging as necessary),
which also requires suitable lightweight containerboard grades. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to
capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany, which specializes in the production of superlight-weight to medium-weight containerboard with grammages of 60 to 130g/m[2]. As demand for super-light-weight
containerboard (with a grammage below 90g/m[2]) is increasing, we believe that PM2 gives us a significant advantage over
many of our competitors, both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Our newest paper machine PM3, on the other
hand, is designed to provide standard containerboard grades with grammages of 90 to 130g/m². Since this newest paper
machine commenced operation in August 2020, it has given us the ability to put an even stronger focus on the production
of super-light-weight containerboard (i.e. 70 to 80g/m[2]) at PM2 and to focus production at PM1 on specialty containerboard


-----

such as kraftliner substitutes and containerboard with a higher grammages above 130g/m². We believe that this added
specialization of our paper machines has further enhanced the productivity of all our paper machines as each paper mill is
now able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. For more detail, see also “—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen
_our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled investments” below._

In addition, we continuously work to improve our product designs, optimize the utilization of our assets and explore new
ways to further reduce our input costs and secure the long-term sustainability of our core businesses, both from an economic
and environmental perspective. In particular, we are focused on further reducing the use of fiber (i.e., recovered paper) in
our products as well as the amount of energy required for our production processes and the shipment of our products, in
order to both maintain a competitive cost position in our industry and to reduce emissions and waste.

We believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001, our paper machine PM1 was the world’s technologically most advanced
containerboard paper machine, setting new technology standards, including with the use of a closed water cycle, thereby
minimizing the creation of waste water. Launched in 2010, we believe that PM2 remains among the world’s most advanced
paper machines, which we believe has allowed us to set new industry standards with respect to raw material efficiency. As
described in more detail under “—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated
_board producer in Europe through controlled investments” below, we further decided to make certain significant additional_
investments in connection with the establishment of our newest paper machine (PM3). We believe these investments will
result in significant cost savings in the mid- to long-term as well as significant reductions of CO2 emissions, waste water
and natural gas consumption. These investments include a state-of-the-art overall waste-heat concept as well as a “first-ofits-kind” closed cycle waste water treatment system, and we have also commenced construction of a new waste-to-energy
plant at our site in Sandersdorf-Brehna, to supply PM3 with the majority of the required process heat as well as a significant
portion of the required electricity.

We have further invested significantly in the development of a “green” range of “next generation” products working in
close cooperation with BHS Corrugated GmbH, one of our equipment suppliers, and a team of researchers at the University
of Applied Sciences (Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften) in Regensburg, Germany. We market these products
under our own brands next fibre[®], next board[®] and next box[®]. All of these product innovations involve the use of superlight-weight containerboard produced by our paper machine PM2 as well as innovative flute designs of our corrugated
board formats, intended to further reduce raw material input and thereby further reduce weight, input costs and CO2
emissions.

**Significant synergies through high degree of vertical integration**

In 2023, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for approximately 76% of the containerboard, by volume, used by
our corrugated board production within Board. As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production
capacity over the years, internal containerboard sales to Board had increased steadily from approximately 71% (or 83%, if
we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to
approximately 87% (or 96%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume,
of Paper in 2019. This meant that we had accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been
operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board
and had even temporarily become a net purchaser of containerboard, i.e., the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements
of our corrugated board production within Board significantly exceeded the internal supply capacities of Paper.

With the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up at our third and newest paper machine (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, with an annual capacity of approximately 750,000 tons of containerboard, the volume of
our external containerboard sales significantly increased again. As a result, internal containerboard sales to Board decreased
to approximately 82% (or 92%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by
volume, of Paper in 2020, approximately 75% (or 87%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2021 and
approximately 75% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2022. Due to the further ramp-up of
PM3, internal containerboard sales to Board as a percentage of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper remained
fairly stable at approximately 74% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2023. We expect that
(i) the start of production in January 2023 and ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in
Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, (ii) the expected
start of test production in the first half of 2024 and subsequent ramp-up at our proposed corrugated board “mega plant”
(PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, and (iii) our further proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy
alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we expect to be
operating again at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and
Board and again become a net purchaser of containerboard in the mid-term. For more details on our expansion projects and
investment program, see also “—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated
_board producer in Europe through controlled investments” below. With an envisaged total annual containerboard capacity_
of approximately 1,850,000 tons, Paper produced approximately 1,574,000 tons and 1,607,000 tons of containerboard in
2023 and 2021, respectively. In 2023, approximately 1,153,000 tons were sold internally to Board (2021: 1,187,000 tons


-----

of internal containerboard sales), and a further approximately 163,000 tons were sold pursuant to swap agreements with
other containerboard producers (2021: 194,000 tons of sales to swap partners), which allow us to reduce transportation
costs, optimize our production program and swap internally produced containerboard for certain containerboard grades we
do not produce in sufficient quantities, such as kraftliner. The remaining approximately 241,000 tons of containerboard we
sold in 2023 were sold externally (2021: approximately 206,000 tons of external containerboard sales, excluding sales to
swap partners). With a total annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,815,000 tons (including
200,000 tons of capacity of our new corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, which commenced
commercial production in January 2023, but excluding a further 200,000 tons of capacity of our proposed corrugated board
“mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, which is expected to commence production in the second quarter of 2024)
(2021: total annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,615,000 tons), Board produced approximately
1,494,000 tons of containerboard in 2023, compared to approximately 1,504,000 tons of corrugated board in 2021. We
believe that a high degree of vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently highquality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. At the
same time, we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or improve our overall
Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared to corrugated board margins) of
certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, justin-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options. The steady increase in the degree of vertical integration between
Paper and Board over the last few years has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply
chain. See also “—Our Strategy—Achieving further cost-savings and efficiency improvements through further increased
_external containerboard purchases” below._

**Strong track record of profitable growth**

Since 2015, we successfully completed a number of recent expansion and other investment projects, including the
acquisition of our waste-to-energy plant at the site of PM2 in Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany as well as the successful
establishment of six new corrugated board plants (PW09, PW10, PW11, PW12, PW13 and PW14) and our third and newest
paper machine PM3. Furthermore, we initiated additional investment projects with the construction of a new waste-toenergy plant (PPO2) at the site of PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany and the construction of our new corrugated board
plant (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, which are both progressing on schedule as well as the construction for yet another
corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy having started in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, we
successfully implemented a series of initiatives in recent years as part of our Continuous Improvement Program to improve
the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities, optimize (i.e., minimize) our variable costs and stabilize our specific
fixed costs in order to achieve sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost leaders in the recycled
containerboard market.

As a result of these and other factors, and notwithstanding the significant challenges and uncertainties we faced due to the
COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine in recent years, we have managed to continue to deliver consistently strong
profitability and cash generation, and continued to moved the Group to a structurally enhanced level of profitability. In
particular, we have managed to deliver EBITDA of €152.9 million in 2015, €154.7 million in 2016, €180.4 million in 2017,
€275.5 million in 2018, €223,2 million in 2019, €178.1 million in 2020, €273.2 million in 2021, €412.0 million in 2022
and €200.8 million in 2023. Combined with our controlled investment strategy, which should normally allow us to adapt
the amount of our expansion capital expenditures in line with our projected mid-term cash requirement, we believe we are
in a strong financial condition to weather and/or adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole.

**Committed family shareholders and experienced management team for long-term stability**

Our company was founded in 1991 by Jürgen Heindl, who continues to serve as vice-chairman of our Supervisory Board
and controls our company with his two sons, Maximilian Heindl, our chief executive officer, and Vinzenz Heindl. We
believe this family link and the strong personal and long-standing financial commitment of our owners ensure our focus
on stability, long-term value generation and prudent investment strategies. After 30 years at the helm of the Group, Jürgen
Heindl handed over the leadership of the Group to his son and former deputy, Maximilian Heindl, effective January 1,
2023, but we continue to benefit from Jürgen Heindl’s expertise and experience in his role as vice-chairman of the
Supervisory Board. After gaining several years of relevant work and management experience in the paper industry outside
the Group, Maximilian Heindl joined the Group in August 2016 as the manager in charge of production and technology at
Paper (PM1 and PM2) and with overall responsibility for Power. From August 1, 2017, Maximilian Heindl took over
further responsibility within the Group as a deputy member of the Executive Board. Effective January 1, 2019, he became
a regular member of the Executive Board and assumed the role of chief development officer, responsible, among other
things, for overseeing the planning, construction and commissioning of our newest paper machine PM3. On July 1, 2021,
he assumed the role of deputy chief executive officer before becoming our chief executive officer on January 1, 2023.
Maximilian Heindl’s work and management experience outside the Group, his management roles at Paper and Power, his
appointment to the Executive Board and gradual assumption of further responsibilities were all part of a deliberate, longterm succession plan of our founder and former chief executive officer Jürgen Heindl, with the goal of securing our future
as a successful family-owned business into the next generation.

In response to the increasing size and complexity of the Group and to free up management capacity, we have further
professionalized and expanded our senior management team, including our Executive Board. Dr. Volker Metz rejoined the
Group as our chief financial officer in November 2016, after previously having served as our head of controlling between
2009 and 2016. Dr. Marc Sesterhenn joined the Group as our chief operations officer in October 2023, and our Supervisory
Board has further appointed Beate Flamm as chief culture and communication officer and fourth member of our Executive
Board effective May 1, 2024, when she is expected to assume, amongst other areas, responsibility for human resources as
well internal and external communication. Jürgen Heindl’s, Maximilian Heindl’s, Volker Metz’s, Marc Sesterhenn’s and
Beate Flamm’s expertise are supported by a strong management team with extensive industry experience, also within our
Group. Our management team has impressively demonstrated its abilities to create one of Europe’s leading containerboard
and corrugated board players while withstanding economic downturns and restructurings and striving through periods of
significant uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility and uncertainty created by the Russian invasion
of Ukraine.

**Sustainable Company in the Circular Economy**

Progroup’s products are shining examples of the circular economy. We only ever use recovered paper as the raw material
for our containerboard. The end product is also a recyclable product because at the end of its life the corrugated board is
largely processed through waste separation and reused throughout Europe. Our production processes also follow the
concept of a cycle: we produce energy from production residues and waste materials in our waste-to-energy plant in
Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany. Our water loops are closed on two of our three paper machines, and we recycle corrugated
board rejects back into the production cycle as a raw material used for papermaking.

The process of producing containerboard uses a lot of water. In our paper mills, we utilize water not only in the production
process, for example for breaking down recovered paper, but also for cooling and cleaning the facilities. To reduce the
level of consumption, we operate closed water cycles on two of our three paper machines (PM1 in Burg and PM3 in
Sandersdorf-Brehna). This means that there is no wastewater from production on these two machines, and on PM3 waste
water only comes from ancillary systems alongside the paper machine. These technologies are unique in our industry. This
has enabled us in recent years to significantly reduce the amount of fresh water we require for each ton of total output.
Compared to 2012, the reduction by 2021 was around 37% and by 2022 was around 34%. This slight increase in the specific
water consumption is attributable primarily to the increased amount of water used at our combined heat and power plant
compared to the previous year. By 2030, we aim to achieve a reduction in the specific amount of fresh water per ton of
total output by 40%.

Climate neutrality is a major challenge for Progroup, as it is for many other manufacturing companies. In Germany, the
paper industry is one of the three most energy-intensive industries. Although less energy is required for producing
recovered paper than for fresh fiber paper, our company is still to a large degree energy-dependent. The final drying of the
containerboard is done using steam, whose production consumes a lot of energy. In 2022, our total emissions were at
roughly the same level as the previous year despite our growth. We also continuously optimise our facilities. This allows
us to utilise steam and heating energy more efficiently. At the same time, the most effective lever at present for reducing
costs and emissions is to operate waste-to energy plants. Using substitute fuels also allows us to reduce the amount of gas
we use. By 2025 we want to reduce our specific emissions – relative to our Total Output of containerboard and corrugated
board sheets – by 35%. By 2030 the new power plant in Sandersdorf-Brehna should help us to achieve a saving of 40%.

**OUR STRATEGY**

**Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through**
**controlled investments**

To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe in the longterm and to allow us to successfully meet expected future market growth and the requirements of our customers with regard
to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand
and improve the efficiency of our production facilities as part of our long-term “Two Twentyfive” strategy, as long as
(i) we are confident we can achieve payback periods for our investments that are aligned with the maturity profile and
relevant headroom under our financing arrangements, (ii) we maintain sufficient financial flexibility to weather and/or
adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole, and (iii) any such investments would be consistent with


-----

our long-term target leverage. In addition to further capacity expansion, our “Two Twentyfive” strategy, among other
things, also contemplates a gradual technological transition and generation change away from the use of corrugators with
a trim width of 2.5m, which are installed and currently in use at some of our older corrugated board production sites, to the
use of more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our corrugated board production sites.

With the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up at our third and newest paper machine (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, we became a significant net seller of containerboard again. In the short- to mid-term, we
therefore intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production
capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market opportunities for profitable growth, similar to
those that led to the successful establishment of six new corrugated board plants (PW09, PW10, PW11, PW12, PW13 and
PW14) in Plössberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland), Drizzona (Italy), Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom), Eisfeld
(Germany) and Strykow (Poland) since 2015. We expect that (i) the start of commercial production in January 2023 and
the ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated
board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, (ii) the expected start of test production in the first half of 2024
and subsequent ramp-up at our proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, and (iii) our
further proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy alone will lead to a significant further increase
in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we expect to be operating again at the top end of our long-term target
corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board and again become a net purchaser of
containerboard in the mid-term. With the proposed additional corrugated board plants (PW15 and PW16) in Petersberg,
Germany and Cessalto, Italy, we expect our annual corrugated board production capacity to increase from currently
approximately 1,815,000 tons to approximately 2,215,000 tons.

In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we intend to achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion
opportunities via greenfield projects. However, as with our corrugated board production sites (PW03) in Burg, (PW05) in
Schüttorf, (PW06) in Offenbach a.d. Queich and (PW09) in Plössberg, Germany, our corrugated board production sites
(PW10) in Trzcinica and (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, our production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy and our production
site (PW12 ) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, we are also establishing our proposed new corrugated board production
site (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of
one of our customers, German packaging specialist G&G Preißer, allowing us to supply that long-standing partner largely
without freight and other freight expenses. Our latest corrugated board project (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy will also be
established in immediate vicinity to an existing packaging customer as a packaging park.

While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including in connection with the ten packaging park
projects (PW03, PW05, two packaging park customers at PW06, PW09, PW10, PW11, PW12, PW13 and PW14) and the
proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW15 and PW16) in Germany and Italy, we are also evaluating and will
continue to evaluate opportunities to find partners to leverage the benefits of a packaging park that would enrich our existing
network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our corrugated board production capacity and meet the
other internal investment and financing criteria described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our
relationships with certain large and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with
significant new customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated
board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers. We currently expect to make
total investments of approximately €246 million into the two proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW15 and
PW16) in Germany and Italy. With an expected combined annual incremental corrugated board production capacity for
PW15 and PW16 of approximately 400,000 tons of corrugated board, an average net selling price per ton of corrugated
board of €756.1 per ton in 2023 and historic EBITDA margins for Board in the high single digit to low double digit range,
we believe PW15 and PW16 to be able to make a sizable contribution to EBITDA following completion of both projects.
Historically, our new corrugated board production sites have typically achieved a capacity utilization level of around 90%
within 3 to 5 years of start of operation.

In the first quarter of 2023, we also started construction of a new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) next to PM3 in SandersdorfBrehna, to supply our newest paper machine with the required process steam as well as electricity. We currently expect to
make total investments of approximately €190 million, with a target completion date towards mid 2025.

**Maintain cost leadership through continuous efficiency and profitability improvements**

In order to maintain profitability throughout the economic cycle, we have been running a comprehensive profitability
improvement program for many years (the “Continuous Improvement Program”) to ensure the long-term success of our
Group. Our Continuous Improvement Program focuses on (i) improving the effectiveness of our sales and marketing
activities, (ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and (iii) stabilizing our specific fixed costs in order to achieve
sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost leaders in the recycled containerboard market. Since 2012,
our main focus in connection with our goal of achieving sales excellence has been on (i) growing our external sales in
excess of the general growth in market volumes (and thereby increasing our market share), (ii) maximizing the impact of
the introduction of our “next generation” products into the market and (iii) optimizing our sales portfolio. As part of our


-----

efforts to optimize our variable costs, we have focused on (i) reducing our consumption of raw materials, (ii) optimizing
our energy consumption and energy costs (including as a result of the expected cost savings owing to our new waste-toenergy plant (PPO2) next to PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna), and (iii) reducing the purchase prices of our key production
factors, such as recovered paper, starch and freight services. Overall, we have met or exceeded our targeted benefits through
our Continuous Improvement Program. We intend to continue to implement our Continuous Improvement Program and
identify and realize further improvement opportunities.

**HISTORY**

Our Group was founded in 1991, when Jürgen Heindl, our controlling shareholder and vice-chairman of our Supervisory
Board, established PROWELL Papierverarbeitung GmbH and launched our first plant (PW1) for the production of
corrugated board in Offenbach a. d. Queich, Germany, in the following year. From the beginning, we intended to focus on
the highly-efficient production of small batch sizes of sheet board for small and medium-sized customers based on high
technological standards. In 1996, a second corrugated board production site (PW2) was established in Douvrin, France,
and, in 1998, a third corrugated board production site (PW3) was launched in Burg, Germany.

Another key milestone in the development of our Group was the establishment of our first paper mill in Burg with our
paper machine PM1 for the production of medium- to heavy-weight containerboard with grammages of 100 to 230g/m[2].
At the time, PM1 introduced a number of new technological features, including a “2 gap former”, a “drum pulper”, a “speed
sizer” and a “closed-water loop” that minimizes the creation of waste water. PM1 represented a significant intermediate
step towards the high-speed production of lighter containerboard.

In 2002 and 2005, respectively, we further expanded our corrugated board capacity by launching our fourth and fifth
corrugated board production sites in Rokycany, Czech Republic (PW4) and in Schüttorf, Germany (PW5). The corrugators
at those two production sites have a width of 3.3 meters, which represented a new technology standard for the industry at
the time and resulted in significant productivity gains. In 2007, we established Europe’s largest corrugated board production
site in Offenbach a. d. Queich, Germany (PW6), replacing the original PW1 facility at the same site. In 2009, we realized
two further greenfield projects with the construction of our corrugated board production sites in Strykow, Poland (PW7)
and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW8).

Also in 2009, we commenced construction of our second paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt, Germany, with our paper machine
PM2 commencing production of super-light- to medium-weight containerboard in March 2010. To secure a portion of the
necessary funding for our €420 million investment in our paper machine PM2, we raised additional equity in 2008 and
2009, after Jürgen Heindl established JH-Holding, our controlling shareholder, in 2007. JH-Holding entered into a credit
facility and used a portion of the proceeds from its borrowings under that facility to subscribe for additional shares in the
Issuer. In addition, the Issuer issued preference shares to BWK GmbH Unternehmensbeteiligungsgesellschaft.

Around this time and in order to secure a reliable supply of energy to our paper machine PM2, we entered into certain
framework and ancillary agreements with Progroup Power 1 GmbH and its parent company Sales & Solutions GmbH
(formerly EnBW Energy Solutions GmbH) for the construction and operation of the waste-to-energy plant adjacent to our
paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt. The waste-to-energy plant commenced operation in 2011.

In July 2014, we announced a strategic investment in the construction of our corrugated board production site (PW09) in
Plössberg, Germany adjacent to and connected with a packaging plant of our customer Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk.
This site commenced production in October 2015. At our corrugated board productions sites in Burg, Offenbach, Schüttorf
and Ellesmere Port, some of our customers have established their own production sites in close proximity to, or even on,
our production sites. With our corrugated board production site (PW09) in Plössberg, Germany, we followed our customer
for the first time and set up our facility at the existing site of a customer.

Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we acquired the waste-to-energy plant adjacent to our paper mill in
Eisenhüttenstadt and certain related assets outright from EnBW Energie Baden-Württemberg AG. As a result, we started
producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves. The
completion of this acquisition constituted a significant milestone in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and allowed
us to significantly reduce our energy costs.

As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced production in the first quarter of 2017 at our corrugated
board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we purchased from our large customer Janmar Centrum adjacent
to its existing packaging plant.

Following the success of the two packaging park projects (PW09 and PW10) in Plössberg, Germany and in Trzcinica,
Poland, we also established our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy as a packaging park project in
immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of our customer, Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l. The


-----

commencement of production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018 also
marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe.

In 2018, we also achieved another milestone in our corporate history by implementing our new branding in order to further
strengthen our core brand “Progroup”, provide clearer focus and realize the full potential of the “Progroup” brand in the
markets where we operate in. The previous individual brands “Prowell”, “Propapier” and “Prologistik” were unified under
a single umbrella at the end of November 2018. Since then, we have operated under a single, uniform and strong Progroup
brand:

         - **Progroup refers to the centralized management and administration of the Group by Progroup AG, the**
Issuer, from our headquarters in Landau, Germany.

         - **Progroup Paper (formerly Propapier) encompasses our containerboard production activities at our three**
mills in Burg (PM1), Eisenhüttenstadt (PM2) and Sandersdorf-Brehna (PM3) (all located in Germany).

      - **Progroup Power (formerly Propower) includes the energy production of Power at the waste-to-energy**
plant adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt.

         - **Progroup Board (formerly Prowell) encompasses our corrugated board production at our twelve**
existing corrugated board plants in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United
Kingdom.

         - **Progroup Logistics (formerly Prologistik) encompasses our own logistics operations, including a fleet**
of trucks we operate primarily to service the business operations of Paper and Board.

To support this rebranding, we also changed the legal entity names of the various entities within our group in the fourth
quarter of 2018, except for Progroup AG and Prowell Verwaltungs GmbH.

Our corrugated board “mega plant” (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom commenced production in January 2019,
replacing our much smaller and now decommissioned corrugated board production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers
away from the new site. With an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than double
the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), the new production site made us a significant
player in the UK market and, we believe, positions us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we
have historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins.

Our corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with an annual corrugated board production capacity
of approximately 135,000 tons, started production in November 2019, further expanding our leading market position in
Germany.

The start of production in August 2020 of our third and newest paper machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany,
with an annual capacity of approximately 750,000 tons of containerboard, marked a further major milestone in our
corporate history. PM3 is not only one of the world’s most modern and high-performance paper machines for
manufacturing environmentally friendly and high-quality containboard, but also one of the world’s largest paper mills.

Similarly, our newest corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14), located right next to our earlier corrugated board plant (PW7)
in Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons, started
commercial production in January 2023, further strengthening our position as a leading player in the Polish market.

We are currently constructing yet another new corrugated board “mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany as another
packaging park project, right next door to our long-standing customer and partner G&G Preißer. The proposed plant has
an expected annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons and trial production is expected
to commence in the second quarter of 2024. We have further started construction of a new waste-to-energy plant (PPO2)
at the site of PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany to supply our paper machine PM3 with the required process heat as
well as electricity, and we have further already commenced construction of yet another corrugated board “mega plant”
(PW16) in Cessalto, Italy in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The following is a brief description of our core business units, Paper and Board.

**PAPER**

Paper encompasses our containerboard production at our three paper mills in Burg, Eisenhüttenstadt and SandersdorfBrehna, with a total annual production capacity of approximately 1,850,000 tons of containerboard. Our three paper
machines, PM1 in Burg, PM2 in Eisenhüttenstadt and PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna (all in Germany), are complementary


-----

to each other due to different production layouts and allow us to produce brown containerboard with grammages between
60 to 230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recovered paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently highquality containerboard with the appropriate widths for our corrugated board production sites. Since PM3 commenced
operation in August 2020, it has given us the ability to put an even stronger focus on the production of super-light-weight
containerboard (i.e., 70 to 80g/m[2]) at PM2 and to focus production at PM1 on specialty containerboard such as kraftliner
substitutes and containerboard with a higher grammages above 130g/m². PM3, on the other hand, is designed to provide
standard containerboard grades with grammages of 90 to 130g/m².

The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible containerboard production, with high output volumes to increase cost
efficiency and short delivery times. During 2023, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for approximately 76%, by
volume, of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board. Prior to the start of
production at PM3 in August 2020, as a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production capacity, we had
already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our longterm target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We believe that a high degree of
vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a costefficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. At the same time, we believe that the
high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or improve our overall Group margins by reducing our
exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared to corrugated board margins) of certain external containerboard
sales. Our customers also benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery, consistently
high quality as well as the possibility for online ordering and tracking options. The generally high-degree of vertical
integration between Paper and Board has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply chain.

With the start of production in August 2020 and subsequent ramp-up at PM3, with an annual capacity of approximately
750,000 tons of containerboard, the volume of our external containerboard sales significantly increased again. As a result,
internal containerboard sales to Board decreased to approximately 82% (or 92%, if we include containerboard sales to swap
partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2020, 75% (or 87%, if we include containerboard sales to
swap partners) in 2021 and approximately 75% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) in 2022. Due
to the further ramp-up of PM3, internal containerboard sales to Board as a percentage of total containerboard sales, by
volume, of Paper remained fairly stable at approximately 74% (or 85%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners)
in 2023. We expect that (i) the start of production in January 2023 and ongoing ramp-up of our newest corrugated board
“mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000
tons, (ii) the expected start of test production in the first half of 2024 and subsequent ramp-up at our proposed corrugated
board “mega plant” (PW15) in Petersberg, Germany, and (iii) our further proposed corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16)
in Cessalto, Italy alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we
expect to be operating again at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between
Paper and Board and again become a net purchaser of containerboard in the mid-term.

In 2023, our Paper operations generated €167.8 million in external sales, which represented 12.7% of our total sales. The
majority of these external containerboard sales were generated under one-year contracts with packaging customers. The
remainder of our external containerboard sales in 2023 was generated through spot market and multi-year supply
agreements. Our external containerboard customers include both other producers of corrugated board as well as commodity
traders. In 2023, our five largest Paper customers accounted for approximately 39% and our ten largest Paper customers
for approximately 57% of our external containerboard sales by volume.

**Paper Machine PM1**

Launched in 2001, our paper machine PM1 marked the start of the Group’s vertical integration into the production of
containerboard. With a trim width of 5.8 meters, it produces medium- to heavy-weight containerboard with grammages of
100 to 230g/m[2] using recycled fiber and, to a small extent, virgin fiber. We believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001,
PM1 was the world’s technologically most advanced containerboard paper machine, setting new technology standards,
including with the use of a closed water cycle, thereby minimizing the creation of waste water. Through a series of
investments and optimization measures since its launch, we have been able to significantly improve the annual capacity of
PM1 from under 300,000 tons of containerboard in 2001 to approximately 420,000 tons in 2023. In addition, since the
launch of our paper machine PM2, we further developed PM1 towards the production of heavier paper grades (i.e.,
grammages of 100 to 230g/m[2]), including testliner, kraftliner, proliner K, fluting paper and promedium S.

**Paper Machine PM2**

Launched in 2010, our paper machine, PM2, is calibrated to produce super-light- to medium-weight containerboard,
including testliner and fluting paper, with grammages of 60 to 130g/m[2] using almost exclusively recycled fiber. We believe
that PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machine based on trim width and designed speed as well as the
capability to produce super-lightweight containerboard grades. This allows us to set new industry standards with respect
to raw material efficiency, cost leadership as well as containerboard and corrugated board design. With its ability to produce


-----

super-light-weight paper grades, PM2 helps us to reduce consumption of recovered paper. For more information about our
range of “next generation” products, including next fibre[®] and next board[®], see “—Sustainability Focus; Research and
_Development” below. With a trim width of 10.2 meters, PM2 has an annual containerboard capacity of approximately_
680,000 tons, and since its launch in 2010, PM2 has set six new world records for production speed of various lightweight
paper grades. We believe that PM2 enables us to generate significant savings in fiber input, which is essential to our ability
to improve our competitive position and future profitability.

**Paper Machine PM3**

Furthermore, in order to preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient
and highly flexible manner in sufficient quantities to meet the majority of the sourcing requirements of the expanding
corrugated board production within Board, we established our third and newest paper machine (PM3) in SandersdorfBrehna, Germany. The state-of-the-art paper machine commenced production in August 2020, with a total annual
containerboard capacity of approximately 750,000 tons, increasing the total annual containerboard capacity of Paper from
approximately 1,100,000 tons to approximately 1,850,000 tons. PM3 has a 9.2m trim width, which allows us to optimize
containerboard production to meet the requirements of the more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at
most of our newer corrugated board production sites, which we believe has already resulted in lower volumes of cutting
scrap and higher productivity. As described above, the establishment of PM3 has further enhanced the productivity of all
our paper machines as each paper mill is now able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. PM3 is not only one of the
world’s most modern and high-performance paper machines for manufacturing environmentally friendly and high-quality
containerboard, but also one of the world’s largest paper mills.

**BOARD**

Board encompasses our production of high-quality corrugated board at our twelve corrugated board plants in the Czech
Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a total annual production capacity of
approximately 1,815,000 tons of corrugated board, including approximately 200,000 of annual production capacity of our
latest corrugated board plant (PW14) in Strykov, which commenced commercial production in January 2023.

More than 46% of our current total corrugated board production capacity is located in Germany where we have a total
annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 750,000 tons at five different production sites (PW03,
PW05, PW06, PW09 and PW13). We are currently constructing yet another corrugated board plant (PW15) in Petersberg,
Germany, with test production expected to commence in the first half of 2024. This proposed new corrugated board
production site is expected to add a further annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 200,000 tons to
our corrugated board production capacity in Germany. Our German corrugated board production sites primarily serve the
German market.

Our production site (PW2) in Douvrin, France, has an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately
80,000 tons and primarily serves markets in France and in the Benelux countries.

Our plants in Rokycany, Czech Republic, Strykow and Trzcinica, Poland are well-positioned to serve Eastern European
markets. Our Rokycany site (PW4) has an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 140,000 tons and
our Polish sites in Strykow (PW7 and PW14) and Trzcinica (PW10) have an annual corrugated board production capacity
of approximately 175,000, 200,000 and 135,000 tons, respectively.

The production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy commenced in early March 2018, with
an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 135,000 tons. The establishment of this site marked our
entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. We plan to further expand our presence in this important
market and have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board “mega plant” (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy in
October 2023. This latest corrugated board production site is expected to have an annual corrugated board production
capacity of approximately 200,000 tons.

With the commencement of production in January 2019 and subsequent ramp-up at our corrugated board “mega plant”
(PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, which replaced our much smaller and now decommissioned corrugated board
production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers away from the new site, we have now also become a significant player
in the UK market. The new production site operates with a 3.35m trim width and has an annual corrugated board production
capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site
(PW8), which we established in 2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width.

Since the establishment of our Group, we have planned and developed our production sites primarily as greenfield projects
and, more recently, as packaging park projects to ensure the optimal geographic location as well as a high technological
standard for each site. Our Board operations focus on the efficient and flexible production of customized small batch series,
with a high degree of automation at all our production sites, both with respect to the production process itself as well as


-----

order handling. We believe we offer significant added value to our customers by offering fully automated online ordering,
reliable and just-in-time delivery within 24 hours for selected products and online order tracking options. For more
information, see “—Information Technology and Process Management”.

Our range of Board corrugated board products includes all customary single-wall, double-wall and triple-wall flutes, and
we have devoted significant time and efforts to developing a range of “next generation” products which feature reduced
raw material consumption while maintaining or even improving technical specifications. For more information about these
products, including next board[®] and next box[®], see “—Sustainability Focus; Research and Development”.

In 2023, our Board operations generated €1,136.7 million in sales or 86.1% of our total sales in 2023. We have established
a strong and long-standing customer base, with some of our customer relationships dating back to the beginning of our
operations in 1992. We have grown with our large German customers and have also successfully entered into new
relationships with key customers outside of Germany. Today we supply 350 to 400 different Board customers. In 2023,
our five largest Board customers accounted for approximately 22% and our ten largest Board customers for approximately
31% of our corrugated board sales by volume. The same year, our largest single customer generated approximately 6% of
our total corrugated board sales by volume.

We have established long-term strategic business relationships with many of our largest corrugated board customers. We
believe that our ability to provide reliable delivery of high-quality, cost-effective and tailor-made products and being a
family-owned business have enabled us to foster strong partnerships of mutual dependence with our mostly family-owned
customers, operating as a fundamental part of their supply chains by improving inventory management, security of supply
and customer service. However, consistent with industry practice, our business relationships are not governed by long-term
agreements with fixed prices and sales volumes.

We believe that our differentiated business model is particularly beneficial for many of our small to medium-sized
customers with a decentralized production. For some of our larger customers that purchase a high percentage (typically
70% or more) of their corrugated board requirements from us, we offer predictable pricing for our corrugated board
products through index pricing arrangements. In addition, at some of our corrugated board production sites, certain
long-standing customers have established their own box manufacturing plants in immediate proximity to our site, either on
our own land or on land adjacent to our site (so-called “packaging park”). As a variation of this traditional packaging park
model, we commenced production in October 2015 at our corrugated board production site (PW09) in Plössberg, Germany,
which we established in immediate proximity to an existing packaging plant of our customer, Liebensteiner
Kartonagenwerk, on land owned by our customer. As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced
production in the first quarter of 2017 at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we
purchased from our large customer Janmar Centrum adjacent to its existing packaging plant. Following the success of these
two packaging park projects (PW09 and PW10), we also established our corrugated board production site (PW11) in
Drizzona, Italy as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of our customer, Italian
packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l.. Similarly, our proposed further corrugated board plant (PW15) in Petersberg,
Germany, will be located right next door to our long-standing customer and partner G&G Preißer. The next corrugated
board plant (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy, which is expected to commence test production in 2025, is being built next door to
our customer Ondulkart. All versions of the packaging park model help us to further strengthen our relationships with key
customers and benefit both us and the relevant customers. The high level of integration between our own corrugated board
production and the box production of our customers also made possible through the packaging park model creates a number
of efficiencies and largely eliminates freight and other freight expenses between Board and our packaging park customers.
Our packaging park customers also typically purchase almost all of their corrugated board requirements for the relevant
box plant from us, which ensures predictable, high volume orders and consistently high utilization levels for the relevant
corrugated board production sites. To further ensure a predictable pricing mechanism for all parties, we also typically have
index pricing arrangements with our packaging park customers.

In 2023, approximately 31% of our total volume sales by surface area were generated under index pricing arrangements
with our customers. The prices under these arrangements are linked to a containerboard market price index. Although these
arrangements generally do not involve minimum sales volumes, demand levels are typically stable and we are in regular
contact with our customers to ensure we have reasonable visibility over sales volumes for the following year. In addition,
approximately 23% of our volume sales by surface area in 2023 were attributable to packaging park customers. Customers
accounting for approximately 79% of our volume sales by surface area in 2023 submitted their orders electronically and
communicated directly with our IT systems via e-box, which offers those customers certain benefits in terms of order
processing and tracking. It typically takes approximately two to three months for containerboard mills to pass on their raw
material price increases to their customers, i.e., manufacturers of corrugated board. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated
board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to
three months for corrugated board manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases on to the respective customers.

**PROCUREMENT/PURCHASING**

**Overview**

Our most important purchasing items include recovered paper, containerboard, energy and freight, which collectively
account for the majority of our total procurement expenses (i.e., cost of materials and other operating expenses as presented
in the Consolidated Income Statement).

Most of our procurement and purchasing activities are concentrated in centralized purchasing organizations at our
headquarters in Landau, which are responsible for purchasing containerboard, freight services, energy, “technical”
purchases, including starch, chemicals, maintenance services and other technical supplies as well as other supplies. The
local purchasing departments in our three paper mills in Burg, Eisenhüttenstadt and Sandersdorf-Brehna are integrated in
the central purchasing department. An additional local purchasing department at our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt also
centrally handles all purchases of recovered paper for the Group as well as the purchase of refuse derived fuel for the wasteto-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt. By centralizing many of our purchasing activities, we aim to maximize our purchasing
power, while at the same time building a high degree of expertise. The markets and prices for the most important production
costs in our business, such as containerboard, energy and recovered paper, are driven by international supply and demand
and require Group-wide purchasing strategies in order to optimize results. Our strategies include a mixture of mid-term
supply contracts and spot purchasing of raw materials.

The main raw material for the production of containerboard is recovered paper. As described above, all recovered paper
for the Group is purchased centrally by our local purchasing department at our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt. In 2022 and
2023, Paper purchased a total of approximately 1,740,000 tons and 1,771,000 tons, respectively, of recovered paper from
a broad portfolio of more than 60 suppliers. Prices for recovered paper have been highly volatile in the past. By improving
our supplier portfolio management, we have been able to improve our average purchasing conditions in recent years. In
making our purchasing decisions with respect to recovered paper, we can choose from a wide variety of suppliers. For the
bulk recovered paper grades B12 and B19, we have entered into long-term supply agreements with a volume of 1,010,000
tons, which we expect to cover effectively all our related requirements. We purchase approximately 9% of our total
recovered paper requirements under fixed volume contracts with a term of between one and four years and either fixed
prices or index-linked prices. For approximately 33% of our total recovered paper purchases, we renegotiate prices on a
monthly basis. Approximately 66% of our recovered paper purchases involve prices linked to relevant indices, such as
Euwid or indices published by the German Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt).

The main input cost for our production of corrugated board is containerboard. In 2022 and 2023, Board purchased
approximately 1,508,000 tons and 1,570,000 tons, respectively, of containerboard. In both years, approximately 76% were
supplied internally by Paper. The remainder was purchased from a portfolio of approximately 30 external containerboard
suppliers. External purchases of containerboard primarily involved purchases of kraftliner and white testliner. To reduce
transportation costs for shipments of containerboard from our paper mills to our corrugated board production sites, we also
enter into swap agreements with other containerboard producers from time to time. By maintaining a high share of
internally sourced containerboard, we can ensure a consistently high quality of the containerboard we use, which has a
positive impact on the operational performance of the equipment we use in our corrugated board production processes. In
addition, our own containerboard production capabilities at Paper allow us to cater to the specific needs of our corrugated
board production at Board.

**Energy**

The production of containerboard is very energy intensive. The operation of our three paper mills accounted for 91% of
the total energy consumption of all our production sites (i.e., not including energy consumption of our headquarters in
Landau) in 2023, and the operation of our twelve existing corrugated board plants at that time together with our existing
waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt accounted for the remainder. Electricity and steam are the primary forms of
energy required for our production operations.

The sharp rise in energy prices in 2022 has further increased the importance of managing our energy costs as our past
efforts to reduce energy costs per production unit were more than offset by the sharp rise in energy prices in 2022. As a
result of our hedging strategy, we were only affected by a small proportion of the energy price increases in 2022. Energy
prices fell significantly in 2023, and we were also able to benefit from these decreases in energy prices, as our hedge levels
for 2023 were comparatively low. Notwithstanding increases in production volumes and the implications from the very
volatile recent energy price development, our energy consumption per ton of output has decreased for a variety of reasons,
including (i) our efforts to reduce energy consumption, (ii) the optimization of our energy procurement processes, (iii) the
optimization of the refuse derived fuel consumption as well as the operating costs of our existing waste-to-energy plant in
Eisenhüttenstadt, and (iv) the full utilization of all available accommodations, credits and refunds under applicable energy
laws and regulations. For more information about our energy management efforts, see “—Sustainability Focus; Research
_and Development”._


-----

In addition, our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt ensures a reliable, long-term supply of steam to PM2
which is independent of fossil fuels such as gas, oil or coal. This independence from fossil fuels in particular has proven to
be very valuable during the energy crisis of 2022. While other forms of steam and electricity generation were severely
affected by fluctuations in energy prices, our waste-to-energy power plant in Eisenhüttenstadt ensured an independent and
price-stable energy supply to PM2. As a back-up solution for the supply of steam in case of a maintenance or other
shutdown of the waste-to-energy plant, a nearby power plant in Eisenhüttenstadt can also supply steam to the PM2. Based
on these advantages, we have decided to build another waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) at the site of our newest paper machine
PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna. We expect that this proposed waste-to-energy plant (PPO2) will supply PM3 with the majority
of its annual steam requirements from mid-2025 and that it will also generate around 40% of the electricity required by
PM3. Other energy supply agreements we enter into typically have a maximum term of two years. For larger energy
procurement quantities, we may make use of tranche models to contract for annual volumes at different times, for different
tranches and prices of our total energy requirements and for different periods. This allows us to maintain a maximum
amount of flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.

**Freight/Logistics**

At each step of our internal value chain and production processes, we coordinate and monitor complex logistical processes
to ensure the efficient flow of materials and products. This includes the shipment of large rolls of containerboard from our
three paper mills in Germany to our twelve existing corrugated board plants in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy,
Poland and the United Kingdom as well as the shipment of our finished corrugated board to our customers in the packaging
industry (box plants).

We meet our freight and logistics requirements mainly through the use of external logistics companies and, to a much lesser
extent, our own fleet of currently 59 trucks. Due to the relatively large size and weight of our products compared to value,
freight and logistics expenses play an important role in the profitability of our business. The selection and commissioning
of our external logistics partners is centrally organized by our logistics department in Landau, supported by our logistics
specialists at Logistics in Burg.

The support of our own team of logistics specialists at Logistics also provides us with real-time insight into the latest
developments in the market for transportation services, which allows us to strategically employ the use of our own fleet of
trucks. In addition, our own fleet gives us the ability to cover temporary capacity constraints in the market. Other targeted
optimization measures which have resulted in a reduction of related transportation costs include (i) the development of
specialized transport cradles for our containerboard rolls, which allow for a more efficient use of the cargo hold of each
truck, (ii) the hiring of trucks with cargo holds best suited for our transportation needs, (iii) improved journey planning and
(iv) better coordination of loading and offloading times.

**SALES AND MARKETING**

Our sales team is tasked with achieving the sales, margin and volume targets defined by our management. A central element
of our sales efforts is the provision of strong customer support for our existing customer base and the establishment and
maintenance of strong relationships with purchasing managers and other key decision makers within our customers’
organizations. Other key elements of our sales efforts involve winning new customers, especially in new markets, and the
introduction of new products.

To ensure we meet the targets defined by our management, we have implemented a sales management system within our
sales organization that is designed to monitor our performance against our volume targets. In addition, we have
implemented a centralized pricing system to ensure a proper framework for achieving our sales and margin targets.

Our marketing team supports our sales team and provides it with market-focused concepts and a full set of marketing tools.
In addition to supporting the Group-wide targets defined by our management, our marketing efforts are also aimed at
further strengthening our product brands (e.g., Progroup Paper, Progroup Board, Progroup Logistics, next fibre[®], next
board[®] and next box[®]) and maximizing their value.

A key condition for a consistent brand image is the presentation of a clear and consistent external appearance, which we
try to ensure through a full package of coordinated marketing tools and marketing activities. We believe this also benefits
our packaging customers, as it can help support their own product marketing with their end-customers.

In 2023, our sales and marketing teams employed an average of 35 full-time employees (34 in 2022).

**INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT**

As described above, we principally generate revenue through the sale of containerboard and corrugated board. Our mills
primarily sell the containerboard we produce to Group-owned converting operations and we sell our corrugated board to


-----

our third-party customers in the packaging industry. The operation of our plants as well as our sales and service activities
depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex and sophisticated computer, telecommunication and data
processing systems.

Our value chain starts with recovered paper, which is the primary raw material in the production of containerboard. In
managing our supply of raw materials, we need to constantly monitor our internal needs for containerboard, which we
primarily meet through our own mills in Burg, Eisenhüttenstadt and Sandersdorf-Brehna as well as, to a much more limited
extent, third-party containerboard producers.

Between each of the further steps along the value chain and our production process, we need to coordinate and monitor
complex logistical processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and products. This includes the shipment of large
rolls of containerboard from our mills to our twelve corrugated board plants at our eleven other corrugated board sites in
the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom as well as the shipment of our finished
corrugated board to our customers in the packaging industry (box plants).

Our corrugated board plants process up to approximately 4,850 individual customer orders for corrugated board each day
with a total volume of approximately 12 million square meters. At each plant, we prepare and load up to 90 truckloads of
corrugated board every day.

Our IT infrastructure needs to be able to support all these processes, including by helping us to optimize:

  - our use of raw materials (raw material management);

  - our production planning and production control (minimization of cutting scrap);

  - our warehouse management for both raw materials and finished products; and

  - the coordination of loading and offloading times.

In 2023, approximately 80% of purchase orders for corrugated board from our Board customers were received
electronically (71% in 2022), and all material core processes, which need to be coordinated and timed efficiently to ensure
the smooth and efficient operation of our production processes, are being controlled by our central WEPAFORM-server
and by local WEPAFORM servers at each plant.

WEPAFORM is our proprietary core ERP system we use across the Group and which implements our internal know-how
in the form of best practices and rules of conduct. The functionality of WEPAFORM covers the main of our core processes,
including order processing, raw materials planning, production planning, production control as well as shipment and
warehousing. WEPAFORM implements both the rules of conduct of our individual departments as well as those rules of
conduct that apply Group-wide, which supports the implementation of our Group-wide business strategies.

For example, in response to a requested delivery date in a customer purchase order, we try to automate, as much as possible,
the confirmation of the actual delivery date for products covered by the relevant order. This actual delivery date will be
determined based on a combination of factors, such as optimal transportation planning (including with regard to load
capacity, offloading times and punctuality) as well as optimal production planning (i.e., feasibility and minimization of
cutting scrap). This determination, in turn, will take account of all other pending orders at the time as well as the availability
of freight options. All these complex determinations are controlled and automated through WEPAFORM.

While WEPAFORM is used only internally for the processes mentioned above, for all other business processes, we use a
whole range of standard software systems (Commercial off-the-shelf, COTS), which are tailored to our needs by
configuration. Such systems include, among others, applications for payroll processing (SAP SuccessFactors since 2024),
time management (Atoss Staff Efficiency Suite), equipment maintenance (MAXIMO), transport management for Logistics
(Carlo) and professional project management (Planview Portfolios). As a part of our transformation project in our finance
department between 2020 and 2022, we established new best practice standard-processes for our finance department on
the basis of end-to-end designs and newly set up SAP S/4HANA system.

In 2022, we also introduced the Procon integration platform, which is based on Mulesoft’s Anypoint Platform. Procon
increasingly manages all interfaces between applications both at the individual locations (plants) and at head office, thus
contributing to standardization and effective log management. Since 2023, we have been operating an OpenAPI platform
that also provides access to our systems for customers and suppliers. Progroup Web Services (PWS), which is based on a
modern microservices architecture, was also launched in 2023. Similar to Amazon’s AWS, the platform offers new
possibilities for connecting applications.


-----

All of the aforementioned technologies together are based on open, globally used standards that enable fast response times
and a quick and easy type of integration.

To support the various software applications we use within the Group, we operate our own data centers at our plants. The
outsourcing of the data center operations to Deutsche Telekom as a managed service in 2023 was implemented to enhance
availability. Through the utilization of geo-redundant data centers of Deutsche Telekom and the deployment of the
professional service (Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS), potential outages can be avoided and risks minimized. Additionally,
all sites are interconnected via a so-called SD-WAN network, which also brings positive effects on the availability of the
locations. At our site in Burg, Germany, we operate a local area network (LAN) which connects our local containerboard
(Board), corrugated board (Paper) and logistics operations (Logistics) and which, in turn, is connected to our main data
center via leased MPLS lines. To reduce the risk of a disruption of individual Internet connections between our various
facilities and our main data center, we maintain alternative backup Internet routes for each facility. Additionally, to ensure
business continuity on application level for our core production processes, to successfully manage potential network issues,
we operate WEPAFORM manufacturing execution processes as edge datacenters in our plants. To host our software
applications, we use ESX-Server farm based on NETAPP Storage systems. Relevant software applications are made
available remotely to all users with the Progroup network via CITRIX XenApp.

In 2023, our IT department employed an average of 51 employees (47 in 2022), including management positions, team
leaders, administrative assistants and software developers. In addition, we worked with external IT consultants and, with
regard to the non-proprietary applications we use, cooperated with the relevant software developers and their partners.
Given the strong reliance of our business on information technology, the success of our business depends on our continuing
ability to attract and retain qualified IT personnel in the long-term, which has been challenging in the past given an
increasing shortage of qualified personnel, especially in Germany. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry
_and Our Business—The success of our business relies on certain key personnel, and our ability to attract and retain key_
_personnel, other qualified management personnel and skilled workers”._

**SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**

As we believe that a circular economy is key to a sustainable future, we have started to publish an annual sustainability
report in 2021 to share our understanding of sustainability, our initiatives as well as our sustainability goals with our
stakeholders, clients and employees. As a manufacturer of recyclable products, we are part of the circular economy that
conserves resources. Our containterboard is made from recovered paper, a secondary raw material, and the end products
made from our corrugated board can usually be recycled.

Accepting ecological, economic and social responsibility has always been part of our identity as a family-owned business,
and promoting the sustainability of our core businesses, i.e., the production of containerboard and corrugated board, has
been a key priority for our Group, not only from an environmental perspective, but also as a matter of pure economic
necessity. Containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer, and this standardization has led to intensified
price competition within our industry. In addition, our operating results are significantly impacted by the containerboard
and corrugated board industry’s cyclical pattern, with periods of overcapacity and resulting pressure on the pricing of our
products. These pressures can be further exacerbated by significant volatility in our key input costs, in particular the cost
of recovered paper, energy costs and freight expenses.

As a result, we are forced to continuously optimize the utilization of our assets and explore new ways to further reduce our
input costs and therefore optimize our cost structure. In practice, this means that we continuously strive to further reduce
the use of fiber (i.e., recovered paper) in our products as well as the amount of energy required for our production processes
and the shipment of our products, which helps us both to maintain a cost leadership position within our industry (with the
goal of safeguarding our profit margins) and to help the environment by reducing our CO2 footprint.

As a result of the factors described above, we believe there are general “mega trends” towards lighter and more functional
packaging and towards a more efficient use of resources. The trend towards “light paper” (i.e., containerboard) has been
particularly strong in Germany and has been further strengthened by high growth rates in e-commerce, which have led to
an increase in demand for light and safe packaging solutions.

We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in Eisenhüttenstadt,
Germany (PM2), which specializes in the production of super-light- to medium-weight containerboard with grammages of
60 to 130g/m[2]. With regard to the production of super-light-weight containerboard (with a grammage below 90g/m[2]), which
is particularly sought after in the market, we believe that our paper machine PM2 gives us a significant advantage over
many of our competitors, both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Based on a study by Vision Hunters, we believe
PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machine for recycled super-light-weight paper and has set six new world
records since its launch in 2010. Our subsidiary Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, which operates our paper mill in
Eisenhüttenstadt, is certified under the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (“EMAS”), a voluntary scheme set up by the
European Union that is designed to help companies to continuously improve their environmental performance. The EMAS


-----

certification of Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH also carries several advantages for our business. Among other advantages, it
(i) results in simplified reporting obligations under the German Federal Emission Law (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz,
“BImSchG”), and (ii) generally improves our corporate image as an “eco-friendly” company. The current EMAS
certification for our mill in Eisenhüttenstadt and Power is valid until July 4, 2026 and July 4, 2026, respectively.

To support the EMAS certification of Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH and Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH as well as the ISO
50001 and ISO 14001 certifications of Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH and to generally improve our energy management, we
have implemented energy management systems (“EnMS”) at our paper mills in Burg, Eisenhüttenstadt and SandersdorfBrehna, the operation of which is particularly energy intensive, as well as all of our corrugated board production sites. In
addition to the advantages described above, the implementation of EnMS at our various sites also has the following benefits
for our business: (i) it helps us monitor compliance with applicable environmental regulations, (ii) it increases the
transparency of our internal production processes, (iii) it enables a clear allocation of internal responsibilities and tasks,
(iv) it serves as the basis for potential efficiency improvements by helping us identify potential cost savings and to reduce
emissions, and (v) it reduces the risk of potential environmental liability. The containerboard produced by our three paper
mills is also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).

At our paper mill in Sandersdorf-Brehna (PM3) we reduced our fresh water consumption down to 1.2 m[3]/t and have
installed a closed cycle water treatment system with biogas production that generates up to 7 to 8% of the overall gas
consumption of the paper machine. In addition, we spent significant time, expense and effort developing a “green” range
of “next generation” products working in a close cooperation with BHS Corrugated GmbH, one of our equipment suppliers,
and a team of researchers at the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften) in
Regensburg, Germany, over a period of several years. We market the resulting products under our own brands next fibre[®],
next board[®] and next box[®]. All these product innovations involve the use of the super-light-weight containerboard produced
by our paper machine PM2 as well as innovative flute designs/corrugated board formats.

Next fibre[®] is the brand under which we market a new generation of super-light-weight containerboard produced by our
paper machine PM2. Our goal in developing this new generation of containerboard was to minimize the amount of fiber
and energy used in its production, while at the same time maximizing its performance. The result of our efforts is a much
lighter containerboard with consistently high paper homogeneity and a much optimized production process in terms of
energy consumption, repulping and moisture monitoring. In addition, TÜV Rheinland, an independent German standards
organization, certified reductions in the CO2 footprint for our next fibre[®] containerboard. In addition, next fibre[®]

containerboard features significantly more roll weight running meters per containerboard roll during transport as a result
of the reduced weight, resulting in further reductions in CO2 emissions.

Next board[®] is the brand under which we market our new generation of corrugated board products produced with our next
fibre[®] containerboard. Due to a combination of the use of the lighter containerboard and innovative and improved flute
designs and general board architecture, this range of corrugated boards is not only lighter than conventional corrugated
board, but also offers our customers better performance characteristics, a better surface and printability, lower freight
expenses and a better life-cycle assessment. Next board[®] products feature up to 5% reduction in CO2 emissions during
transport and up to 16% increase in the loadable corrugated board surface area, meaning that approximately one in every
seven truck journey can potentially be avoided, as certified by TÜV Rheinland.

Next box[®] is a label we make available to our packaging customers, which they can use for eco-friendly and sustainable
packaging produced with our next board[®] corrugated board products. Next board[®] corrugated board allows for more exact
processing compared to comparable conventional corrugated board, as well as more reliable machinability and higher
running rates. Next box[®] packaging features a smooth look without any ripple effect and permits optimal printing results
due to our improved corrugated board designs. In addition, next box[®] products allow for more efficient storage and reduce
transportation costs due to the reduced raw material content. We believe that sustainability and eco-friendliness are of
increasing importance to our customers, especially in Germany. To allow our customers in the packaging industry as well
as their end customers to highlight their own commitment to sustainability, we therefore make our next box[®]—reduced
CO2 label available to them, which can be stamped on all next box[®] packaging.

**EMPLOYEES**

In 2023 we employed an average of 1,719 employees (excluding trainees) in six countries (1,623 for the year ended
December 31, 2022). Approximately 75% of our employees are employed at our headquarters in Landau, Germany, and at
our production sites in Germany. As of December 31, 2023, we had 433 employees outside of Germany, including 180
employees in Poland, 69 employees in the Czech Republic, 68 employees in Italy, 68 employees in the United Kingdom
and 48 employees in France.

Our workforce is characterized by normal fluctuation levels, and the average job tenure of our employees across all our
sites is 7.9 years. As a result of our continuous hiring strategy and long-standing training programs, we believe our
workforce currently has a well-balanced age structure. As of December 31, 2023, we had 66 trainees.


-----

With the exception of our employees in France and at Progroup Power 1 GmbH, our workforce is not subject to any
collective bargaining agreements and there are no works councils. In accordance with the French Works Constitution Act,
a works council represents our employees at our corrugated board production site in Douvrin, France. At Progroup Power
1 GmbH our employees are also represented by a works council.

**INSURANCE**

We maintain various insurance policies for different aspects of our business. These policies are centrally managed by our
legal and insurance department in Landau, with the support of our insurance broker S&P Schulz & Partner GmbH,
Mannheim. Our insurance coverage includes all-risk policies insuring against property destruction, damage and loss, as
well as against any business interruption directly resulting from any property damage. In addition, we maintain liability
insurance coverage with regard to general operating liability, radiation liability and environmental liability, as well as
transport and accident insurance. We obtain insurance coverage for particular risks based on an internal risk analysis. We
believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage commensurate with our business and production volumes and in line
with industry practice, with deductibles and coverage limits that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate. We
continuously re-evaluate the appropriateness of our insurance coverage in the ordinary course. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will not suffer losses that may either not be covered by insurance or that may exceed the coverage amount
under the relevant insurance policies. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Business— Operational
_disruptions at our facilities, in particular our three mills, could have a material adverse effect on our margins, results of_
_operations and financial condition”._

**REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT**

Our business, and in particular the operation of our production sites, is subject to various regulatory requirements.
Applicable laws and regulations may differ from site to site due to different national and local laws. The regulatory
requirements relate in particular to our production processes and include, inter alia, laws and regulations relating to health
and safety measures for employees, the technical safety requirements for operating machines, the use and handling of
chemicals, air and water emissions, soil contamination and the management and disposal of waste, hazardous and toxic
substances and other materials. For our sites and operations, we are required to obtain and hold various permits and to
comply with the requirements specified therein. We are further subject to foreign trade laws and may be required to pay
export duties or customs duties on materials and products that we export and import. We are subject to further regulations
in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including antitrust laws and zoning and occupancy laws that generally
apply to manufacturing businesses and/or govern the promotion and sale of the products we offer, the operation of our
facilities and our relationships with customers, suppliers and competitors. The following is an overview of the main laws
and regulations that are relevant to our activities in Germany. Local laws and regulations that deal with similar aspects
apply in other jurisdictions in which we operate production sites or sell our products.

**Environmental Laws**

We are required to comply with various environmental laws and regulations. In particular, our operations are subject to
laws and regulations designed to limit emissions. In Germany, the construction and operation of our paper mills requires
active permits under the Federal Emissions Protection Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, “BImSchG”), which
encompasses various approvals necessary for the construction and operation of facilities pursuant to other laws, including
public-law approvals, registrations and consents. The operation of the relevant facility can generally not be challenged or
contested by third parties as long as the respective facility operates in compliance with its permit. In such cases, third
parties can only require certain measures to mitigate any negative impact of a facility on the environment. To the extent
such measures are impossible or uneconomical to implement based on state-of-the-art technology, the relevant third parties
may only claim damages. Permits and additional administrative orders under the Federal Emissions Protection Act may
impose certain limitations (e.g., stricter requirements with regard to permissible emissions or the use of the relevant
facilities), with which we have to comply. To the extent new legal standards are introduced, permits will not be
grandfathered but adjusted so they meet the relevant new standards. A violation of the operator’s duties as determined in
the respective permit (or an additional administrative order) or a modification of the relevant legal standards may also lead
to a restriction or, in severe cases, a prohibition of the further operation of the facility and/or the revocation of its permit
under certain circumstances. The competent authority may also impose administrative fines or even ask for removal of the
facility. In addition to our obligations under the BImSchG, we are required to observe the requirements under the Technical
Instructions on Air Quality Control (Technische Anleitung Luft – “TA Luft”), a revised version of which entered into force
on December 1, 2021.

Moreover, the operation of our three paper mills is subject to the various duties of the Federal Water Management Act
(Wasserhaushaltsgesetz, “WHG”), the State Water Acts in each of the German states (Landeswassergesetze) and the
respective federal and/or state ordinances (Rechtsverordnungen). These regulations govern our use of water during
production. According to the Federal Water Management Act, as well as the corresponding State (Länder) laws, the use of
water generally requires the approval by the competent authority. In particular, the extraction of above-ground water, the


-----

discharge of waste water and the pouring and discharge of materials are all aspects of our containerboard production that
require regulatory approval. In cases of violations of the relevant provisions, we may be required to pay damages or become
subject to penalties. Depending on the type of permit, it may be limited in time and it may either be revoked any time or
only under certain circumstances.

Our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt also requires various regulatory approvals for its operation,
particularly under the BImSchG and the 17[th] Ordinance to the BImSchG on the incineration and co-incineration of waste
(17. Verordnung zum BImSchG, “17. BImSchV”). Furthermore, operations have to comply with the applicable greenhouse
gas emissions caps. See “—Regulation governing the Operation of Waste-to-Energy Plant—Environmental laws and other
_related laws and regulations” and “—Regulation governing the Operation of Waste-to-Energy Plant—Carbon Emission_
_compliance” below._

Our three paper mills are subject to the German Radiation Protection Ordinance (Strahlenschutzverordnung, “StrlSchV”)
due to the fact that our paper machines include various measuring devices (e.g., for measuring paper basis weights, paper
moisture and/or paper ash) that rely on the use of a number of slightly radioactive isotopes (i.e., Cobalt60, Krypton85,
Cesium137 and/or Iron55). The use of these materials and devices is common in the paper industry as well as in other
industries. They are applied in enclosed form, _i.e., isotopes are enclosed by a protective cover to avoid any release of_
radiation. When the isotopes are not in use, they are further shielded with steel plates. According to Sec. 7 of the Radiation
Protection Ordinance, the handling of the relevant radioactive isotopes requires permits, which we have obtained. Even if
these permits would be revoked, however, we would be able to switch to using different measuring devices based on
different technologies. We also maintain insurance coverage for liability resulting from radiation.

**Waste Legislation and Regulations**

The use of waste (as a substitute fuel within Power’s existing waste-to-energy plant) is subject to European and German
waste legislation. Among others, the German Act on the Federal Waste Management Act (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz,
“KrWG”) and corresponding regulation, such as the Packaging Act (Verpackungsgesetz, “VerpackG”) and the List of
Wastes Ordinance (Abfallverzeichnisverordnung, “AVV”), stipulate certain standards and requirements. Apart from that,
the use of waste containing Hexabromcyclododecan (“HBCD”), which is, inter alia, contained in insulation boards that in
the past have been used as a substitute fuel within our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt, was subject to
usage restrictions and additional documentation requirements under the Regulation (EC) No. 850/2004 on persistent
organic pollutants (“POP Regulation”). Power has held meetings with its suppliers to resolve potential issues in this
respect.

**Chemicals Legislation and Regulations**

We use a number of chemicals in our production processes and are therefore subject to Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006
concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”). The aim of REACH is
to improve the protection of human health and the environment through better and earlier identification of the intrinsic
properties of chemical substances. REACH places greater responsibility on industry participants to manage the risks from
chemicals and to provide safety information on the substances. As a “downstream user” pursuant to REACH, we are
primarily required to adhere to the recommended risk reduction measures, to forward our customers and suppliers the
relevant information and, if necessary, to arrange for a chemical safety report to be prepared.

In addition, we are subject to the provisions of the German Chemicals Act (Gesetz zum Schutz vor gefährlichen Stoffen—
_Chemikaliengesetz, “ChemG”) and related ordinances (Rechtsverordnungen). The ChemG is intended to minimize the_
risks from chemicals for humans and the environment. Based on the ChemG and related regulations, the competent
authorities have the power to—among others—require that certain materials or chemicals (i) may either not be produced,
marketed or used at all, (ii) may only be produced, marketed or used in a certain manner or for specific purposes, (iii) may
only be used under certain circumstances or (iv) may only be distributed to certain persons. We are not aware of any such
orders having been issued by the German government authorities that would have an impact on our business.

**Soil Contamination**

Pursuant to the German Federal Soil Protection Act _(Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz, “BBodSchG”), the responsibility for_
residual pollution and harmful changes to the soil lies with the party who caused a harmful soil change or a contaminated
site, its universal successor, the relevant property owner, the occupant of the relevant real property and, if the title was
transferred after March 1, 1999, the previous owner of the property, if they knew or must have known about the
contamination. There is no general statutory ranking as to which of the aforementioned parties is primarily liable. Rather,
this decision is made at the discretion of the relevant local authority who will take into account the effectiveness of
remediation as a prevailing factor. Thus, the current owner of the contaminated property is usually the first party to be held
responsible because the owner is generally in the best position to undertake the necessary remediation work. However, the
other responsible parties are required to indemnify the party that carried out the remediation work, regardless of which


-----

party is held liable by the relevant local authority. Where no other arrangements are agreed upon, the obligation to provide
compensation and the extent of the compensation to be provided depend on the extent to which the hazard or damage was
caused primarily by one party or the other. Liability is not based on fault. Thus, the BBodSchG does not require the relevant
local authority to prove negligence or intent on the part of the liable parties.

According to the BBodSchG the competent authority may require risk inspections, investigations, remedial measures and
other measures necessary for the prevention of residual pollution or harmful changes in the soil.

**Regulation governing the Operation of Waste-to-Energy Plant**

**_General overview_**

In connection with the operation of our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt, we are (and in connection with
the operation of our proposed further waste-to-energy plant in Sandersdorf-Brehna we will be) subject to a wide range of
laws and regulations specifically governing the German energy sector.

The key legislation containing the core provisions of German energy law is the Energy Industry Act (Gesetz über die
_Elektrizitäts- und Gasversorgung—Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, “EnWG”)._

Other German laws and ordinances specifically relevant to the energy sector and to waste-to-energy plants include:

(i) the Co-Generation Act (Kraft-Wärme-Kopplungsgesetz, “KWKG”);

(ii) the Federal Emission Protection Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, “BImSchG”);

(iii) the Green House Gas Permission Trading Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz, “TEHG”); and

(iv) the Fuel Emissions Trading Act (Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz, “BEHG”).

**_Energy Industry Act (EnWG) and related regulation_**

The EnWG provides, inter alia, the legal framework for ensuring competition within the German energy markets, mainly
by regulating electricity and gas networks to ensure reliable and efficient supply networks. It also implements relevant EU
law in relation to energy supply. Companies that supply third parties with energy or own or operate transmission and
distribution networks have to ensure that electricity is supplied in accordance with these aims.

_Grid access and network tariffs_

As grid operators enjoy a natural monopoly, electricity grid operators are obligated to provide connection to and use of
electricity grids without discrimination and in a transparent manner.

Electricity grid operators are required to connect third parties, such as generation facilities (including our waste-to-energy
plants), to the grid. The conditions for a connection must be non-discriminatory, proportionate, transparent and not less
favorable than the conditions granted to a grid operator’s own, affiliated or associated undertakings. A grid operator may
refuse the connection if it is, for operational or other economic or technical reasons, impossible or unreasonable. The burden
of proving that a connection is economically or technically impossible or unreasonable lies with the grid operator.

Tariffs for grid access are determined by the grid operators in accordance with incentive regulation based on the Ordinance
on the Incentive Regulation of Energy Supply Networks (Verordnung über die Anreizregulierung der
_Energieversorgungsnetze) and the StromNEV._

_Grid operators’ rights in case of congestion and emergency_

Pursuant to the EnWG, electricity grid operators are obliged to ensure the security and reliability of the grid. Therefore,
they are entitled and required to take the necessary actions to avoid any risks to the security or reliability of the grid. If the
security or reliability of the grid is endangered or disturbed, grid operators are required and authorized to rectify the problem
by making use of (i) grid-related measures, which entail technical measures that do not involve the network users, such as
internal energy balancing or pressure adjustment; and/or (ii) market-related measures which involve certain network users.
Market-related measures are based on contractual agreements between the grid operator and certain users relating to the
feed in and off-take of energy which allow energy balancing and making use of interruptible capacities (capacity bookings
which are not firm and, therefore, may be interrupted). If the grid operator cannot eliminate the disturbance by making use
of any of these measures, the operator is entitled to adjust and/or reduce feed-ins, electricity transits and electricity off

-----

takes without any obligation to pay compensation. In principle, feed-ins from conventional generation must be reduced
before feed-ins from co-generation facilities (such as our waste-to-energy plant) or renewable energy facilities. However,
if the grid operator has unreasonably rejected proposals by generation installation operators to conclude agreements on
interruptible capacities, compensation must be paid by the grid operator. Furthermore, compensation must be paid to cogeneration and renewable energy installations in case of a reduction of feed-ins if disturbances are caused due to grid
congestion.

_Grid access and off-take_

Grid operators are required to give priority grid access to certain co-generation plant operators, including Progroup Power
1 GmbH and Progroup Power 2 GmbH as operators of our current and proposed future waste-to-energy plants, with the
same priority as that granted to renewable energies and to off-take, transmit and distribute their co-generation electricity
on a priority basis.

Notwithstanding the obligation to purchase, transmit and distribute electricity from co-generation plants and producers of
renewable energy, a grid operator is required to ensure the technical stability of the grid and, for this purpose, is entitled to
avoid an overload of the grid by managing the feed-in of electricity from all parties feeding electricity into its grid (feedin/grid congestion management). If after exhausting certain grid-related and market-related measures, the grid operator has
not successfully reduced the overload in the grid and congestion remains, it is entitled to reduce the electricity which can
be fed into the grid. Within this mandatory reduction, the grid operator is required to treat the electricity from certain cogeneration sources (including our waste-to-energy plant), from renewable energy sources (such as wind farms or solar
energy) and from mine gas preferentially. The grid operator is required to implement congestion management by which,
in principle, feed-in from installations using conventional energy resources (gas, coal) must be reduced first. The political
parties forming the current German Federal Government have indicated in their coalition agreement that they intend to
amend the legal framework for congestion management (including the rules for compensation, if any, to be paid) while
maintaining the general concept of priority access for electricity from renewable sources, as well as from co-generation.

The grid operator has an obligation to off-take the electricity produced at co-generation plants within the meaning of the
KWKG, such as our waste-to-energy plant, at a price mutually agreed between the grid operator and the operator of the cogeneration plant plus a surcharge. In addition to the surcharge, the grid operator is required to pay so-called “avoided grid
fees” due to the decentralized feed-in by the co-generation plant (“Entgelt für dezentrale Einspeisung”, Section 18
paragraph 1 StromNEV). If no agreement is reached regarding the electricity price, the grid operator has to off-take the
electricity at the “standard market price”. The “standard market price” for electricity produced by installations depends on
their capacity.

**_Carbon Emission Compliance_**

The TEHG implemented the EU ETS for CO2 emission allowances in Germany. The allowances are traded in certain
trading periods, which requires certain energy and industry sectors to comply with the applicable greenhouse gas emissions
caps. Overall, only a limited number of allowances—determined in advance for the trading period—are available to
emission sources, subject to the EU ETS. Participation in this system has been mandatory since 2005 for all industries with
high energy consumption levels, including the paper industry. The regulations of the TEHG state that sources under
emission trading obligation are required to obtain approval to emit greenhouse gases, to comply with a cap of emission
allowances allocated to them and to maintain a monitoring process to determine and to document their emissions. The
legislation also provides for the possibility of trading (selling and buying) excess allowances in the open market. Like our
three paper mills, a part of our existing waste-to-energy plant in Eisenhüttenstadt is subject to the EU ETS.

The overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge has been constantly reduced over the different
trading periods. Under the currently applicable EU ETS, the EU-wide quantity of emission allowances allocated each year
is reduced by a linear factor of 4.3% as from 2024 annually as compared to the average annual total quantity of emission
allowances issued in the EU between 2008 and 2012 (which amounts to an annual reduction of the allowances to be issued
in the EU of 87,924,231 allowances) and of 4.4% as from 2028 (or 89,968,981 per year). To achieve the target of cutting
EU emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and of climate neutrality within the EU by 2050, according to the
Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality (“European Climate Law”) a
further reduction is made by 90,000,000 allowances in 2024 and further 27,000,000 allowances in 2026. According to this
reduction path, the total quantity of newly issued allowances will be zero in 2040. Until then, the transitional free allocation
of allowances will continue on a reduced scale. On June 5, 2023, the 2023 Directive (EU) 2023/959 amending the Emissions
Trading Directive 2003/87/EC (“Emissions Trading Directive”) entered into force. According to the amended version of
the Emissions Trading Directive, the free allocation will be reduced to 0% until 2030, except for district heating, which
will continue to receive a free allocation of 30%. As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed their emission
allowances will have to purchase a significant, and steadily increasing, share of increasingly pricy emission allowances in
auctions, which may result in substantial additional cost for such companies. An exemption from the general auctioning
mechanism is available for certain energy-intensive industries which are exposed to a significant risk of relocation of plants


-----

to countries with less stringent climate protection laws (a phenomenon known as “Carbon Leakage”). Since 2010, the
European Commission will determine every five years which industries are threatened by Carbon Leakage. The designated
industries will be allocated emission allowances free of charge for the period determined amounting to 100%. Since the
paper industry has been granted the relevant status, our three mills receive CO2 emission certificates free of charge. On
February 15, 2019, the European Commission adopted the Carbon Leakage List for the years 2021-2030. According to this
list, the paper industry is considered threatened by Carbon Leakage. However, the allocation of 100% does not necessarily
mean that the allocation is in line with the demand. The product benchmarks, which determine the amount of allowances
allocated free of charge, are based on the average performance of the 10% most efficient installations in a sector or
subsector in the Union and will decline by 0.3 to 2.5% per year, calculated from the year 2008, in order to account for
expected emission reductions due to technological progress.

A part of the Carbon Leakage industry sectors are allowed to apply for financial compensation for the increase of electricity
costs due to EU ETS allowance costs passed on in electricity prices, among which is the paper and paperboard industry.
The compensation is not enforceable and is granted from funds provided in the federal budget for that purpose for the
relevant year.

From 2024 onwards, fuels that are used in waste incineration plants requiring an immission control permit pursuant to
Number 8.1.1 (or 8.1.2 with waste oil as the main fuel) Annex 1 of the 4th Federal Immission Control Ordinance (Vierte
_Verordnung zum BImSchG, “4. BImSchV”) are subject to reporting requirements and the obligation to surrender emission_
allowances under the BEHG for CO2 emissions stemming from the fossil part of the fuels. This will apply to our wasteto-energy plants. At the same time, from 2024 installations for the incineration of municipal waste with a total rated thermal
input exceeding 20 MW are subject to reporting requirements also under the EU ETS. By 2026, the European Commission
will assess the feasibility of a full inclusion in the EU ETS of these installations from 2028.

**_Environmental laws and other related laws and regulations_**

Like the operation of our three paper mills, the operation of our waste-to-energy plant requires active permits under the
BImSchG, it triggers the various duties and potential liability under the Federal Water Management Act (WHG), the
Federal Waste Management Act (KrWG) and the Federal Soil Protection Act (BBodSchG), and it is subject to the rules for
the protection of nature and landscape, as well as flora and fauna, that are codified in the Federal Nature Conservation Act
(Bundesnaturschutzgesetz, “BNatSchG”) and the State Nature Conservation Acts (Landesnaturschutzgesetz) in the Federal
State of Brandenburg. For more details, please also see “—Regulatory Environment—Environmental Laws” _and “—_
_Regulatory Environment—Soil Contamination” above._

The technological standards applicable in relation to the requirements under the BImSchG are substantiated by technical
regulations as determined in ordinances based on the BImSchG or technical regulations, as amended from time to time.
For our waste-to-energy plants, the 13[th] Ordinance (Ordinance on Large Combustion Plants, Gas Turbine Plants and
Internal Combustion Engines, 13. Verordnung zum BImSchG, “13. BImSchV”) and the 17. BImSchV are of particular
importance, the latter one particularly with regard to the co-incineration of sewage sludge. The legal framework for the
utilization/disposal of sewage sludge is currently being revised with the aim of a better recovery of phosphates, which may
lead to a declining use of sewage sludge in incineration plants.

The compliance with emission limits, which are stipulated in the permit for our waste-to-energy plant, will be controlled
regularly and, if necessary, can be altered subsequently by the authorities. The competent authority may withdraw the
permit if our waste-to-energy plant does not comply with the applicable emission limits as determined in the permit.

**LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**

From time to time, we are involved in administrative, legal and arbitration proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
business. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are currently involved in any litigation, administrative proceedings or
arbitration relating to claims or amounts that are material to our business and, to our knowledge, no such litigation,
administrative proceeding or arbitration is pending or threatened. The outcome of legal proceedings, however, are difficult
to predict with any certainty and we can offer no assurances in this regard.


-----

**SHAREHOLDERS**

91.05% of the registered share capital of the Issuer are being held by JH-Holding, a holding company controlled by our
founder and vice-chairman of our Supervisory Board, Jürgen Heindl. The remaining 8.95% of the registered share capital
of the Issuer are being held by four minority shareholders who are not involved in the management of our business. Pursuant
to a shareholders’ agreement, the four minority shareholders have completely submitted their voting rights to the voting of
the majority, which is held by JH-Holding. As a result, the four minority shareholders are currently not able to influence
the composition of the Supervisory Board.

The shareholders of JH-Holding, which has a share capital of €1,000,000, are Jürgen Heindl and his two sons, Maximilian
Heindl and Vinzenz Heindl. Jürgen Heindl holds two “golden shares” with a nominal amount of €1,000 which together
provide Jürgen Heindl with a qualified majority of more than 75% of the voting rights in the shareholders’ meeting of
JH-Holding. His two sons, Maximilian Heindl and Vinzenz Heindl, each hold 49.9% of JH-Holding’s shares. Based on a
pooling agreement entered into between the shareholders of JH-Holding, Jürgen Heindl controls 100% of the voting rights
in the shareholders’ meeting of JH-Holding.


-----

**MANAGEMENT**

**OVERVIEW**

In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), the Issuer has a two-tier board system consisting of
an Executive Board (Vorstand) and a Supervisory Board (Aufsichtsrat). The two boards are separate, and, subject to a
limited exception, no individual may serve concurrently as a member of both boards.

The Executive Board is responsible for managing our day-to-day business in accordance with applicable German law and
the Articles of Association (Satzung) as well as its rules of procedure (Geschäftsordnung). In addition, the Executive Board
must ensure appropriate control of risk within the Issuer and its subsidiaries in order that any developments jeopardizing
the Issuer’s future as a going concern may be identified at an early stage. The Executive Board legally represents the Issuer
in dealings with third parties and in court.

The Supervisory Board advises the Executive Board on the management of the Issuer, monitors its conduct of business and
is responsible for appointing and dismissing the members of the Executive Board for good cause. It also represents the
Issuer in transactions between a member of the Executive Board and the Issuer. While the Executive Board is responsible
for submitting regular reports on our business activities and fundamental issues relating to corporate planning (including
financial, investment and personnel planning) to the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board has the right to request
special reports at any time from the Executive Board. The Executive Board is also obliged to duly report to the Supervisory
Board such transactions as may be of considerable importance to the Issuer’s profitability (in particular the return on equity)
or liquidity, so that the Supervisory Board may have an opportunity to express its opinion on such transactions before they
are concluded. The Supervisory Board may also request a report at any time on matters concerning the Issuer, on the legal
and commercial relationships with affiliated companies or on commercial operations at these companies that may have a
significant impact on the Issuer and its subsidiaries.

The Supervisory Board generally may not exercise management functions. The rules of procedure of the Executive Board,
however, require that certain types of transactions may not be carried out by the Executive Board without the prior consent
of the Supervisory Board. If the Supervisory Board refuses to approve a certain transaction or business activity
contemplated by the Executive Board, the Executive Board can request that the general shareholders’ meeting decide on
the matter. However, the general shareholders’ meeting of a German stock corporation may not issue directives to the
Executive Board.

The members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board owe duties of loyalty and care vis-à-vis the Issuer. In
discharging their duties, the members of these corporate bodies must consider a broad range of interests, including our
interests, which in turn include the interests of our shareholders, employees, creditors and, to a certain extent, the general
public. The Executive Board must also take due account of the shareholders’ right to equal treatment and equal information.
The members of the Executive Board or of the Supervisory Board are jointly and severally liable to the Issuer for any
damages that may arise if they fail to discharge their duties.

As a basic principle under German law, a shareholder has no direct recourse against the members of the Executive Board
or the Supervisory Board in the event that they breach a duty vis-à-vis the Issuer. Except for certain special circumstances,
only the Issuer itself has the right to bring claims for damages against members of either board, whereby the Issuer is
represented by the Executive Board when bringing claims against the Supervisory Board and by the Supervisory Board
when bringing claims against the Executive Board. Pursuant to a ruling by the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof), the Supervisory Board is obliged to bring claims which are likely to be successful against the
Executive Board unless material considerations pertaining to the interest of the corporation outweigh or are at least
equivalent to those in favor of enforcing such claim. Despite a refusal of the Supervisory Board to pursue a claim for
damages, such a claim must be enforced (i) upon a resolution of the general shareholders’ meeting, (ii) upon a petition with
the competent court by minority shareholders meeting a certain minimum requirement as to their stake in the Issuer, or
(iii) by the Issuer’s creditors whose claims could not be settled by the Issuer. The Issuer may only waive or settle such
claims for damages if at least three years have passed and if the shareholders approve the waiver or settlement at the general
shareholders’ meeting with a simple majority of the votes cast, provided that opposing shareholders do not hold, in the
aggregate, one tenth or more of the share capital and do not have their opposition formally recorded in the minutes of the
shareholders’ meeting.

Under German law, no individual shareholder (or any other person) may exert its influence on the Issuer to cause a member
of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board to engage in any act detrimental to the Issuer. Shareholders with a
controlling interest may not use it to cause the Issuer to act against its own interest unless the prejudice to its interests is
compensated for. Any shareholder using its interest in the Issuer to cause a member of the Executive Board, a member of
the Supervisory Board or a person who holds a power of attorney (Prokurist) or is authorized to act for the Issuer
(Handlungsbevollmächtigter) to engage in any act detrimental to the Issuer or to our shareholders must compensate the


-----

Issuer and the shareholders for any loss sustained thereby. In addition, the members of the Executive Board and the
members of the Supervisory Board are jointly and severally liable if they act in breach of their obligations.

Progroup AG provides for a directors and officers liability insurance policy for all members of the Executive Board and
the Supervisory Board and for certain other managers with leadership responsibilities within Progroup AG and its
subsidiaries.

**Executive Board**

**_General Information_**

The Executive Board is responsible for managing the business of the Issuer in accordance with the German Stock
Corporation Act, the Issuer’s Articles of Association and the rules of procedure (Geschäftsordnung) for the Executive
Board. The Executive Board also represents the Issuer in its dealings with third parties and in court. According to the
Articles of Association and the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Executive Board must consist of a
minimum of one member. The Supervisory Board determines the number of members of the Executive Board and appoints
such members. It may also appoint the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board. Members of the Executive
Board are appointed for a maximum term of five years. They may be repeatedly reappointed or their term of office may be
extended, in each instance for a period of up to five years. The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of a member
of the Executive Board before the end of his or her term of office for good cause, such as gross breach of duty or in case
of a vote of no confidence by the general shareholders’ meeting.

The Executive Board has overall responsibility for the Issuer’s business. In accordance with its allocation-ofresponsibilities plan (Geschäftsverteilungsplan), each member of the Executive Board is assigned an area of responsibility
defined in such plan, which sets out the allocation of responsibilities. Notwithstanding the overall responsibility held by
the Executive Board, each member of the Executive Board is responsible for the area allocated to him or her. Pursuant to
the rules of procedure (Geschäftsordnung) for the Executive Board, certain management actions may only be taken, and
certain types of transactions may only be concluded, with the approval of the Supervisory Board. As a rule, the Executive
Board should meet every week. The Executive Board has a quorum if a meeting has been called with due notice and all or,
in the event that the Executive Board has more than two members, at least half of the members which must include the
Chairman are present. If not otherwise required by law, the Executive Board decides by a simple majority of the votes cast.
In the event of a tie, the Chairman has the deciding vote. Members of the Executive Board may not deal with, or vote on,
measures relating to proposals, arrangements or contracts between him/herself and the Issuer.

Individual board members serve as representatives with primary responsibility for the Issuer’s various corporate functions
and for the fields of business in which the Issuer operates. Despite this internal allocation of responsibilities, each member
of the Executive Board has overall responsibility (Gesamtverantwortung) for the Issuer as a whole.

The Issuer’s Articles of Association provide that the Issuer can be legally represented by two members of the Executive
Board or by one member of the Executive Board in conjunction with an authorized signatory who holds a power of attorney
(Prokurist). The Supervisory Board has granted the Chairman, Mr. Maximilian Heindl, authorization to solely represent
the Issuer in accordance with the Articles of Association.

The Supervisory Board may appoint deputy members of the Executive Board who, in accordance with the German Stock
Corporation Act, have the same rights and responsibilities as the regular members of the Executive Board.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Provision of Share Pledges by JH-Holding and our Minority Shareholders**

In connection with the Offering, the Issuer proposes to enter into certain agreements with JH-Holding and the minority
shareholders. The agreements provide for JH-Holding and the minority shareholders to continue to grant security over their
shares in the Issuer to secure our obligations under certain of our credit facilities and the Notes. In return, the Issuer has to
pay an annual fee of 0.5% of the equity value of the shares in the Issuer. The annual fee is capped at 0.5% of the credit
facilities (including the Notes) secured by the share pledges. As an alternative to the payment of the annual fee, the Issuer
is entitled to settle its payment obligations by a lump sum fee payment. We expect that the fees owed to JH-Holding and
the minority shareholders under the agreements for the period from 2024 until December 31, 2030 will be approximately
€21.1 million, such amount already reflecting a reduction by approximately €5.0 million due to payments already made for
the period from 2024 to 2027 under corresponding agreements entered into by the Issuer with JH-Holding and the minority
sharesolders in connection with the Existing Notes in 2018.

**Certain Agreements with JH-Holding and Subsidiaries**

The Issuer provides management services to its shareholder JH-Holding and certain of JH-Holding’s subsidiaries
comprising, in particular, accounting services and assistance in the preparation of financial statements and reporting,
pursuant to a service framework agreement dated December 9, 2022. In 2023, the Issuer invoiced €0.1 million for such
management services. Under the same agreement, JH-Holding and its subsidiaries Professionals Academy SPO GmbH and
JHH Aviation GmbH provide services to the Issuer and the Issuer’s subsidiaries, comprising, amongst others, support of
distribution activities and site searches for new plants, business and market intelligence services and aviation services. In
2023, the Issuer was invoiced €0.4 million by JH-Holding for such services.

Professionals Academy SPO GmbH also provides certain services to customers of Progroup Board GmbH, comprising,
amongst other, business and market intelligence services and the organisation of management trainings and conferences.
Pursuant to agreements dated December 20, 2021 and June 30, 2023, respectively, Progroup partially covers the costs for
trainings provided by Professionals Academy SPO GmbH to Progroup’s customers. In 2023, the Issuer was invoiced €0.1
million by Professionals Academy SPO GmbH for such trainings.

In 2023, the Issuer and certain other group companies sold art objects for a purchase price of €0.6 million and used motor
vehicles for a purchase price of €0.02 million to JH-Holding.

Furthermore, the D&O insurance for the Issuer’s management is paid by JH-Holding, which is partly reimbursed by the
Issuer for the premiums related to such D&O insurance.

**Legal services rendered by Rittershaus Rechtsanwälte Partnerschaftsgesellschaft mbB**

The law firm Rittershaus Rechtsanwälte PartmbB, Mannheim, Frankfurt/Main, Munich, has been providing legal advice
to Progroup AG and other members of the Group on various matters for a number of years. Rainer Dietmann, who serves

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our indebtedness does not_
_purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the underlying documents. Unless_
_otherwise defined in this offering memorandum or unless the context otherwise requires, terms defined in the Senior_
_Secured Facilities Agreements and the Intercreditor Agreement shall have the same meanings when used in this section._

**OVERVIEW**

On December 21, 2017, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreements. The
Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement originally provided for a €8.5 million Facility A and a €30.0 million Facility B,
both refinanced by KfW, which we have fully utilized. However, as of December 31, 2018, the amount repayable under
Facility A was reduced to €7.155 million as a result of a €1.345 million repayment grant.

On July 13, 2018, to fund a portion of the expected investment into the establishment of our newest paper mill (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into several additional facilities agreements,
including (i) an amendment and restatement of the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement, adding an additional €25.0
million Facility C, refinanced by KfW, (ii) the €25.0 million 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement, refinanced
by KfW and (iii) the €75.0 million Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement, which consist of a €45.0 million
Facility A, refinanced by KfW, and two separate €15.0 million facilities (Facility B and Facility C), financed by
Commerzbank itself. All these facilities have been fully utilized as of the date of this offering memorandum and are being
repaid in accordance with the terms of each facility as described in more detail below.

On May 31, 2019, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into the €30.0 million Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility
Agreement, the €30.0 million Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement and the €15.0 million 2019 Senior Secured
SaarLB Facility Agreement, primarily to fund the approximately €80 to 85 million of total investment into our newest
corrugated board “mega plant” (PW14) in Strykow, Poland. All these facilities have also been fully utilized as of the date
of this offering memorandum and are being repaid in accordance with the terms of each facility as described in more detail
below.

On July 24, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
which provides for up to €200.0 million of committed credit that may be drawn by certain members of the Group specified
therein from time to time, and on September 20, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into the €60.0 million Senior
Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement, to fund a portion of the expected investment into the establishment of our
proposed new corrugated board plant (PW16) in Cessalto, Italy. We expect the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement to remain undrawn as of the Issue Date. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the Senior Secured IKBDZ BANK Facility Agreement was fully drawn.

All our Senior Secured Facilities are being guaranteed irrevocably and unconditionally, subject to certain customary
limitations and agreed security principles, on a joint and several basis, by the Issuer and the Guarantors. The lenders under
each Senior Secured Facilities Agreement have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement. Any amounts outstanding under
the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements are secured by the same Collateral that secures each other Senior Secured Facility
and, upon issuance of the Notes, the Notes.

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreements each contain customary events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed
grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications) including, a cross default (including with respect to an event of default
under, and as defined in, the Conditions of Issue), non-payment, misrepresentation, insolvency and insolvency proceedings,
unlawfulness, litigation and material adverse change the occurrence of which would allow the agent under each Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement (who shall do so if directed by the required majority of the lenders) to accelerate all or part
of the loan outstanding and/or terminate any available commitments and/or exercise any of its rights and remedies under
the relevant Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, as applicable, and other related finance documents.

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreements each contain customary information and general loan style covenants as well as
restrictive covenants that closely track those contained in the Conditions of Issue. On March 15, 2024, we entered into
certain amendment agreements in relation to the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements (collectively, the “2024 Facility
**Amendment Agreements”). Among other things, in the 2024 Facility Amendment Agreements, the relevant finance**
parties, subject to completion of the Refinancing and customary conditions precedent, agreed to (i) replace the covenant
schedules of each Senior Secured Facility, so that the restrictive covenants in the covenant schedule of each facility will
closely track the relevant restrictive covenants contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes and (ii) to enter into the
amendment and restatement agreement in relation to the Intercreditor Agreement described below.

The Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with them
are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with German law.


-----

Following the completion of the Refinancing, we further intend to enter into an amendment and restatement agreement
relating to the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition to various technical amendments that will not adversely affect the
Holders in any material respect, we intend to amend and restate the Intercreditor Agreement to (i) insert a formal mechanism
for the resignation of Secured Creditors (as defined under the Intercreditor Agreement) as parties to the Intercreditor
Agreement following the termination and discharge in full of the Primary Finance Documents (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to which they originally became Secured Creditors, (ii) delete references to the old super
senior revolving credit facility of the Group that was terminated in 2023, (iii) amend the definition of “Credit Facility” in
the intercreditor agreement to“Super Senior Credit Facility” in order to reflect the deviating usage of such term in the
Conditions of Issue that will govern the Notes and the covenant schedules of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and
(iv) provide for a mechanism that permits the granting of Security in favor of Pari Passu Debt Creditors (or their affiliates)
which make available ancillary facilities pursuant to the terms of a Pari Passu Debt Document (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement). In the 2024 Facility Amendment Agreements, the finance parties under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreements also agreed to execute and/or instruct the relevant facility agents and the Security Agent to execute,
at the request of the Issuer, one or more amendment and restatement agreements to the Intercreditor Agreement so the
Intercreditor Agreement will be so amended and restated. Similarly, the Conditions of Issue that will govern the Notes will
provide, that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders’ representative in relation to the Notes,
the Security Agent or any holder of the Notes, the holders’ representative in relation to the Notes and the Security Agent
shall enter into the proposed amendment and restatement to the Intercreditor Agreement. The descriptions of certain
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement set forth under “—Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement” below
therefore summarize the relevant provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement as so amended and restated.

**SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT**

On July 24, 2023, we entered into the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. The Senior Secured Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement provides for €200.0 million of committed financing (the “Total Commitments”), which is
available for utilization by way of the drawing of cash revolving loans, and by way of ancillary facilities, until the date
falling one month prior to the Final RCF Maturity Date (as defined below) and replace our previous €50.0 million super
senior revolving credit facility agreement we originally entered into on April 23, 2015, as amended, supplemented and
restated from time to time.

The original borrowers under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are the Issuer, Progroup Board
s.r.o., Progroup Board sp. z o.o. and Progroup Board Ltd. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is
being guaranteed by the Guarantors (as defined below under “Security and Guarantees”) and the Issuer. The original
lenders under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Deutsche
Bank Luxembourg S.A., Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, Erste Group Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE,
and the facility agent (the “Agent”) under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft.

**_Increase Option_**

The Issuer may, on one or more occasions and subject to certain conditions set out in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, by delivering to the Agent a duly completed increase request no later than thirty (30) business days
nor earlier than sixty (60) business days before the date on which such increase is to take effect, request an increase of the
total commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in an amount that is €10 million or, if
more, an integral multiple of €1 million, provided that the aggregate amount of any such increases of the total commitments
must not exceed €50 million. This provision will give us the option to increase the total commitments under the Senior
Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from currently €200 million to up to €250 million. Each lender under the
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will have the right, at its sole discretion, to agree or reject (in whole
or in part) an increase request. If, following an allocation process set for the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, the
amount of the increased commitments of the existing lenders under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement is less than requested by the Issuer, the Issuer may (through the Agent) then request any existing lender under
the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement which is willing to do so (or another bank or financial institution
which is not an existing lender and which is willing to do so) to (additionally) further increase its commitment by such
amount notified to it, or part thereof, (or, as the case may be, accede to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement as a lender with such new commitment), subject to certain conditions set forth in the Senior Secured Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Ancillary Facilities_**

A lender (or any of its affiliates) may make available to a borrower under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement all or part of that lender’s undrawn commitment in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
by way of ancillary facilities such as overdraft facilities, guarantees, bonding, documentary or stand-by letter of credit
facilities, short-term loan facilities, foreign exchange facilities or any other facility or accommodation required in


-----

connection with the business of the Group and which is agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lender (or its affiliate),
other than derivative or other transactions where the potential loss may be greater than the relevant ancillary lender’s
commitments under the ancillary facility plus customary interest and fees, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions
precedent.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will terminate on July 24, 2028; provided that at least 60 days,
but not more than 90 days, prior to any anniversary of the date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
the Issuer, by written notice to the Agent, may request an extension of the final maturity date applicable to the Senior
Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement in effect at such time so that the final maturity date is extended by one year
from its then scheduled expiration; provided further that there may only be up to two such extensions to the final maturity
date applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and in no event shall the finanal maturity date
applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement extend beyond July 24, 2030 (the final maturity date
as so extended, if applicable, the “Final RCF Maturity Date”). Each lender under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement will have the right, at its sole discretion, to agree or reject any request we may make to extend the Final
RCF Maturity Date as described above. If less than all of the lenders under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement consent in writing to any extension request (but lenders whose commitments aggregate more than half of the
Total Commitments have so consented, the Final RCF Maturity Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the
applicable anniversary date, and subject to a process set forth in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
providing for the potential replacement of non-consenting lenders with existing lenders that are willing to extend the Final
RCF Maturity Date and increase their commitments (or other banks or financial institutions which are not existing lenders
and which are willing to do so), be extended by one year as to those lenders that agree to a requested extension, but not as
to any other lender under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Any amounts still outstanding under
the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement on the Final RCF Maturity Date will be immediately due and
payable.

Subject to certain conditions, we may voluntarily prepay our utilizations and/or permanently cancel all or part of the
available commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement by giving three business days’ prior
notice to the Agent (provided that such prepayment or cancellation must be, if in part, in a minimum amount of €1 million)
or the remainder if the outstanding loan or the remaining commitments are less than €1 million.

Amounts prepaid or repaid may (subject to the terms of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) be reborrowed.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including with respect to any lender,
if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice to the Agent
describing the transaction or transactions that constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s
participation under the loans on the date specified in such notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) which date shall be no
earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Repayment
**Date”), but no later than the respective change of control offer for any of the other Senior Secured Debt (as defined below).**
Pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, each lender will have the right to require the original borrowers to repay such
lender's participation in any loans together with accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts accrued under the
finance documents in respect of any such participation in any such loans on the Change of Control Repayment Date,
whereupon the commitment of that lender will be cancelled.

“Change of Control” means the occurrence of the following:

(i) for as long as no Public Market exists for the Capital Stock of the Issuer (or a Holding Company), the
Issuer becoming aware of any “person” or “group” of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to
such term in Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz) other than a Permitted Holder acquiring and holding,
directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Voting Stock of the
Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a Public Market exists for the Capital Stock of the Issuer (or a Holding Company), the
Issuer becoming aware of (i) any “person” or “group” of persons acting in concert in the meaning given
to such term in Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz) other than a Permitted Holder acquiring and holding,


-----

directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% of the issued and outstanding Voting Stock of the
Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares and (ii) Permitted Holders holding,
directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued and outstanding Voting Stock of the Issuer
measured by voting power rather than number of shares than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or consolidation
or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person other than a
Permitted Holder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or substantially
all of assets of the Issuer.

“Senior Secured Debt” means the aggregate principal amount outstanding, from time to time, under the Notes, any
borrowings under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any other liabilities of the Issuer or the Guarantors in
respect of any loan, credit or guarantee facility, notes, indenture or security that rank equally in right of payment with the
liabilities under the Notes and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, as applicable, and which are permitted to be
incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and are permitted under the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement to share (and do share) in the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis as the creditors in relation
to the Notes and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement bears interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR, plus an
initial margin of 2.15% per annum; provided that the initial margin may be adjusted based on the Issuer’s long-term credit
ratings assigned by S&P and/or Moody’s from time to time, following a margin grid which provides for a margin range
from 1.50% per annum to 3.00% per annum. Such margin may be further adjusted by deducting or adding up to 3 basis
points to the then applicable margin depending on the achievement or non-achievement of certain targets with regard to
certain environmental, social and governance key performance indicators.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrear at the end of each calendar quarter during the availability period,
on available but unused commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement at a rate of 35% of
the then applicable margin under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

We are also required to pay fees related to the issuance of ancillary facilities and certain fees to the arrangers, the Agent
and the Security Agent in connection with the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement is being guaranteed irrevocably and unconditionally, subject to
certain customary limitations and agreed security principles, on a joint and several basis, by the Guarantors.

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also provides that (subject to certain customary limitations and
agreed security principles):

  - as at December 31 of each year (the “Accounting Reference Date”), the aggregate EBITDA of the Issuer and the
Guarantors (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Conditions of Issue),
eliminating the effects of all intra-Group transactions and provided that the EBITDA of any entity that is negative
shall be deemed to be zero, must represent at least 80% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (with the
EBITDA of any entity that is negative deemed to be zero) determined annually on the basis of the relevant
financial statements of the members of the Group (the “Guarantor Coverage Test”); provided that no breach of
the Guarantor Coverage Test shall occur if within 120 days of the delivery of the audited consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer for the financial year ended on the relevant Accounting Reference Date to the Agent the
Issuer procures, subject to agreed security principles, that additional Restricted Subsidiaries become Guarantors
such that if they had been Guarantors on the relevant Accounting Reference Date, the Guarantor Coverage Test
would have been satisfied.; and

  - (i) any wholly owned member of the Group that holds shares in an obligor (other than the Issuer) and (ii) a member
of the Group (other than the Issuer) that has EBITDA (calculated on same basis as Consolidated EBITDA
representing 10% or more of Consolidated EBITDA or has total assets or sales representing 10% or more of the
total assets or sales of the Group (in each case, after elimination of any effects of any intra-Group transactions)
must become a guarantor under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and grant security as the
Agent may require (subject to customary limitations and agreed security principles), within 120 days.


-----

**_Covenants_**

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains customary information and general loan style covenants
as well as restrictive covenants that closely track those contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes. In addition, the
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement imposes certain additional limitations on the incurrence of further
indebtedness on a super priority basis in the form of “Super Senior Credit Facility Liabilities” (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) (“Potential Super Senior Debt”). In particular, (i) members of the Group are only permitted to incur up to
€80 million of such Potential Super Senior Debt and only if the Issuer has previously delivered on e or more duly completed
increase requests to the Agent in accordance with the provisions described under “—Increase Option” above, requesting
an aggreagate amount tof increases of the Total Commitments up to the maximum amount of €50 million, (ii) unless any
such Potential Super Senior Debt is incurred under one or more credit facilities with one or more lenders under the Senior
Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the members of the Group shall apply any amounts borrowed to fund capital
expenditures of the Group, except that the members of the Group may apply up to €25 million of any such amounts
borrowed to fund the acquisition of current assets, (iii) the borrower of any Potential Super Senior Debt must be a borrower
under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and (iv) no event of default shall have occurred and be
continuing (or would reslt from the incurrence of any such Potential Super Senior Debt. In addition, the Senior Secured
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain provisions granting the lenders under the Senior Secured Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement a right of first refusal/offer before entering into any binding agreement with regard to any
Potential Super Senior Debt.

The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement further requires the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer and its
consolidated subsidiaries achieve a minimum EBTIDA in respect of any twelve-month period ending on a quarter-end date
(a “Testing Period”) during any time during which the aggregate base currency amount of all utilizations (in certain
circumstances taking into account proposed utilizations) and cash ancillary outstandings under the Senior Secured
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be greater than 40 per cent of the total commitments thereunder (a “Trigger
**Period”). The minimum EBITDA which the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries are required to achieve under the**
financial covenant will step up over time from an initial minimum EBITDA of €150 million to a minimum EBITDA of
€200 million for any twelve-month period ending on March 31, 2027 an each quarter-end date thereafter.

The financial covenant relating to the minimum EBITDA will be tested on quarterly test dates as long as a Trigger Period
is continuing.

**SENIOR SECURED IKB FACILITIES AGREEMENT**

On December 21, 2017, the Issuer, as company and borrower, Progroup Board GmbH and the other Guarantors as
guarantors, entered into a euro-denominated senior secured facility agreement (the “Senior Secured EUR Facility”) with
IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG as agent and original lender. The Senior Secured EUR Facility originally provided for
€38,500,000 of total committed credit, including (i) a €8.5 million term loan facility (“Facility A”) and (ii) a €30.0 million
term loan facility (“Facility B”). Both Facility A and Facility B are refinanced by funds made available by Kreditanstalt
für Wiederaufbau (“KfW”), the German government-owned development bank, under certain KfW programs that offer
subsidized funding for eligible investments that promote energy efficiency. We have fully utilized both Facility A and
Facility B. However, as of December 31, 2018, the amount repayable under Facility A was reduced to €7.155 million as a
result of a €1.345 million repayment grant. On July 13, 2018, to fund a portion of the expected investment into the
establishment of our newest paper mill (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, the Issuer, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH,
as borrower and guarantor, and the other Guarantors entered into an amendment and restatement of the Senior Secured
IKB Facilities Agreement, adding an additional €25.0 million term loan facility (“Facility C”), also refinanced by KfW9.
We have also fully utilized Faclity C.

The dedicated purposes of the borrowings under the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement were (i) to fund the
installation of a waste heat system for our paper machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany, in the case of the Facility A, (ii) to
fund certain eligible investments in connection with the establishment of our new corrugated board “mega plant” (PW12)
in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, in the case of the Facility B and (iii) to fund certain eligible investments in connection
with the establishment of our newest paper mill (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, in the case of the Facility C.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Facility A has a final maturity date of June 30, 2026, the Facility B has a final maturity date of December 30, 2027
and the Facility C has a final maturity date of June 30, 2027.

Subject to application of the repayment grant (Tilgungszuschuss) of €1,344,600 we were awarded as described below, we
are required to repay our borrowings under the Facility A in instalments by repaying on each Facility A repayment date an
amount which reduces the amount of the outstanding borrowings under the Facility A by an amount as set out in the
following table:

Under the terms of the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement, we applied for, and were awarded, a repayment grant
(Tilgungszuschuss) of €1,344,600 with regard to Facility A and of €3.95 million with regard to Facility C, in each case
funded from resources of the German Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) on the repayment of all amounts
borrowed under the relevant facility (each a “KfW Repayment Grant”). The amounts of each KfW Repayment Grant
were offset against the repayment instalments with regard to the relevant facility falling due after the date on which the
KfW Repayment Grant was granted. The amount of the KfW Repayment Grant was offset against the repayment
instalments with regard to the relevant facility in inverse chronological order, i.e., beginning with the repayment instalment
for the last repayment date with regard to the relevant facility.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loan outstanding under the
Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement by giving ten business days' prior notice to the agent (but if in part, being an
amount that reduces the amount of such loan by a minimum amount of €5 million or the remainder).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement require mandatory cancellation and, if
applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its
obligations under the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice to the agent under
the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement describing the transaction or transactions that constituted the Change of
Control and offer to repay each lender's participation in any loans under the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement in
the loans on the date specified in such notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days
and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Repayment Date”) but no later
than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other senior secured debt. Pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer, each lender under the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement will have the right to require us to prepay all or any
part of the principal amount of such lender's participation in the loans _plus break costs determined by each lender in_
accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an amount requested from such lender by KfW, plus, in each
case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts accrued under the finance documents.

“Change of Control”, for purposes of the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement, means the occurrence of the
following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company), the Issuer
becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term
in Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs_und Übernahmegesetz) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly,_
the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting
power rather than number of shares;


-----

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding company), the
Issuer becoming aware of (i) any “person” or “group” of persons acting in concert in the meaning given
to such term in Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und Übernahmegesetz) other than a permitted shareholder acquiring and holding,
directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer
measured by voting power rather than number of shares and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly
or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by
voting power rather than number of shares than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or consolidation
or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to a person other than a
permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Issuer;

(v) or in case of Facility C the Issuer ceases to hold (directly or indirectly) 100% of the shares in Progroup
Paper PM3 GmbH.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility A and the Facility B bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.45% per annum, and any borrowings
under the Facility C will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per annum.

We were also required to pay a commitment fee in arrear on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 30 at a
rate of 0.25% per month with regard to any available but unused commitments in relation to the Facility C during the period
starting on the date falling one day after August 8, 2019, until the last day of the relevant availability period.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that closely track those
contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement required us to submit to
KfW, via the agent under the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement, certain use of funds certificates
(Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that we have made use of the funds borrowed under the Facility A, the
Facility B and the Facility C, as applicable, in accordance with the specified purpose described above and relevant KfW
program rules. Furthermore, we are required to procure that the investment measures implemented with the borrowings
under the Facility A and Facility C are operated in accordance with their designated purpose for a period of at least five (5)
years (the “Minimum Operating Period”), and during the Minimum Operating Period, no part of the relevant investments
may, subject to the principle of proportionality, be abandoned or sold-off (unless the further operation in accordance with
the designated purpose is safeguarded).

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement, our relationship with the lenders under
the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement is also governed by the general terms and conditions of KfW, which are
incorporated into the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement by reference. In case of any conflict between the provisions
of the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement and the general terms and conditions of KfW, the provisions of the general
terms and conditions of KfW will prevail. In particular, in addition to the customary events of the default contained in the
Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement, the general terms and conditions of KfW also contain certain bespoke
termination rights related to the quasi-governmental nature of the subsidized funding provided by KfW, through IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, under the Senior Secured IKB Facilities Agreement.

**2018 SENIOR SECURED SAARLB FACILITY AGREEMENT**

On July 13, 2018, the Issuer, as company and original guarantor, Progroup Paper PM 3 GmbH as borrower and original
guarantor, and the other Guarantors as original guarantors, entered into a euro-denominated senior secured facility
agreement (the “2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement”) with Landesbank Saar as agent and original lender.
The 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement provides for €25,000,000 of total committed credit (the “Facility”).
The Facility is refinanced by funds made available by KfW under a certain KfW program that offers subsidized funding
for eligible investments that promote energy efficiency. Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH has fully utilized the Facility.


-----

The purpose of the borrowings under the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement was to partially fund certain
eligible investments in connection with the establishment of our newest paper mill (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Facility has a final maturity date of June 30, 2027.

We are required to repay our borrowings under the Facility in instalments by repaying on each repayment date an amount
which reduces the amount of the outstanding borrowings by an amount as set out in the following table:

**Repayment** **Repayment**

**Facility Repayment Date** **Installment in EUR** **Facility Repayment Date** **Installment in EUR**

Under the terms of the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement, we applied for, and were awarded, a repayment
grant (Tilgungszuschuss) of €3,944,999.11 funded from resources of the German Ministry of Economics and Technology
(BMWi) on the repayment of all amounts borrowed under the Facility (the “KfW Repayment Grant”). The amount of the
KfW Repayment Grant was offset against the repayment instalments falling due after the date on which the KfW
Repayment Grant was granted. The amount of the KfW Repayment Grant was offset against the repayment instalments
with regard to the Facility in inverse chronological order, _i.e., beginning with the repayment instalment for the last_
repayment date with regard to the Facility.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loan outstanding under the
2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement by giving ten business days' prior notice to the agent (but if in part, being
an amount that reduces the amount of such loan by a minimum amount of €3 million or the remainder). In case of a
prepayment must be made prior to the next Interest Payment no break costs must be paid.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement requires mandatory cancellation
and, if applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of
its obligations under the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice to the agent under
the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement describing the transaction or transactions that constituted the Change
of Control and offer to repay each lender's participation in any loans and to cancel each lender’s Commitment under the
2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement in the loans on the date specified in such notice (the “Change of Control
**Offer”) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the**
“Change of Control Repayment Date”) but no later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other
senior secured debt. Pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, each lender under the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility
Agreement will have the right to require us to prepay all or any part of the principal amount of such lender's participation
in the loans plus break costs determined by each lender in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an
amount requested from such lender by KfW, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts
accrued under the finance documents whereupon the Commitment of that lender will be cancelled.


-----

“Change of Control”, for purposes of the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement, means the occurrence of the
following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company), the Issuer
becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in Section
2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding company), the Issuer

becoming aware of (i) any “person” or “group” of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in
Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a permitted shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 30% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the
issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares than
such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or consolidation or other

business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or substantially all of the

assets of the Issuer; or

(v) the Issuer ceases to hold (directly or indirectly) 100% of the shares in Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.20% per annum.

We were also required to pay a commitment fee in arrear on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 30 at a
rate of 0.25% per month with regard to any available but unused commitments in relation to the Facility during the period
starting on the date falling one day after August 10, 2019, until the last day of the relevant availability period.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that closely track those
contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement required us to
submit to KfW, via the agent under the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement, certain use of funds certificates

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement, our relationship with the lenders
under the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement is also governed by the general terms and conditions of KfW,
which are incorporated into the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement by reference. In case of any conflict
between the provisions of the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement and the general terms and conditions of
KfW, the provisions of the general terms and conditions of KfW will prevail. In particular, in addition to the customary
events of the default contained in the 2018 Senior Secured SaarLB Facility Agreement, the general terms and conditions

**SENIOR SECURED COMMERZBANK FACILITIES AGREEMENT**

On July 13, 2018, the Issuer, as company and original guarantor, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH as borrower and original
guarantor, and the other Guarantors as original guarantors, entered into a euro-denominated senior secured facilities

have fully utilized Facility A, Facility B and Facility C.

The purpose of the borrowings under the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement was to fund certain eligible
investments in connection with the establishment of our newest paper mill (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.
Borrowings under Facility B and Facility C could also be used for other capital expenditures of the Group if we reasonably
concluded that the amounts borrowed count for the purpose of financing PM3.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Facility A has a final maturity date of June 30, 2027 and Facility B and Facility C have a final maturity date of
September 30, 2028.

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement, we applied for, and were awarded, a repayment
grant (Tilgungszuschuss) of €7,109,999.85 with regard to Facility A funded from resources of the German Ministry of
Economics and Technology (BMWi) on the repayment of all amounts borrowed under Facility A (each a “KfW Repayment
**Grant”). The amount of the KfW Repayment Grant was offset against the repayment instalments with regard to Facility**
A falling due after the date on which the KfW Repayment Grant was granted. The amount of the KfW Repayment Grant
was offset against the repayment instalments with regard to Facility A in inverse chronological order, i.e., beginning with
the repayment instalment for the last repayment date with regard to the Facility A.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loan outstanding under the
Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement by giving ten business days' prior notice to the agent and provided
KfW has consented to any voluntary prepayment of a loan under Facility A (but if in part, being an amount that reduces
the amount of such loan by a minimum amount of €5.0 million or the remainder).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement require mandatory

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice to the agent under
the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement describing the transaction or transactions that constituted the
Change of Control and offer to repay each lender's participation in any loans and to cancel each lender’s Commitment
under the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement in the loans on the date specified in such notice (the “Change
**of Control Offer”) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed**
(the “Change of Control Repayment Date”) but no later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other
senior secured debt. Pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, each lender under the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities
Agreement will have the right to require us to prepay all or any part of the principal amount of such lender's participation
in the loans plus break costs determined by each lender in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an
amount requested from such lender by KfW, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts
accrued under the finance documents, whereupon the Commitments of the lender will be canceled.

“Change of Control”, for purposes of the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement, means the occurrence of
the following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company), the Issuer
becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in Section
2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares;


-----

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding company), the Issuer

becoming aware of (i) any “person” or “group” of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in
Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a permitted shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 30% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the
issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares than
such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or consolidation or other

business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or substantially all of the

assets of the Issuer; or

(v) the Issuer ceases to hold (directly or indirectly) 100% of the shares in Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility A will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.3% per annum. All borrowings under the Facility
B and the Facility C will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.3% per annum.

We were also required to pay a commitment fee in arrear on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 30 at a
rate of 0.25% per month with regard to any available but unused commitments in relation to the Facility A during the period
starting on the date falling one day after August 10, 2019, until the last day of the relevant availability period.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that closely track those
contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement required us to
submit to KfW, via the agent under the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement, certain use of funds certificates
(Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that we have made use of the funds borrowed under the Facility A in
accordance with the specified purpose described above and relevant KfW program rules. Furthermore, we are required to
procure that the investment measures implemented with the borrowings under the Facility A are operated in accordance
with their designated purpose for a period of at least five (5) years (the “Minimum Operating Period”), and during the
Minimum Operating Period, no part of the relevant investments may, subject to the principle of proportionality, be
abandoned or sold-off (unless the further operation in accordance with the designated purpose is safeguarded).

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement, our relationship with the
lenders with regard to Facility A is also governed by the general terms and conditions of KfW, which are incorporated into
the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement by reference. In case of any conflict between the provisions of the
Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement and the general terms and conditions of KfW, the provisions of the
general terms and conditions of KfW will prevail in relation to the Facility A. In particular, in addition to the customary
events of the default contained in the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement, the general terms and conditions
of KfW also contain certain bespoke termination rights related to the quasi-governmental nature of the subsidized funding
provided by KfW, through Commerzbank AG, under the Facility A.

**SENIOR SECURED ERSTE GROUP BANK FACILITY AGREEMENT**

The Issuer may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loans made available to it under the Senior Secured Erste
Group Bank Facility Agreement by giving not less than five business days' notice (or such shorter period as the majority
lenders may agree) to the agent (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the amount of the loan by a minimum of €1.0
million or the remainder if the outstanding loan is less than €1.0 million).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to
perform any of its obligations under the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement. The Senior Secured Erste
Group Bank Facility Agreement also provides for a voluntary cancellation, upon a three business days’ notice, of the whole
or any part (being a minimum amount of €1.0 million or the remainder if the commitments are less than €1.0 million) of
the Facility.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice to the agent under
the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement describing the transaction or transactions that constituted the
Change of Control and offer to repay each lender's participation in any loans under the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank
Facility Agreement in the loans and to cancel each lender's commitment on the date specified in such notice (the “Change
**of Control Offer”) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed**
(the “Change of Control Repayment Date”) but no later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other
senior secured debt. Pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, each lender under the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank
Facility Agreement will have the right to require the Issuer to prepay such lender's participation in the loans together with
accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts accrued under the finance documents in respect of any such
participation in any such loans on the Change of Control Prepayment Date, whereupon the commitment of that lender will
be cancelled.

“Change of Control”, for purposes of the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement, means the occurrence of
the following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company), the Issuer
becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in Section
2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares;


-----

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding company), the Issuer

becoming aware of (i) any “person” or “group” of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in
Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a permitted shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 30% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the
issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares than
such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or consolidation or other

business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder;

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or substantially all of the

assets of the Issuer; or

(v) the Issuer ceases to hold (directly or indirectly) 100% of the shares in Progroup AG.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement bears an interest rate per annum equal to EURIBOR plus margin.
The initial margin in respect of any loan is 1.85 per cent per annum. Following September 30, 2019 the margin for each
loan will be determined by reference to the consolidated net leverage ratio as set out below:

**Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio** **Margin per cent per annum**

Greater than 3.50:1 ................................................................................................. 2.60

Equal to or less than 3.50:1..................................................................................... 1.85

Any such increase or decrease in the margin for a loan shall take effect on the date which is three business days after receipt
by the agent of a relevant compliance certificate and if and for so long as the relevant compliance certificate is not delivered
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement, the margin for
each loan will be the highest percentage per annum set out above.

We were also required to pay a commitment fee in arrear at the end of each calendar quarter at a rate per annum which is
equal to 35 per cent of the margin on the available commitments from the signing date to the end of the availability period.

**SENIOR SECURED LBBW FACILITIES AGREEMENT**

On May 31, 2019, the Issuer as company, borrower and original guarantor, and the other Guarantors as original guarantors
entered into a euro-denominated senior secured facilities agreement (the “Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement”)
with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg as agent and original lender. The Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement
provides for €30,000,000 of total committed credit, including (i) a €15 million term loan facility (“Facility A”) and a €15.0
million term loan facility (“Facility B”). Facility A is refinanced by funds made available by KfW under a certain KfW
program that offers subsidized funding for eligible investments that promote energy efficiency. The Senior Secured LLB
Facilities Agreement was subsequently amended on June 24, 2019 to reduce the margin applicable to Facility B and on
July 8, 2020 to extend the availability period and amend the repayment schedule with regards to Facility A.

The purposes of the borrowings under the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement was to fund certain eligible
investments in connection with the proposed establishment and/or startup of a corrugated board plant. Borrowings under
Facility B could also be used for the financing or refinancing of investments or costs in connection with other investment
projects of the Group or the general corporate purposes of the Group.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Facility A has a final maturity date of June 30, 2029 and the Facility B has a final maturity date of June 30, 2029.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of the loan outstanding under the
Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement by giving not less than ten business days' notice (or such shorter period as the
majority lenders may agree) (and provided that KfW has consented to any such a voluntary prepayment of any Facility A
Loans) to the agent (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the amount of the loan by a minimum of €1 million or the
remainder if the outstanding loan is less than €1 million).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement require mandatory cancellation and,
if applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its
obligations under the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice to the agent under
the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement describing the transaction or transactions that constituted the Change of
Control and offer to repay each lender's participation in any loans and to cancel each lender’s Commitment under the Senior
Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement in the loans on the date specified in such notice (the “Change of Control Offer”)
which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Change of
**Control Repayment Date”) but no later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other senior secured**
debt. Pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, each lender under the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement will have


-----

the right to require us to repay such lender’s participation in any loans together with break costs determined by each lender
in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an amount requested from such lender by KfW, plus, in
each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts accrued under the finance documents, whereupon the
Commitments of the lender will be canceled in respect of an such participation in any such loans on the Change of Control
Repayment Date.

“Change of Control”, for purposes of the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement, means the occurrence of the
following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company), the Issuer
becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in Section
2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding company), the Issuer

becoming aware of (i) any “person” or “group” of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in
Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a permitted shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 30% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the
issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares than
such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or consolidation or other

business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or substantially all of the

assets of the Issuer.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility A will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per annum and all borrowings under the
Facility B will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per annum.

We were also required to pay a commitment fee in arrear on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 30 (i)
in relation to the Facility A, at a rate of 0.25% per month on the available commitments in relation to Facility A for the
period starting on November, 28, 2019; (ii) and in relation to Facility B, at a rate of 0.55 per cent per annum on the available
commitments in relation to Facility B for the period starting on the date falling two months after the date of the agreement.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that closely track those
contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement required us to submit
to KfW, via the agent under the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement, certain use of funds certificates
(Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that we have made use of the funds borrowed under the Facility A in
accordance with the specified purpose described above and relevant KfW program rules.

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement, our relationship with the lenders under
the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement is in case of Facility A also governed by the general terms and conditions
of KfW, which are incorporated into the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement by reference. In case of any conflict
between the provisions of the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement and the general terms and conditions of KfW,
the provisions of the general terms and conditions of KfW will prevail in relation to Facility A. In particular, in addition to
the customary events of the default contained in the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement, the general terms and

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loan outstanding under the
Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement by giving ten business days’ prior notice to the agent (but if in part,
being an amount that reduces the amount of such loan by a minimum amount of EUR 5 million or the remainder).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to
perform any of its obligations under the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice to the agent under
the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement describing the transaction or transactions that constituted the
Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation in any loans and to cancel each lender’s Commitment
under the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement in the loans on the date specified in such notice (the “Change
**of Control Offer”) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed**
(the “Change of Control Repayment Date”) but no later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other
senior secured debt. Pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, each lender under the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility
Agreement will have the right to require us to repay such lender’s participation in any loans together with break costs
determined by each lender in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an amount requested from such
lender by KfW, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts accrued under the finance
documents in respect of any such participation in any such loans on the Change of Control Repayment Date, whereupon
the commitments of that lender will be cancelled.

“Change of Control”, for purposes of the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement, means the occurrence of
the following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company), the Issuer
becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in Section
2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding company), the Issuer

becoming aware of (i) any “person” or “group” of persons acting in concert in the meaning given to such term in
Section 2 paragraph 5 of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und
_Übernahmegesetz) other than a permitted shareholder acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control_
over more than 30% issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than
number of shares and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the
issued and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares than
such other person or group;


-----

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or consolidation or other

business combination transaction), in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or substantially all of the

assets of the Issuer.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.95% per annum.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrear on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 30 at a
rate of 0.15% per month with regard to any available but unused commitments in relation to the Facility during the period
starting on March 1, 2024, until the last day of the availability period.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that closely track those
contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement requires us to
submit to KfW, via the agent under the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement, certain use of funds certificates
(Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that we have made use of the funds borrowed under the Facility, as
applicable, in accordance with the specified purpose described above and relevant KfW program rules.

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement, our relationship with the
lenders under the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement is also governed by the general terms and conditions
of KfW, which are incorporated into the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement by reference. In case of any
conflict between the provisions of the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement and the general terms and
conditions of KfW, the provisions of the general terms and conditions of KfW will prevail. In particular, in addition to the
customary events of the default contained in the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement, the general terms and
conditions of KfW also contain certain bespoke termination rights related to the quasi-governmental nature of the
subsidized funding provided by KfW under the Senior Secured IKB-DZ BANK Facility Agreement.

**INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT**

On April 29, 2015, the Issuer, the then-existing Guarantors, JH-Holding, the Security Agent and others entered into an
intercreditor agreement (as amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Intercreditor Agreement”) to govern the
relationships and relative priorities among (i) certain then-existing secured creditors of the Group; (ii) future hedge
counterparties under certain hedging agreements (the “Hedge Counterparties”); (iii) future cash management providers,
(iv) certain future creditors of the Group that may accede to the Intercreditor Agreement from time to time, (v) certain intra
group creditors and debtors; (vi) various creditor representatives; and (vii) the Security Agent. All Guarantors that were
not an original party to the Intercreditor Agreement have subsequently acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement, and
Progroup Power 2 GmbH will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in connection with the Refinancing.

The Issuer, the Guarantors and each of their subsidiaries that incur any liability or provides any guarantee or security under
the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements or the Notes and related documents or any Pari Passu Debt Documents are
together referred to in this description as “Debtors”.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for accession by certain additional Pari Passu Debt Creditors (as defined below)
and/or their representatives. The agents under all Senior Secured Facilities Agreements acceeded as creditors’
representatives after the original signing date of the Intercreditor Agreement, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the
lenders under such Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, and TMF Trustee Services GmbH, as holders’ representative on
behalf of the holders of the Notes, will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in connection with the Refinancing. The
Notes will constitute Additional Indebtedness (as defined below) for purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and will
therefore be permitted to share in the transaction security that secures (or will secure, as applicable) the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreements and any other Pari Passu Debt (as defined below). As a result, holders of the Notes will have
equivalent rights to the lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements under the Intercreditor Agreement and may
vote in the same class of creditors as the lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements in respect of enforcement.

On May 2, 2018, we entered into an amendment and restatement agreement relating to the Intercreditor Agreement. In
addition to various technical amendments, we amended and restated the definition of “Credit Facility” and related terms in
the Intercreditor Agreement to include, in addition to our former super senior revolving credit facility, certain credit


-----

facilities which are permitted by the terms of the Pari Passu Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
to share pari passu in the Collateral with the rights and obligation of Super Senior Credit Facility Lenders (as defined in
the Intercreditor Agreement) as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement, and in respect of which the creditors, facility
agent, and arrangers have acceded as Super Senior Credit Facility Lenders, Super Senior Credit Facility Agent or Super
Senior Credit Facility Creditors (as the case may be, and each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and which are
permitted to receive priority to the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (as defined below) with respect to the proceeds of any
enforcement of the Collateral (such credit facilities, together with the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, together the
“Super Senior Credit Facilities” and each a “Super Senior Credit Facility”). As a result, the total amount of
Indebtedness under a Super Senior Credit Facility that may be secured by Liens on a super priority basis is currently capped
at €80 million under the terms of our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (see “Senior Secured Revolving
_Credit Facility Agreement—Covenants” above). In addition, we amended and restated the Intercreditor Agreement to_
increase the Priority Hedging Limit (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement to up to €80 million.

Following the completion of the Refinancing, we intend to enter into a further amendment and restatement agreement
relating to the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition to various technical amendments that will not adversely affect the
Holders in any material respect, we intend to amend and restate the Intercreditor Agreement to (i) insert a formal mechanism
for the resignation of Secured Creditors (as defined under the Intercreditor Agreement) as parties to the Intercreditor
Agreement following the termination and discharge in full of the Primary Finance Documents (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to which they originally became Secured Creditors, (ii) delete references to the old super
senior revolving credit facility of the Group that was terminated in 2023, (iii) amend the definition of “Credit Facility” in
the intercreditor agreement to“Super Senior Credit Facility” in order to reflect the deviating usage of such term in the
Conditions of Issue that will govern the Notes and the covenant schedules of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and
(iv) provide for a mechanism that permits the granting of Security in favor of Pari Passu Debt Creditors (or their affiliates)
which make available ancillary facilities pursuant to the terms of a Pari Passu Debt Document (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement). In the 2024 Facility Amendment Agreements, the finance parties under the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreements also agreed to execute and/or instruct the relevant facility agents and the Security Agent to execute,
at the request of the Issuer, one or more amendment and restatement agreements to the Intercreditor Agreement so the
Intercreditor Agreement will be so amended and restated. Similarly, the Conditions of Issue that will govern the Notes will
provide, that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the holders’ representative in relation to the Notes,
the Security Agent or any holder of the Notes, the holders’ representative in relation to the Notes and the Security Agent
shall enter into the proposed amendment and restatement agreement to the Intercreditor Agreement. The following
description of certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement summarizes the relevant provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement as so amended and restated. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe
provisions relating to the rights and obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read the
Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines the rights of the holders of the Notes.

**_General_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, among other things, sets out:

  - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

  - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

  - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

  - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency
events;

  - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of the transaction security;

  - turnover provisions; and

  - when the transaction security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to indebtedness incurred by the Debtors that is permitted by the
terms of the Notes and the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, which ranks pari passu to the Notes and the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreements and is secured by the Collateral (the “Pari Passu Debt”, the liabilities of the Debtors in
respect thereof, the “Pari Passu Debt Liabilities”, the creditors thereof, the “Pari Passu Debt Creditors” and all
documents or instruments entered into between any Debtors and a Pari Passu Debt Creditor setting out the terms of any
credit facility, notes, indenture or debt security which creates or evidences and Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the “Pari Passu


-----

**Debt Documents”), subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement allows for a**
refinancing in full or in part of the Notes as Additional Indebtedness (as defined below).

**_Ranking and Priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to the provisions regarding permitted payments, that the right and priority
of payment of all present and future liabilities and obligations under any Super Senior Credit Facilities (the “Super Senior
**Credit Facility Liabilities”), any hedging agreements entered into by the Hedge Counterparties (the “Hedging**
**Liabilities”), the Notes (the “Notes Liabilities”), certain liabilities owed by any member of the Restricted Group (as**
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in respect of cash management and treasury services provided by a cash
management provider which has become a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (a “Cash Management Provider” and the
liabilities owed to such Cash Management Providers, the “Cash Management Liabilities”), all present and future
liabilities and obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements (the “Senior Secured Facility Liabilities”) and
certain other liabilities will rank in right and priority of payment in the following order:

  - first, any Super Senior Credit Facility Liabilities, any Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the liabilities
owed in respect of the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, any other Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the Cash
Management Liabilities, the creditor representative liabilities and the liabilities owed to the Security Agent and
_pari passu and without any preference between them; and_

  - second, certain intercompany obligations of the Debtors to the Issuer and its subsidiaries (the “Intra-Group
**Liabilities”) and liabilities owed by any Debtor to the Parent and possibly other structural creditors (the**
“Structural Liabilities” and together with the Intercompany Debt, the “Subordinated Liabilities”).

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the Subordinated Liabilities among themselves.

**_Transaction Security_**

The creditors under any Super Senior Credit Facilities (the “Super Senior Credit Facilities Creditors”), any Hedge
Counterparties, the holders of the Notes, the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, any other Pari Passu
Debt Creditors, the Cash Management Providers, the creditor representatives and the Security Agent (together, the
“Secured Parties”) benefit from the transaction security (which, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, includes
a guarantee granted by the Parent recourse under which shall be limited to the value of the enforcement proceeds of the
security provided are shares of the Issuer and are pledged by the Parent). Subject to the order of application of proceeds
(see “Application of Proceeds” below), the transaction security shall rank and secure any Super Senior Credit Facility
Liabilities, any Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the Cash Management Liabilities,
the creditor representative liabilities and the liabilities owed to the Security Agent _pari passu and without preference_
between them. Neither Ancillary Lenders nor Hedge Counterparties nor Cash Management Providers may take the benefit
of any guarantee or security from members of the Group (other than customary security for ancillary lenders and hedge
counterparties) unless such guarantee or security is also offered (to the extent legally possible) for the benefit of the other
Secured Parties. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the guarantees and transaction security will be
released in certain circumstances described further below in “—Release of Security—Non distressed Disposals” and “—
_Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals”._

**_Permitted Payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits payments to be made by the Debtors under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements,
the Notes and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents (provided such payments are permitted under those documents). The
Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments to creditors of Intra-Group Liabilities, provided that there has been no
acceleration event in respect of any Super Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, the Notes or
any other Pari Passu Debt (subject to exceptions). No payments may be made in respect of Structural Liabilities except as
permitted by any Super Senior Credit Facilities Agreements, the Senior Secured Facilities, the Conditions of Issue and any
other Pari Passu Debt Documents or if the required majority of each class of debt has consented. There are also restrictions
on payments to Hedge Counterparties subject to except certain specified permitted payments.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

For the purposes of enforcement, any Super Senior Credit Facility Creditors, any Hedge Counterparty to the extent of their
Priority Hedging Liabilities and the Cash Management Providers are referred to as the “Super Senior Creditors”. Hedging
Liabilities may be designated as Priority Hedging Liabilities if they are in relation to foreign currency hedging and/or
interest rate hedging and the designated mark-to-market amount in respect of those Hedging Liabilities does not exceed an
aggregate amount of €80,000,000 (the “Priority Hedging Limit”).


-----

If the transaction security has become enforceable and any of the Super Senior Creditors, the holders of the Notes (acting
through the relevant holders’ representative), the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements or any other
Pari Passu Debt Creditors wish to enforce the transaction security, either (a) the Majority Super Senior Creditors or (b) the
Majority Pari Passu Creditors must give notice of the proposed instructions as to enforcement (the “Shared Security
**Notice”) to the creditor representatives for the other creditor classes and the Security Agent. The giving of this notice**
triggers a 30 day consultation period during which time the creditor representatives for each of the creditor classes must
discuss the proposals in good faith with a view to formulating joint enforcement. During the consultation period, but subject
to certain exceptions, the Secured Parties may not accelerate their respective Liabilities owed to them under the Debt
Documents nor closeout any hedging transactions.

The “Majority Super Senior Creditors” means those Super Senior Creditors whose participations in the Super Senior
Credit Facility Liabilities, terminated Priority Hedging Liabilities and Cash Management Liabilities exceed 66[2]/3 per cent
Of the aggregate participations in any Super Senior Credit Facility Liabilities, Priority Hedging Liabilities and Cash
Management Liabilities. The “Majority Pari Passu Creditors” means a simple majority of the aggregate of (i) the
outstanding principal amount of a combined class of holders of the Pari Passu Debt Creditors (including holders of the
Notes and the creditors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and (ii) the outstanding amount owed by any Debtor to
the non-priority hedge counterparties.

A creditor representative is not obliged to consult as described above (or shall only be obliged to consult for a shorter
period) if:

  - an insolvency event has occurred and is continuing in relation to a Debtor;

  - an event of default is continuing in relation to liabilities owed to the relevant creditor group and that creditor group
(acting in good faith) determines, and notifies the creditor representatives, that to do so and thereby delay
enforcement could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the Security Agent’s ability to
enforce any of the transaction security; or (B) the realization proceeds available to that creditor group of any
enforcement of the transaction security in any material respect; or

  - the creditor representatives so agree.

**_Conflicting Enforcement Instructions_**

At the end of the consultation period, the Security Agent shall act on the instructions of the Instructing Group. If the
Security Agent does not receive any instructions from the Instructing Group as to enforcement following the consultation
period, the Security Agent shall take no action. The Instructing Group consists of (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors
and (ii) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, in each case acting through their creditor representatives. If there are conflicting
enforcement instructions given to the Security Agent by the different classes of creditors who can constitute the Instructing
Group (or if a creditor representative of a class of creditors fails to give instructions), then provided that the Majority Pari
Passu Creditors have complied with the consultation obligations in the Intercreditor Agreement and those instructions are
consistent with the security enforcement principles (see further below), the instructions as to enforcement from the Majority
Pari Passu Creditors will prevail over those of the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu Creditors
will constitute the Instructing Group.

If (a) the Security Agent has not taken any enforcement action within 3 months of the date of the first shared security notice
was issued; (b) the Super Senior Creditors have not been repaid in full in cash within 6 months of the date the first Shared
Security Notice was issued; or (c) an insolvency event occurs in respect of a Debtor and the Security Agent has not
commenced enforcement, any enforcement instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will then prevail,
provided that they are consistent with the security enforcement principles.

Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain security enforcement principles which include:

  - achieving the security enforcement objective, which is to maximize, so far as is consistent with the prompt and
expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the transaction security, the recoveries of all Secured Parties;

  - all enforcement proceeds will be received in cash by the Security Agent or sufficient enforcement proceeds will
be received in cash by the Security Agent to ensure that after distribution in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Super Senior Credit Facility Liabilities, Priority Hedging Liabilities and Cash Management
Liabilities will be repaid and discharged in full;

  - all enforcement action must be prompt and expeditious and reasonably expected to realize proceeds from
enforcement within six months of receipt by the Security Agent of initial enforcement instructions;


-----

  - to the extent that the enforcement is over transaction security with an aggregate book value exceeding €5,000,000
(or its equivalent) or over all of the shares in a member of the restricted group which are secured, the Security
Agent shall obtain an opinion from a “big four” accounting firm, a recognized independent investment bank or
other reputable independent third party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of the
relevant type and size of assets, as to whether the amount received in connection with such enforcement is fair
from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances (the “Financial Advisor Opinion”);

  - the Financial Advisor Opinion will be conclusive evidence that the security enforcement objective and the security
enforcement principles have been met; and

  - if the enforcement is by way of public auction, no Financial Advisor Opinion is required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exclusions, if any Super Senior Credit Facility Creditor, Pari Passu Debt Creditor, Hedge Counterparty
(or any of their respective creditor representatives), a Cash Management Provider or the Holders’ Representative receives
or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any transaction security, except in accordance with “—Application of
_Proceeds” below, that person must:_

  - in relation to amounts not received or recovered by way of set off, hold that amount (net of third party costs and
taxes) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay an amount equal to that amount (net of third party costs
and taxes) to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

  - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set off, promptly pay an amount equal to
that recovery (net of third party costs and taxes) to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

There is also a general turnover obligation on the subordinated creditors to turnover to the Security Agent all amounts
which are not permitted payments made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent as Enforcement Proceeds (as defined under the
Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions
described under this paragraph shall be held on trust by the Security Agent and applied at any time as the Security Agent
(in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by law, in the following order:

  - first, in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any delegate;

  - second, pari passu and pro rata, to each creditor representative, including all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with any enforcement;

  - third, pari passu and pro rata, in payment to the creditor representative of the Lenders for application towards the
discharge of any Super Senior Credit Facility Liabilities, to the arrangers of any Super Senior Credit Facilities,
the Hedge Counterparties in respect of their Priority Hedging Liabilities and the Cash Management Providers;

  - fourth, pari passu and pro rata, in payment to (i) the respective paying agent on behalf of the holders of the Notes
for application towards the discharge of the Notes Liabilities in accordance with the Notes Documents; (ii) the
creditor representatives of the other Pari Passu Debt Creditors for application towards the discharge of the other
Pari Passu Debt; and (iii) the Hedge Counterparties for application towards the discharge of the non priority
hedging obligations;

  - fifth, in payment to any person the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor; and

  - sixth, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor.

**_Option to Purchase_**

Any Pari Passu Debt Creditors (including the holders of the Notes and the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreements) may, after an Acceleration Event or an enforcement, and subject to various conditions set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement (including the grant of an acceptable indemnity against clawback to the relevant lenders /
creditors), exercise an option to purchase in full and in cash the Super Senior Credit Facility Liabilities, any Pari Passu


-----

Liabilities incurred to refinance the Super Senior Credit Facility Liabilities in full, any Priority Hedging Liabilities and any
Cash Management Liabilities, at par.

**_Release of Security—Non Distressed Disposals_**

In circumstances where (i) a disposal is not a distressed disposal (i.e., a disposal to a person or persons outside the Group
of an asset by a Debtor which is subject to the transaction security or a disposal of the shares in the capital of any holding
company of a Debtor which is permitted by the terms of any Super Senior Credit Facility, the Conditions of Issue, the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents) or (ii) any transaction pursuant to which
security shall be granted over any asset which is subject to transaction security to a person which is not a secured creditor
and a corresponding release of transaction security is permitted under the terms of any Super Senior Credit Facility, the
Conditions of Issue, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed to deliver:

  - any release of the transaction security and any other claim over that asset;

  - where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, any release of the transaction security and any other
claim over that Debtor’s property and/or the shares in, and property of, any of its subsidiaries; and

issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of
the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable.

**_Release of Security—Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

If a member of the Group is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of each of any Super
Senior Credit Facilities, the Conditions of Issue, the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any other Pari Passu Debt
Documents, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and obliged (at the cost of the relevant debtor and the Issuer and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or debtor):

  - to release the transaction security or any other claim (relating to a debt document) over that member of the Group’s
assets; and

  - to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the transaction security or any claim described in the paragraph
above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may,
in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable or as requested by the Issuer.

**_Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals_**

In circumstances where a distressed disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Security
Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed:

  - to release the transaction security or any other claim over the relevant asset and execute and deliver or enter into
any release of that transaction security, or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge
or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

  - if the asset that is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (i) that Debtor and any
subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and certain other
liabilities; (ii) any transaction security granted over that Debtor’s assets and the assets of any of its subsidiaries;
and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or intra Group lender over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor;

  - if the asset that is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor, to release
(i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part of its borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities and certain other liabilities; (ii) any transaction security granted by that holding
company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets; and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or
intra Group lender over the assets of any holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company;

  - if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of a Debtor,
to dispose of all or any part of that Debtor’s or the holding company that Debtor’s borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities, certain other liabilities, and other intra Group receivables; and


-----

  - if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company of a Debtor,
to transfer Intra Group Liabilities and debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding company of a Debtor to
another Debtor.

Any net proceeds of the disposal must be applied in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall described under
“—Application of Proceeds”.

**_Amendment_**

The Intercreditor Agreement may only be amended with the consent of any Majority Super Senior Creditors, the required
percentage of Pari Passu Debt Creditors (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents), or the written consent of
the creditor representative of the Pari Passu Debt Creditors (acting in accordance with the terms of the relevant Pari Passu
Debt Documents), the Issuer and the Security Agent unless it relates to certain specified matters such as ranking, priority,
turnover, redistribution, enforcement, disposal proceeds, application of enforcement proceeds and security enforcement
principles. Such amendments require consent from all Super Senior Creditors, the holders of the Notes (acting through the
holders’ representative and in accordance with the Conditions of Issue), the other Pari Passu Debt Creditors (including the
lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements), and each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent such amendments
adversely affect it), each Cash Management Provider (to the extent such amendment adversely affects it) and the Security
Agent; provided that where an amendment or waiver only relates to the ranking order of priority or subordination or, or
application of proceeds of enforcement to creditors ranking after any other group of creditors, the consent of such other
group of creditors shall not be required.

No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or
reduce the rights of any party (other than in a way which affects creditors of that party’s class generally) to the Intercreditor
Agreement without the prior consent of that party or in the case of a Debtor, to the extent consented to by the Issuer.

The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended without the consent of the holders of the Notes in certain circumstances. For
more information, see “Description of the Notes—Covenants—Amendment and Restatement of Intercreditor Agreement;
_Additional Intercreditor Agreements”._

To the extent the Debtors wish to enter into additional Pari Passu Debt or other additional or replacement indebtedness
(“Additional Indebtedness”) which is permitted to share in the transaction security pursuant to any Super Senior Credit
Facility, the Conditions of Issue and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents, then the parties to the Intercreditor Agreement
may be required to enter into a replacement intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits the Security Agent (subject to the terms of any Super Senior Credit Facilities
Agreement) to enter into new or supplemental security and/or release and retake transaction security if certain conditions
are met.

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with German law.

**OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

**Forfaiting Program**

Our subsidiary Progroup Board GmbH finances a portion of its trade receivables through an off balance sheet forfaiting
program with CommerzFactoring GmbH. Under the forfaiting program it sells trade receivables to CommerzFactoring
GmbH on a non recourse basis in return for immediate cash payments. The forfaiting transactions occur up to a maximum
aggregate transaction volume of €30 million. As of December 31, 2023, no trade receivables were sold under the forfaiting
program.

Progroup AG, a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) organized under German law (the “Issuer”) will issue
(i) €           aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) and
(ii) €           aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes” and, together with the
2029 Notes, the “Notes”) in accordance with the conditions of issue governing the 2029 Notes (the “2029 Notes Conditions
**of Issue”) and the conditions of issue governing the 2031 Notes (the “2031 Notes Conditions of Issue” and, together with**
the 2029 Notes Conditions of Issue, the “Conditions of Issue”), each to be dated the Issue Date. In this “Description of
_the Notes”, the term “Issuer” refers to Progroup AG only and not to any of its Subsidiaries._

The following describes the material provisions of the Notes, the Conditions of Issue, the Guarantee Agreement, the
Security Documents and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and is subject, and is qualified in its entirety by reference,
to all of the provisions of the Notes, the Conditions of Issue, the Guarantee Agreement, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement. We urge you to read the Conditions of Issue, the Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as holders of the
Notes. Copies of the Conditions of Issue, the Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement are available as set forth under “Available Information”. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in
this description under the subheading “—Certain Definitions”.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will be governed by German law and will:

    - constitute senior obligations of the Issuer;

    - rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not subordinated
in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities, Hedging
Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities;

    - be secured by the Collateral (as defined below) along with obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities,
Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities (but will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the
Collateral (as defined below) only after all obligations secured on a super priority basis, including obligations
under the Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities, have been paid in full);

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

    - rank effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the Issuer, to the
extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined below) that is available to satisfy the obligations of the Issuer
under the Notes;

    - be effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s existing and future secured Indebtedness that is secured by property
or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property or assets securing such
Indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors (as defined below).

**_The Note Guarantees_**

From the Issue Date, the Notes will initially be guaranteed on a senior basis by each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer
which guarantees the Senior Secured Facilities (the “Initial Note Guarantees”). As of the Issue Date, the Notes will be
guaranteed by Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup Logistics GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper
PM2 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH, Progroup Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Power 2 GmbH, Progroup Board s.r.o.,
Progroup Board sp. z o.o. and Progroup Board Ltd. (each an “Initial Guarantor” and such entities collectively the “Initial
**Guarantors”).**

With effect of and following the Issue Date, the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, guarantee by way of an independent
payment obligation (selbständiges Zahlungsversprechen) unconditionally and irrevocably, on (subject to the limitations
set out below) a senior basis, the full and punctual payment of all amounts payable under the Notes when due. The Note
Guarantees will be agreed in a separate agreement to be entered into among Wilmington Trust (London) Limited, as
Security Agent, and each Initial Guarantor (the “Guarantee Agreement”) on or prior to the Issue Date.

The Note Guarantees will not constitute contracts for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the Holders’ Representative
(as defined below) from time to time as third party beneficiaries in accordance with Section 328(1) of the German Civil
Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) and will not give rise to the right of each holder of any Notes or the Holders’
Representative to require performance of the Note Guarantees directly from the Guarantors and to enforce the Note


-----

Guarantees directly against the Guarantors. A copy of the Guarantee Agreement may be inspected and obtained free of
charge at the principal office of the Paying Agent during normal business hours.

The Issuer may from time to time be required to procure from certain of its Subsidiaries (each, an “Additional Guarantor”,
and collectively with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”) the issuance of additional guarantees pursuant to the
provisions set forth under “—Covenants—Future Guarantors” below. Any such guarantee (an “Additional Note
**Guarantee” and, together with the Initial Note Guarantees, the “Note Guarantees”) shall be issued on substantially the**
same terms as the Initial Note Guarantees and be subject to limitations and restrictions as set forth under “—Covenants—
_Future Guarantors”. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject_
_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_its validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

The term “Note Guarantees” shall also include any such Additional Note Guarantees and the term “Guarantors” shall
also include any such Additional Guarantors.

The obligations under the Note Guarantees issued by Guarantors will be limited as necessary under the terms of such Note
Guarantees to prevent the Note Guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable laws, or otherwise
to reflect limitations under applicable laws, including with respect to maintenance of share capital and other applicable
statutory provisions. The Note Guarantees may be subject to claims that they should be subordinated or voided in favor of
our existing and future creditors under capital maintenance and other laws in Germany and other relevant jurisdictions.

Subject to the above, the Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

    - constitute direct, unconditional and irrevocable senior obligations of such Guarantor;

    - rank equal in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future obligations that are not
subordinated in right of payment to the relevant Note Guarantee, including obligations under the Senior
Secured Facilities, Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities;

    - be secured by the Collateral along with its obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities, Hedging
Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities (but will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the
Collateral only after all obligations secured on a super priority basis, including its obligations under the
Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities, have been paid in full);

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the relevant
Guarantor;

    - effectively rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the relevant
Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations of the relevant
Guarantor under the applicable Note Guarantee;

    - effectively rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligations of the relevant Guarantor
secured on the Collateral on a basis junior to the Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is
available to satisfy the obligations under the applicable Note Guarantee;

    - be subject to limitations, risks and qualifications described herein and in “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”;_

    - be effectively subordinated to such Guarantor’s existing and future secured Indebtedness that is secured by
property or assets that do not secure the Guarantee of such Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such
property or assets securing such Indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness (including obligations to trade creditors)
of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

As of the Issue Date, not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and we may establish further
Subsidiaries in the future that will not guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization
of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade
creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or any Guarantor. As of and for the year
ended December 31, 2023, the Issuer and the Guarantors accounted, on a consolidated basis, for 88.4% of the consolidated
revenues (effects of intragroup transactions eliminated), approximately 98% of our EBITDA (effects of intragroup
transactions eliminated) and approximately 95% of the consolidated total assets (effects of intragroup relations eliminated).
The operations of the Issuer are conducted, through a significant extent, through its Subsidiaries and, therefore the Issuer
depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The Notes
will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including
trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. See “Risks Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor_
_subsidiaries”._


-----

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may, without the consent of the Holders, issue additional 2029 Notes (the “Additional 2029 Notes”) or
additional 2031 Notes (the “Additional 2031 Notes” and, together with the Additional 2029 Notes, the “Additional
**Notes”) under the relevant Conditions of Issue from time to time after this offering having the same terms and conditions**
as the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes, as applicable, in all respects (or in all respects except for the issue date, the
commencement of interest payment obligations and/or the issue price). Any issuance of Additional Notes is subject to all
of the covenants in the relevant Conditions of Issue including the covenant described below under “—Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”. The 2029 Notes and any Additional 2029 Notes subsequently issued under the 2029 Notes_
Conditions of Issue will be consolidated with, form a single series with and increase the aggregate principal amount of the
2029 Notes and any Additional 2031 Notes subsequently issued under the 2031 Notes Conditions of Issue will be
consolidated with, form a single series with and increase the aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes; _provided,_
however, that such relevant Additional Notes that are not fungible with the 2029 Notes or 2031 Notes, as applicable, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes shall have a separate common code, ISIN or other identifying number different from the
relevant Notes. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this “Description of the Notes” to the Notes include
the Notes and any Additional Notes that are issued.

**_Principal; Maturity and Interest_**

The Issuer will issue €           aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes and €           aggregate principal
amount of 2031 Notes in this offering. The 2029 Notes will mature on March 31, 2029 (the “2029 Notes Maturity Date”)
at their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the 2029 Notes Maturity
Date. The 2031 Notes will mature on March 31, 2031 (the “2031 Notes Maturity Date”) at their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the 2031 Notes Maturity Date. Each series of Notes will be
issued in denominations of €1,000, which will be transferable only in minimum aggregate principal amounts of €100,000
and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the 2029 Notes will accrue on their outstanding aggregate principal amount at the rate of       %
per annum from and including the Issue Date to but excluding the 2029 Notes Maturity Date and will be payable
semi-annually in arrear on March 31 and September 30 of each year commencing on September 30, 2024. Interest on the
2031 Notes will accrue on their outstanding aggregate principal amount at the rate of       % per annum from and
including the Issue Date to but excluding the 2031 Notes Maturity Date and will be payable semi-annually in arrear on
March 31 and September 30 of each year commencing on September 30, 2024. The Notes shall cease to bear interest at the
end of the day immediately preceding the relevant due date for repayment. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date
of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed
on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

If interest is to be calculated for a period of less than one year (a “Calculation Period”) it shall be calculated on
the basis of the Day Count Fraction. “Day Count Fraction” means with regard to the calculation of interest on any Note
for any Calculation Period the number of days in the Calculation Period divided by 360, the number of days to be calculated
on the basis of a year of 360 days with twelve 30-day months on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding.

A Default shall occur, irrespective of any notice, if any amounts payable under the Notes are not paid when due.
Any due and unpaid amount of principal shall, irrespective of any notice and for so long as such Default remains
outstanding, bear additional default interest at a rate equal to 1% per annum from and including the relevant due date to
but excluding the date of payment.

The rights of Holders of the Notes to receive the payments of interest on the Notes will be subject to the relevant
procedures of Clearstream Banking. If a particular interest payment date is not a Business Day, then the payment date will
move to the next Business Day, and the Holders will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of
any such delay.

**_Methods of receiving payments on the Notes_**

Payments of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes will be made to the Paying
Agent for on-payment to the clearing system or to its order for credit to the respective account holders of the clearing
system and, in case of principal, upon presentation and surrender of the Global Notes. See “—Book-Entry; Delivery and
_Form”. Payments to the clearing system or to its order shall to the extent of amounts so paid constitute the discharge of the_
Issuer from its corresponding liabilities under the Notes. No service charge will be payable for any registration of transfer
or redemption of Notes, but the Issuer may require payment in certain circumstances of a sum sufficient to cover any
transfer tax or other similar governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.


-----

**_Book-entry; Delivery and Form_**

Each series of Notes will be represented by two global notes in bearer form without interest coupons, one of which shall
represent Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in, and in reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act)
(such global notes, the “144A Global Notes”) and the other of which shall represent Notes sold outside the United States
to persons other than U.S. persons as defined in, and in reliance on, Regulation S under the Securities Act (such global
notes, the “Reg S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). Definitive notes
representing individual Notes and interest coupons shall not be issued. The Global Notes will be deposited with Clearstream
Banking. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes, referred to as “book-entry interests”, will be limited to persons that
have accounts with Clearstream Banking (such persons, “participants”) or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Book-entry interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained
in book-entry form by Clearstream Banking and its participants.

Ownership of interests in the book-entry interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer and
certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions”. Book-entry interests
in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form obtainable from the Transfer Agent) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

The Notes represented by the 144A Global Note may be exchanged for Notes represented by the Reg S Global Note and
vice versa, except that no such exchange can be effected in the period starting five Business Days prior to any payment of
principal, interest or any other amount falling due under these Conditions of Issue until (and including) the actual date of
such payment

Any book-entry interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease
to be a book-entry interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and will become a book-entry interest in the
Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

**_Security; Release of Collateral_**

The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will initially be
secured by the Issuer Share Pledges and the payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantors under
the Note Guarantees will be secured by Liens (subject to any Permitted Collateral Liens, applicable perfection requirements
and exceptions and limitations described herein) over the collateral set out below (collectively, with the Issuer Share
Pledges, the “Collateral”):

(a) pledges over the shares and stock interests, as applicable, in Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup Paper
PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH, Progroup Logistics GmbH,
Progroup Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Power 2 GmbH, Progroup Board sp. z o.o., Progroup Board s.r.o.,
Progroup Board S.A.S. and Progroup Board Ltd.;

(b) security interests over receivables of the Parent against the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries;

(c) pledges over certain bank accounts with banks in Germany of the Issuer;

(d) security interests over certain real property located in Germany of Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup
Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH and Progroup Power 1
GmbH, Progroup Power 2 GmbH;

(e) security interests over certain real property located in Poland and the Czech Republic, as applicable, of
Progroup Board s.r.o. and Progroup Board sp. z o.o.;

(f) security interests over certain installations, machines and other business equipment of Progroup
Board GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH
and Progroup Power 1 GmbH; and

(g) security interests over certain installations, machines and other business equipment of, Progroup Board
s.r.o., and Progroup Board sp. z o.o. and Progroup Board Ltd.

The Notes are intended to benefit from the same liens over the Collateral as the Senior Secured Facilities. In order to
address any potential legal uncertainty in certain jurisdictions on this point with regard to certain liens, however, we will


-----

enter into separate confirmation agreements and/or amendment agreements with regard to such liens on or before the Issue
Date. In addition, we will create supplemental and/or additional junior ranking liens over certain assets of the Issuer and
the Guarantors that form part of the Collateral in certain jurisdictions. Such additional liens will secure all the Notes. In
certain jurisdictions, such supplemental and/or additional liens over the Collateral, because they are being granted at a later
point in time, will rank junior to security interests in the Collateral granted in favor of the the Senior Secured Facilities.
However, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the benefit of the first and junior ranking pledges over the Collateral
shall be shared equally among the Holders, the Senior Secured Facility Lenders, the creditors of Hedging Obligations and
the creditors of the Cash Management Liabilities, _provided that any liabilities in respect of obligations under certain_
potential future “Super Senior Credit Facilities” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Priority Hedging Obligations
and Cash Management Liabilities that are secured by assets that also secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and
the Guarantors’ obligations under Note Guarantees will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any
enforcement action over any such assets.

In determining whether and what additional collateral and guarantees may be provided the Agreed Security Principles as
set forth in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will be taken into account. According to such principles,
guarantees shall not be granted and collateral shall not be created, perfected or registered in particular to the extent that it
would be likely to:

    - result in any breach of general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, financial assistance or thin-capitalisation rules or other similar laws or regulations (or analogous
restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction;

    - result in any risk that the directors and officers of the relevant grantor of collateral or guarantees could be
held to be (i) in breach of their fiduciary duties and/or (ii) company or criminal law;

    - result in costs that are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that collateral and
including, but not limited to, the materiality of the proposed collateral in light of the aggregate collateral
already granted; or

    - result in an undue administrative burden on, or material inconvenience to the ordinary course of operations
of the provider of the collateral and the guarantee or prejudice any commercial relationships of such parties.

Furthermore, any assets (other than shares) subject to pre-existing third-party arrangements which are permitted by the
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any
relevant Security Document. Also, no guarantee or security shall be required from any member of the Group that is a joint
venture (where that joint venture is entered into between a member of the Group and an independent third party joint
venture partner) or from any entity in which a member of the Group holds a minority interest and no security will be
required over the shares held by any member of the Group in a joint venture (where that joint venture is entered into
between a member of the Group and an independent third party joint venture partner).

The share pledges, the interest pledges and the account pledges indicated above will be established pursuant to the Security
Documents with the Security Agent acting for the benefit of the Holders and the Senior Secured Facility Lenders. The other
Collateral will be established pursuant to the Security Documents with the Security Agent acting for the benefit of the
Holders and the Senior Secured Facility Lenders being the legal holder of the security interests in the Collateral. Applicable
law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through
certain actions which, in the case of some Collateral, will not be completed until after the Issue Date (including security
interests over certain real property which perfection requirements will be satisfied only until after the Issue Date).

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, if machinery, other equipment or real property are acquired by the Issuer or any
Guarantor that is not automatically subject to a perfected security interest under the Security Documents and which will be
subject to a security interest in favor of the Senior Secured Facility Lenders, then (to the extent the security interest is not
already granted in favor of the Security Agent for the Holders) the Issuer or such Guarantor will within three months, with
respect to acquired machinery or other equipment, and within six months, with respect to acquired real property, provide
security over such assets in favor of the Security Agent. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, no security shall be
granted in favor of the Security Agent or the Holders over any such assets which are subject to any Liens granted or created
in accordance with clauses (13)(b), (15), (23), (29), (30) or (31) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”.

The Security Agent will (i) release the Liens over the shares, property and other assets constituting Collateral in accordance
with the terms provided therefor in the relevant Conditions of Issue, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement and (ii) at the request of the Issuer, a Guarantor or another security provider upon having received an Officers’
Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel certifying compliance with this paragraph, release the relevant Collateral or
execute such other appropriate instrument evidencing such release (in the form provided by and at the expense of the Issuer
or the relevant security provider) under one or more of the following circumstances (without any such release requiring the
consent of the Holders’ Representative or the Holders):


-----

(a) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such property or
assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition does not
violate the provisions described under “—Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets” below and is
otherwise in compliance with the relevant Conditions of Issue;

(b) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the relevant
Conditions of Issue, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor which was
part of the Collateral;

(c) if the Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary as permitted
under and in compliance with the relevant Conditions of Issue, the release of the property, assets and
Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(d) upon redemption of all the Notes;

(e) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Notes as provided below under “—Legal
_Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance”;_

(f) in connection with an enforcement action taken by certain secured creditors of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(g) as provided for under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(h) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under “—Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”;_

(i) with respect to any property or assets that become Collateral securing the Notes and/or any Note
Guarantee pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the covenant “—Limitation on Liens”, upon the release and
discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of the Initial Lien (as defined below), to the
extent that such Lien does not secure any other Indebtedness on a pari passu basis in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(j) with respect to the Issuer Share Pledges and any Collateral consisting of the type of assets listed under
clauses (b), (e), (f) and (g) of the definition of “Collateral” set out above, upon the release and discharge
(other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) over
such Collateral securing Indebtedness, so long as no Event of Default exists at such time or would arise
as a result of such release;

(k) with respect to any Collateral (other than the Issuer Share Pledges and any Collateral consisting of the
type of assets listed under clauses (b), (e), (f) and (g) of the definition of “Collateral” set out above), upon
the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens) over such Collateral securing Indebtedness, so long as no Event of Default exists
at such time or would arise as a result of such release; provided that at the time of such release a Rating
Triggering Period is in effect;

(l) as provided for in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(m) in connection with the granting or creation of any Liens on assets or property in accordance with
clauses (13)(b), (15), (23), (29), (30) or (31) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”; provided that if the
relevant Collateral constitutes real property, (i) the relevant real property or portion of real property
constitutes un-built land without any building constructed thereon; (ii) the Security Agent shall only be
required to release the Liens on a portion of the real property as reasonably required (as determined in
good faith by the Issuer’s Board of Directors) for the realization of the relevant project; and (iii) any
division of real property, if applicable, shall not materially impair the value of the portion of the remaining
real property (as determined in good faith by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); provided further that the
Security Agent shall take any other actions reasonably requested by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
to permit the creation of first-ranking Liens over the relevant assets or property in accordance with
clauses (13)(b), (15), (23), (29), (30) or (31) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”, including by
facilitating the division of any relevant real property into separate parcels.


-----

The Security Agent shall be entitled to accept such Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient
evidence of compliance with this paragraph, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The Security Agent will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and
the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Holders’ Representative.

The creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and the Holders’ Representative, in its own name and on
behalf of the Holders, appointed Wilmington Trust (London) Limited, as Security Agent, to act as their agent and security
trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to:

(a) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to them
under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights,
power and discretions;

(b) execute each Security Document on their behalf and any waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or
replacement permitted by the relevant Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(c) administer and enforce any security interest with respect to any Collateral, subject to the terms and
conditions and limitations contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer under its financing arrangements, including without limitation, the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreements, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash
Management Liabilities, will be governed by the Intercreditor Agreement, originally dated April 29, 2015, between, among
others, the Issuer, the Guarantors (other than Progroup Power PM2 GmbH) and the Security Agent (as amended and/or
restated from time to time). The Intercreditor Agreement provides for accession by additional Debtors (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) and for the accession by certain additional Pari Passu Debt Creditors and additional Debtors (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and/or their representatives. The finance parties under the Senior Secured Facilities
Agreements have entered into creditor/creditor representative accession agreements with regard to the Senior Secured
Facilities Agreements, as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, and we expect TMF Trustee Services GmbH, as
holders’ representative on behalf of the holders of the 2029 Notes and as holders’ representative on behalf of the holders
of the 2031 Notes, and Progroup Power 2 GmbH, as a Guarantor, will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on the Issue
Date. The Notes will constitute Additional Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) for purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement and will therefore be permitted to share in the Collateral that also secures (or will secure, as
applicable) obligations under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreements and any other Pari Passu Debt Liabilities. Following
the redemption in full of the Existing Notes with a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the Notes, we intend to
enter into an amendment and restatement agreement relating to the Intercreditor Agreement as described under
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement (as so further amended and restated), any liabilities in respect of obligations under certain “Super Senior Credit
Facilities” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities that
are secured by assets that also secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Guarantors’ obligations under Note
Guarantees will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets.
Any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any Collateral, after all obligations under any “Super Senior
Credit Facilities” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management
Liabilities, as well as all obligations owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or delegate have been repaid from such
recoveries, will be applied pro rata in repayment of all obligations under the relevant Conditions of Issue and the Notes
and any other Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) of the Issuer and the Guarantors
permitted to be Incurred and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the relevant Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**Release of Note Guarantees**

A Note Guarantee shall be released and discharged, automatically, unconditionally and without further action on the part
of the Security Agent:

(a) in the case of a Note Guarantee of a Guarantor, in the event of any sale, exchange, assignment, transfer
conveyance or other disposition (including by merger or otherwise) (i) of the Capital Stock of a
Guarantor, after which the applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) of all or
substantially all the assets of such Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect
to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each of sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of this


-----

clause (a), which sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition is permitted
under, and made in compliance with, the relevant Conditions of Issue;

(b) upon the release of the Guarantee of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the relevant Note
Guarantee under the covenant described below under “—Covenants—Future Guarantors” so long as no
Event of Default would arise as a result and no other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor at that
time is Guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor;

(c) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance as provided below under “—Legal Defeasance or
_Covenant Defeasance”;_

(d) upon redemption of all the Notes;

(e) if the Issuer designates a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary as permitted under and in compliance
with the relevant Conditions of Issue;

(f) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents;

(g) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under “—Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation”;_

(h) as provided for under “—Amendments and Waivers”; or

(i) as provided for in the Note Guarantees.

No release and discharge of a Note Guarantee pursuant to clauses (b) and (e) above shall be effective (i) if a Default or an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any Conditions of Issue as of the time of such proposed release and
discharge until such time as such Default or Event of Default is cured or waived and (ii) if so requested by the Security
Agent, until the Issuer shall have delivered to the Security Agent (x) an Officers’ Request Certificate and (y) Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent set forth in the relevant Conditions of Issue have been fulfilled and that
such release and discharge is authorized and permitted pursuant to such Conditions of Issue. The Security Agent shall be
entitled to accept such Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of
such conditions precedent, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Note Guarantee, as specified above, the Security Agent, subject to receipt
of certain documents from the Issuer or a Guarantor, will take all necessary action and execute any documents, including
the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
reasonably required in order to evidence such release, discharge and termination in respect of any Note Guarantee to be
released as described above. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect
any such release, discharge or termination.

**Restricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be “Restricted Subsidiaries”. However, under the
circumstances described below under “—Covenants—Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”, the Issuer will be
permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject
to any of the restrictive covenants in any of the relevant Conditions of Issue and will not guarantee the Notes.

**Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Holders’ Representative**

The Issuer will maintain for the Notes a Paying Agent (the “Paying Agent”), a Transfer Agent (the “Transfer Agent”)
and a Notification Agent (“Notification Agent”) for communication by the Holders’ Representative. The initial Paying
Agent, Transfer Agent and Notification Agent will be Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft.

The Issuer may appoint additional paying agents and transfer agents and revoke the appointment of any paying agent or
transfer agent; provided, however, that (i) for as long as the Notes are listed on a stock exchange, the Issuer shall at all
times ensure that a paying agent is appointed in the jurisdiction in which such stock exchange is located, if so required by
the rules of such stock exchange and (ii) in no event may the Issuer act as Paying Agent or appoint a Paying Agent in any
member state of the European Union where the Paying Agent would be obliged to withhold or deduct tax in connection
with any payment made by it in relation to the Notes unless the Paying Agent would be so obliged if it were located in all
other member states. Any such appointment or revocation shall be published without undue delay in accordance with the
provisions set forth under “—Notices”.


-----

The Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent reserve the right at any time to change their specified offices. Any such change
shall be published without undue delay in accordance with procedures set forth under “—Notices”.

The common representative (the “Holders’ Representative”) to exercise the Holders’ rights on behalf of the Holders of
the 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes, respectively, as provided for in the relevant Conditions of Issue will be TMF Trustee
Services GmbH, Wiesenhüttenstraße 11, 60329 Frankfurt am Main, Germany for both the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes,
respectively. The Holders’ Representative has the duties and powers provided for in the relevant Conditions of Issue, the
Intercreditor Agreement, by law or granted by resolution of the Holders. The Holders’ Representative shall comply with
the instructions of the Holders. To the extent that the Holders’ Representative has been authorized to assert certain rights
of the Holders, the Holders shall not be entitled to assert such rights themselves, unless explicitly provided for in the
relevant resolution or the relevant Conditions of Issue. The Holders’ Representative shall provide reports to the Holders on
its activities. The provisions of the German Act on Debt Securities of 2009 (Gesetz über Schuldverschreibungen aus
_Gesamtemissionen (Schuldverschreibungsgesetz- SchVG), “SchVG”) apply with regard to the removal of the Holders’_
Representative and its rights and obligations. Notwithstanding the next paragraph below, if the Holders of a series of Notes
choose to remove their Holders’ Representative or if the Holders’ Representative resigns and the Holders of such series
fail to appoint a successor Holders’ Representative, the exercise of certain rights under the relevant Conditions of Issue
may require a meeting of the Holders of such series and may be significantly more difficult to exercise.

The Holders’ Representative may be removed from office with respect to the 2029 Notes or the 2031 Notes at any time by
majority resolution of the Holders of the 2029 Notes or the 2031 Notes, as applicable, without specifying any reasons;
_provided that the Holders of each series of Notes shall only so remove the Holders’ Representative for their series of Notes_
if, at the same time, a successor Holders’ Representative for the relevant series of Notes is elected by such majority
resolution of the Holders of the relevant series of Notes. The Holders’ Representative may resign at any time by notifying
the Issuer (in which case the Issuer shall notify the Holders of the relevant series of Notes in accordance with the notice
provisions). If the Holders’ Representative resigns, it shall call a vote without undue delay to elect a successor Holders’
Representative. Any successor Holders’ Representative shall also succeed the retiring Holders’ Representative as a party
to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders’ Representative will be liable for the proper performance of its duties towards the Holders of each series of
Notes who will be joint and several creditors (Gesamtgläubiger); in the performance of its duties it shall act with the
diligence and care of a prudent business manager (ordentlicher und gewissenhafter Geschäftsleiter within the meaning of
Section 7(3) SchVG). The total liability of the Holders’ Representative to all Holders will be limited to €5,000,000 (or, if
higher, an amount equal to ten times the Holders’ Representative’s aggregate annual compensation for its services as
common representative of the Holders) in the aggregate, unless the Holders’ Representative’s liability has been caused by
its gross negligence (grobe Fahrlässigkeit) or wilful misconduct (Vorsatz) (in which case its liability shall be unlimited).
The responsibilities and liability of the Holders’ Representative is further limited as specified in the relevant Conditions of
Issue and may be further limited by a resolution passed by Holders.

The Holders’ Representative shall not under any circumstances be liable for any consequential loss. The Holders’
Representative shall be entitled to retain third party advisors if such appointment is, in its sole reasonable discretion,
required in, or for the performance of, its duties and the Issuer will bear such costs. The Holders’ Representative shall only
be responsible for the proper selection of such third-party advisor (Auswahlverschulden), but shall otherwise be entitled to
rely fully on the advice rendered by such third party advisor. In particular, the Holders’ Representative is not responsible
for the selection of the Security Agent and will have no responsibility towards the Holders or any other party for the
validity, perfection, sufficiency, adequacy, insuring of, priority or enforceability of any Note Guarantee, Collateral,
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, regardless of whether entered in before or after the Issue
Date.

The Holders’ Representative may demand from the Issuer to furnish all information required for the performance of the
duties entrusted to it.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer or, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Note Guarantee, any present or future
Guarantor or any successor of any of the foregoing (each a “Payor”) under or with respect to the Notes or any Note
Guarantee shall be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes, unless the
deduction or withholding of such Taxes is required by law. If any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed by or on behalf of or levied within (i) the Federal Republic of Germany, (ii) any jurisdiction from or through
which payment on the Notes or a Note Guarantee is made, (iii) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or
otherwise considered to be resident or conducts business for tax purposes or any (iv) province, municipality or other
political subdivision or taxing authority in or of any such jurisdiction under foregoing (i) through (iii) (any such jurisdiction
under foregoing (i) through (iv) a “Relevant Tax Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required to be made from any
payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee,


-----

the relevant Payor shall pay (together with such payment) such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the
net amounts received by the holders of the Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any deduction or
withholding from such additional amounts) shall equal the respective amounts of principal and interest that would have
been receivable in respect of the relevant Notes, in the absence of such deduction or withholding (the aggregate of such
additional amounts, “Additional Amounts”), except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the Holder or
beneficial owner of a Note (or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial
owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) having, or
having had, some personal or business connection with the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (other than the
mere acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of such Note, the enforcement of rights under such
Note or under a Note Guarantee, or the receipt of any payments in respect of such Note or Note
Guarantee) and not merely by reason of the fact that payments in respect of the Notes or any Note
Guarantee are, or for purposes of taxation are deemed to be, derived from sources in, or are secured in,
the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction;

(b) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with respect
to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(c) any German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) and church tax, if any, _plus solidarity surcharge_
(Solidaritätszuschlag) thereon, levied in Germany by a custodian bank or a disbursing agent acting on
behalf of the Holder;

(d) any Taxes imposed on a payment on a Note presented for payment (where presentation is required for
payment) by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the
relevant Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(e) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(f) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the failure of the
Holder, following the Issuer’s written request addressed to the Holder (and made at a time that would
enable the Holder acting reasonably to comply with that request, and in all events, at least 60 days before
any such withholding or deduction would be required), to comply with any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction
in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including,
without limitation, a certification that the Holder is not resident in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction), but in
each case, only to the extent the Holder is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(g) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed under section 1471 through 1474
of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as of the date of this offering
memorandum (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially
more onerous to comply with), including any current or future Treasury regulations or other official
interpretations thereunder or any law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental agreement
between a non-U.S. government and the United States with respect to the foregoing;

(h) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last of day of such 30 day period);

(i) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed on or with respect to any payments
under, or with respect to, the Notes or under or with respect to any Note Guarantee by reason of the
Holder being, or having been a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner
of any such payments to the extent that such Taxes would not have been imposed or required to be
withheld or deducted on such payments had such Holder been the sole beneficial owner of such Notes;

(j) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to the Defense against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur
_Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze) as_
amended; or

(k) any combination of items (a) through (j) above.


-----

In cases where the deduction or withholding of Taxes on or with respect to any payments under or with respect to the Notes
or with respect to any Note Guarantee is required by law to be made by a Payor, the Payor will (i) make any required
withholding or deduction and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in
accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain tax receipts evidencing the payment of
any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Tax Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will furnish to a Holder
upon written request within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made,
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing payment by the Payor, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s efforts to obtain receipts,
receipts are not obtained, other reasonably satisfactory evidence of payments by the Payor.

If the Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment, at least
30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee is due and
payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to such date, in which case it
must be delivered promptly thereafter), the Payor will deliver to the Paying Agent an Officers’ Request Certificate stating
the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable, the amounts estimated to be payable and such other information necessary
to enable the Paying Agent to inform the relevant Holders of the payment of such Additional Amounts in accordance with
the procedures set forth in “—Notices” on the payment date.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or property taxes, charges
or similar levies imposed by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including penalties, interest and other liabilities related thereto)
which arise from the execution, delivery, issuance or registration of the Notes or any Note Guarantee or any other document
or instrument referred to therein (other than a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt of any payments with respect to, or
enforcement of, the Notes or any Note Guarantee.

Whenever in the relevant Conditions of Issue or in this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment or non-payment of principal, premium or interest, if any, or any other amount payable under or with respect to
any Note or Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to
the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligations will survive any termination or defeasance of the relevant Conditions of Issue, any transfer by a
Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person
to the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized or otherwise considered to be resident or conducts business for tax purposes or
any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on the Notes or any Note Guarantee is made and any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any Guarantors under or in
connection with the Notes. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro (the “Required Currency”),
which is made to or for the account of any Holder in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the “Judgment Currency”),
whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall
constitute a discharge of the Issuer’s or the Guarantor’s obligation under the relevant Conditions of Issue and the Notes or
Note Guarantee, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency with such Holder, as the
case may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment Currency in
accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first Business Day following receipt
of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased is less than
the amount of the Required Currency originally due to such Holder, as the case may be, the Issuer shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Holder, as the case may be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency.
This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the relevant
Conditions of Issue and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any
indulgence granted by any Holder from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any
judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or order.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below and except pursuant to “—Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers” and “—
_Early Redemption for Taxation Reasons”, the relevant Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s option._

**_2029 Notes_**

At any time prior to March 31, 2026, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the
original principal amount of the 2029 Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional 2029 Notes) with
the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of         % of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date


-----

(subject to the rights of Holders of 2029 Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however,
that:

(i) at least 65% of the original principal amount of the 2029 Notes (including the original principal amount
of any Additional 2029 Notes) remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(ii) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice.

At any time prior to March 31, 2026, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the 2029
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the 2029 Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date (subject to the rights of Holders of 2029 Notes to receive interest
on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time on or after March 31, 2026, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
2029 Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of
principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the
applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on March 31 of the years indicated
below, subject to the rights of Holders of 2029 Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:

2026 ................................................................................................................................................................. %
2027 ................................................................................................................................................................. %
2028 and thereafter .......................................................................................................................................... 100.000%

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the 2029 Notes or portions
thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If the due date for any redemption payment in respect of
a 2029 Note is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest
shall accrue for the intervening period.

**_2031 Notes_**

At any time prior to March 31, 2027, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of the
original principal amount of the 2031 Notes (including the original principal amount of any Additional 2031 Notes) with
the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of         % of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date
(subject to the rights of Holders of 2031 Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however,
that:

(i) at least 65% of the original principal amount of the 2031 Notes (including the original principal amount
of any Additional 2031 Notes) remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(ii) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice.

At any time prior to March 31, 2027, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the 2031
Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the 2031 Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date (subject to the rights of Holders of 2031 Notes to receive interest
on the relevant interest payment date).

At any time on or after March 31, 2027, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
2031 Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of
principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the
applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on March 31 of the years indicated
below, subject to the rights of Holders of 2031 Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date:


-----

2027 ................................................................................................................................................................. %
2028 ................................................................................................................................................................. %
2029 and thereafter .......................................................................................................................................... 100.000%

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the 2031 Notes or portions
thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If the due date for any redemption payment in respect of
a 2031 Note is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest
shall accrue for the intervening period.

**Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers**

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Conditions of Issuer, in connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to
purchase or invitation to offer to purchase, the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset
Disposition Offer (as defined below) (each, a “Tender Offer”), if Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender (or offer to purchase) and do not validly withdraw (or revoke their
offer to purchase) such Notes in such Tender Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such Tender Offer in lieu of
the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered (or offered to purchase) and not validly withdrawn (or such offer to
purchase not having been validly revoked) by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, given not more than 30 days following the expiration date of the relevant Tender
Offer, to redeem all remaining Notes at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder (excluding any early tender
premium, incentive fee or similar payment) in such Tender Offer, plus, to the extent not included in the Tender Offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to but excluding the applicable redemption
date.

**Early Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

If (i) the Issuer becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts as set forth under “—Payment of Additional Amounts”
above, (ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the taking of reasonable measures available to the Issuer and (iii) the
requirement arises as a result of:

(a) any change in or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before, and which becomes effective on or after, the Issue Date or, if a
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction has changed since the Issue Date, the date on which such Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction became an applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction pursuant to the relevant Conditions of Issue
(the “Relevant Tax Jurisdiction Date”); or

(b) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official position
regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings
(including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
practice), which change, amendment, application or interpretation has not been publicly announced as
formally proposed before, and becomes effective on or after, the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction Date,

any relevant series of Notes may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the option of the Issuer, upon not less than
10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice of redemption at 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof together
with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) and
Additional Amounts, if any, then due and that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption
or otherwise (subject to the right of Holders to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional
Amounts, if any, in respect thereof).

Prior to giving any notice of redemption pursuant to this provision, the Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative
for delivery to the Holders in accordance with “—Notices” (i) an Officers’ Request Certificate stating that the Issuer is
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right
of the Issuer so to redeem have occurred and (ii) an Opinion of Counsel qualified under the laws of the Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction to the effect that there has been such change or amendment which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the
relevant series of Notes hereunder. The Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to accept such Opinion of Counsel as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of such conditions precedent, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on
the Holders.

No notice of redemption pursuant to this provision may be given (i) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which
the Issuer would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of the relevant series of Notes
then due, or (ii) if at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts does not remain in
effect.


-----

**Procedures of Redemption**

Any notice of redemption shall be given in accordance with the procedures set forth in “—Notices”. It shall be irrevocable,
must specify the amount of redemption, the terms and date fixed for redemption and must set forth a statement in summary
form of the facts constituting the basis for the right of the Issuer so to redeem the relevant series of Notes.

In the case of a partial redemption of a series of the Notes or the Notes, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in
accordance with the rules of the relevant clearing system. Such partial redemption shall be reflected in the records of
Clearstream Banking as either a pool factor or a reduction in aggregate principal amount.

The Issuer may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market purchase, negotiated
transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable laws, as long as such transaction does not otherwise violate the
relevant Conditions of Issue.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder shall have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part (equal to
€100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of
the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable
purchase date (the “Change of Control Purchase Price”), subject to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive interest on
the relevant interest payment date.

No later than 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer shall give notice in accordance with the procedures set
forth in “—Notices” below, with a copy to the Holders’ Representative, stating:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that each Holder has the right to require the
Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at the Change of Control Purchase Price (the “Change of Control
**Payment”);**

(b) the repurchase date (the repurchase date so stated the “Change of Control Payment Date”), which date
shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is given;

(c) the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the relevant Conditions of Issue, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased;

(d) that, if such notice is given prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Change of Control Offer
is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control;

(e) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

(f) that any Note accepted for Change of Control Payment will cease to accrue interest after the Change of
Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; and

(g) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest (the offer so being made the
“Change of Control Offer”).

The Issuer shall not be required to make the Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes
an offer in a manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the relevant Conditions
of Issue applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the relevant
Conditions of Issue as described above under “—Optional Redemption”, unless and until there is a default in payment of
the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer
may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made.

The Issuer shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer or any offer made in lieu thereof in accordance
with the procedures set forth in “—Notices” on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.


-----

Except as otherwise set forth under this heading “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control”, the
relevant Conditions of Issue do not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or
redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction that may adversely affect the Holders if
such transaction does not constitute a Change of Control. The Change of Control provisions described under this heading
“—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control” may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other
takeover attempts involving the Issuer by increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the
repurchase of Notes. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the
relevant Conditions of Issue, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the relevant Conditions of Issue by
virtue of the conflict.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance
or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken
as a whole. There is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable German law. Accordingly, the ability
of a Holder to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition
of less than all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may
be uncertain.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will have sufficient funds or other resources
to pay the Change of Control Payment for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders thereof seeking to accept the
Change of Control Offer, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—We may not be able to repay the Notes when due
_or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to do so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or_
_otherwise, and the change of control provision contained in the Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you_
_protection in the event of certain important corporate events”._

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness_
(including Acquired Indebtedness) if (i) on the date thereof and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma
application of the proceeds thereof) (x) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, and (y) to the extent such Indebtedness is purported to be secured by a Lien, the
Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be no greater than 4.0 to 1.0, and

(including under ancillary facilities made available under such Credit Facility) in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed (A) €250 million, _plus (B) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness_
permitted under this clause (i) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting

or a Guarantor (except in case of intercompany liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of
business in connection with cash pooling or cash management or tax positions of the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries), such Indebtedness must be unsecured and to the extent legally
permitted (the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures required
in the reasonable judgment of directors of the obligee or obligor to protect such Persons from
any penalty or civil or criminal liability in connection with the subordination of such
Indebtedness) expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations then
due with respect to the Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the relevant Note Guarantee, in the
case of a Guarantor; and


-----

(B) (x) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock that results in any such Indebtedness
being held by a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and (y) any sale or other
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is neither the Issuer nor a Restricted
Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this
clause (ii);

(iii) any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (iv), (v), or (x) or this clause (iii);

than any Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility permitted under
clause (i) above or any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (ii), (vi) or (vii));

(v) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer and the Guarantors represented by the Notes to be issued on the Issue

Restricted Subsidiary to the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be Incurred by
another provision of this covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; _provided, however, that if the_
Indebtedness being guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then
the Guarantee must be subordinated or pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness
guaranteed;

(viii) Indebtedness Incurred after the Issue Date in respect of workers’ compensation claims, early retirement
obligations, or social security or wage taxes in the ordinary course of business;

(ix) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations,
Purchase Money Obligations or other Indebtedness Incurred or assumed in connection with the

part of the purchase price, lease expense, rental payments (other than lease payments or rental expenses
under a capitalized lease for reporting purposes under GAAP) or cost of design, installation, construction
or improvement of property used in the business of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in an
aggregate principal amount pursuant to this clause (ix), including any Refinancing Indebtedness that

utilized to consummate any of the aforementioned transactions or series of related transactions or
(b) otherwise in connection with, or in contemplation of, such transaction or series of related
transactions); _provided, however, that at the time such Restricted Subsidiary is acquired (or other_
transaction is made) by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary, (A) the Issuer would have been able
to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (i)(x) of the first paragraph of this covenant
“—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer would not be less
than it was immediately prior to such acquisition or other transaction, in each case after giving pro forma
effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (x);

Liabilities) entered into in the ordinary course of business (as determined in good faith by the Issuer’s
Board of Directors); provided, however, that, in relation to the foregoing sub-clauses (a) through (d),
upon the drawing (Inanspruchnahme) of such letters of credit or other instrument, such obligations are
reimbursed within 30 days following such drawing (Inanspruchnahme);

(xii) Indebtedness Incurred in any Qualified Securitization Financing;

(xiii) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with a Credit Facility
for purposes of financing any expansion projects in an aggregate amount not exceeding €75 million
outstanding at any one time plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this
clause (xiii) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and
other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing; or

(xiv) in addition to the items referred to in clauses (i) through (xiii) above, Indebtedness of the Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate amount not exceeding €20 million outstanding at any one time;
_provided that the aggregate amount of such Indebtedness that may be Incurred pursuant to this_
clause (xiv) by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall not exceed €10 million outstanding
at any one time.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant:

(i) in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the foregoing first paragraph of this covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and clauses (i)
through (xiv) of the second paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted
to classify and may from time to time reclassify such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies
with this covenant and include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one or more of the foregoing
clauses (i) through (xiv) of the second paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant; provided that all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Secured
Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed Incurred under clause (i) of the second paragraph of this
covenant and not under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (iv) of the second paragraph of this
covenant and may not later be reclassified;

(ii) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness Incurred in reliance on a clause of this
covenant “—Limitation on Indebtedness” measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the relevant percentage restriction to
be exceeded if calculated based on the relevant percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such
refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA shall be deemed not to be exceeded, as long as
the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs, fees and
other expenses in connection with such refinancing;

(iii) for the purposes of determining Consolidated EBITDA under this covenant “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured at the option of the Issuer on the most recent_
date on which new commitments are obtained or on the date on which new Indebtedness is Incurred;

(iv) in the event Indebtedness relates to Guarantees of Indebtedness permitted by this covenant, such
Guarantees shall not be treated as an additional Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(v) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred
pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (i), (ix), (x), (xiii) or
(xiv) of the second paragraph of this covenant or under the first paragraph of this covenant and the letters
of credit, bankers’ acceptance or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(vi) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Guarantor, or preferred stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or
the liquidation preference thereof;

(vii) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:


-----

(A) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount;

(B) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(C) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(x) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(y) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person;

(viii) with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid
pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility
that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of
this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date
of any subsequent reborrowing thereof;

(ix) for purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving Credit Facility; provided that:

(A) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue
Date will be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date;
and

(B) if for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject to an agreement intended to protect against
fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness
is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, if denominated in euro will be the amount of the principal payment required to
be made under such currency agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount
_plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not_
covered by such currency agreement; and

(x) the principal amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness
being refinanced will be the Euro Equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined as of the date
such Indebtedness was originally Incurred, except that to the extent that:

(A) such Euro Equivalent was determined based on an agreement intended to protect against
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be
determined in accordance with sub-clause (B) of clause (vii) above; and

(B) the principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Euro Equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such Refinancing Indebtedness is being Incurred.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

such Restricted Payment:

(i) a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result from such Restricted

(iii) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments (other than pursuant
to (ii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x) and (xiv) and other than pursuant to (xiii) in relation to a
Restricted Payment pursuant to (xiv) and _provided further that any Restricted Payment pursuant to_


-----

(xii) shall only be included to the extent the Build-up Amount (as defined below) not falling below zero
as a result of such Restricted Payment, or if already being negative at the time of such Restricted Payment,
further decreasing such negative Build-up Amount) described under the second paragraph of this “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant made subsequent to the Issue Date, would exceed the sum_
of (such sum, the “Build-up Amount”):

Subsidiaries as of the date such entity becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, or (c) in the case of a
Guarantee made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, that is fully and unconditionally
released, an amount equal to the amount of such Guarantee to the extent such Guarantee reduced
the capacity to make Restricted Payment pursuant to this clause (iii); plus

Date is re-designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged or consolidated into the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary, or all of the assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary are transferred to the

case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens and (ii) Liens that are not Permitted
Liens if, contemporaneously with the Incurrence of such Initial Lien, the Notes and the obligations under the relevant
Conditions of Issue (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with,

Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured and (b) in the case of any property or asset constituting Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate the transaction
or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer or was acquired by the Issuer or in contemplation of the transaction) and
outstanding on such date;

Disqualified Stock Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise extends, renews, refunds, refinances or
replaces, an agreement or instrument or obligation in effect or entered into on the Issue Date (an “Initial
**Agreement”) or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an Initial Agreement**
(an “Amendment”); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
Refinancing Agreement or Amendment are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes taken
as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial
Agreements to which such Refinancing Agreement or Amendment relates (as determined in good faith
by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) and either (x) the Issuer determines that such
encumbrances and restrictions will not adversely affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal and interest
payments on the Notes as and when they come due or (y) such encumbrances and restrictions apply only
during the continuance of a default in respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to
such Indebtedness;

(iv) any restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for

license or other contract entered into in the ordinary course of business;

with the relevant Conditions of Issue to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the

(C) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth in
any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(vi) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law (including, but not limited
to, any capital maintenance or similar corporate law restrictions applicable to such Restricted Subsidiary
the breach of which would, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or relevant
Restricted Subsidiary, result in any civil or criminal liability of any directors or officers of the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary) or any applicable rule, regulation or order or governmental license, permit or
concession;

(vii) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or suppliers or required by
insurance, surety or bonding companies, in each case, under contracts (not evidencing or relating to
Indebtedness) entered into in the ordinary course of business;

-----

favorable to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary than to any other joint venturer and (iii) will not
materially affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes, as determined

agreements (and at the time of any modification of the terms of any such encumbrance or restriction);
and

(xiii) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be Incurred subsequent to

restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the Holders of the Notes than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the the
Senior Secured Facilities, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, in each case, as in
effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors of the Issuer) and where, in the case of this clause (ii), either (x) the Issuer
determines when such Indebtedness is Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely
affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes as
and when they come due or (y) the Issuer determines that such encumbrances and restrictions apply only
during the continuance of a default in respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to
such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(i) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at least equal to the Fair Market Value
(such Fair Market Value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset
Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer (including as to the
value of all non-cash consideration), of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition;

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, at least 75% of the consideration is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of this “—Limitation on Sales of Assets” covenant, each of the following shall
be deemed cash:

(A) any liabilities, as shown on the Issuer’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities, Disqualified Stock and liabilities
that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by
the transferee of any such assets pursuant to any agreement that releases the Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary from or indemnifies against further liability;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary from
such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary into cash
or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Disposition, to the extent
of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(C) any Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted
Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(D) consideration consisting of Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(E) any Designated Non Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non Cash
Consideration received and designated pursuant to this clause (E) that is at any one time
outstanding, not to exceed €15 million (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the Issuer
or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:


-----

(A) to the extent the Issuer elects, to prepay, repay or purchase (x) Indebtedness that is secured by
a Permitted Collateral Lien that ranks equal to or in priority to any Lien on such assets securing
the Notes or the Note Guarantees and is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes or the
Note Guarantees (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under the Senior Secured Facilities and
any purchase or redemption of any Notes (provided that any such purchase or redemption is at
or above 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, _plus accrued and unpaid interest and_
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of such purchase or redemption)), (y) Indebtedness
which is secured by a Lien (other than a Permitted Collateral Lien) on the asset which is the
subject of the Asset Sale or (z) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor
(other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer), in each case, within
395 days from the date of the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that in
connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this
sub-clause (A), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will cause the related commitment (if
any) to be permanently reduced in an equal amount to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid
or purchased;

(B) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with the
foregoing sub-clause (A), to the extent the Issuer elects, to invest in Additional Assets within
395 days from the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash or pursuant to binding
arrangements in place within such 395 day period; provided that such binding arrangement is
completed within 180 days of such 395 day period;

(C) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with the
foregoing sub-clauses (A) and (B), to the extent the Issuer elects, to make a capital expenditure
within 395 days from the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash or pursuant to binding
arrangements in place within such 395 day period; provided that such binding arrangement is
completed within 180 days of such 395 day period; or

(D) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with the
foregoing sub-clauses (A) to (C) (the "Excess Proceeds"), to make an offer to the Holders and
any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (to the extent the terms of such Pari Passu Indebtedness so
require) on a _pro rata basis to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the_
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date
of purchase and such Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to and subject to the relevant Conditions
of Issue (an “Asset Disposition Offer”); _provided, however, that in connection with any_
prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to the foregoing sub-clause (A),
the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall retire such Indebtedness and shall cause
the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchase.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this “—Limitation on Sales of Assets” covenant, the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be required to apply any Excess Proceeds in accordance with sub-clause (D) above unless
the aggregate Excess Proceeds from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied in accordance with the foregoing subclauses (A) to (C) exceeds €15 million. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the
relevant Conditions of Issue. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof and other Pari
Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer shall
accept the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of the Asset Disposition Offer. Upon completion
of such Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Asset Disposition Offer will
remain open for a period of 20 Business Days following its commencement, except to the extent that a longer period is
required by applicable law (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five Business Days after the termination
of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal
amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition
**Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu**
Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase
Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a _pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset_
Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn, in each case with a principal amount of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Issuer will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset


-----

Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes or holder or lender of Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as the case may be, an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn by such holder or lender, as the case may be, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase. In addition,
the Issuer will take any and all other actions required by the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer
will publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer on the Asset Disposition Purchase Date.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the rendering of services) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such
transaction or series of related transactions, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate consideration in excess of
€5 million unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction with a Person who is
not an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of €10 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the Board
of Directors of the Issuer (and such majority determines that such Affiliate Transaction satisfies the
criteria in clause (i)).

The provisions of the foregoing paragraph shall not apply to:

(i) transactions pursuant to any employee or director compensation arrangements or benefit plans entered
into by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing;

(iii) any Affiliate Transaction between the Issuer and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(iv) any Restricted Payment (other than a Restricted Investment) permitted to be made pursuant to the
provisions set forth under “—Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” above;

(v) the payment of reasonable and customary fees paid to, and indemnity provided on behalf of, officers,
directors or employees of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(vi) the Incurrence of Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(vii) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated, by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and transactions
pursuant to any amendment (including to change any party to the agreement), modification or extension
to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or extension, taken as a whole, is not more
disadvantageous to the Holders than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;

(viii) any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to Affiliates of the Issuer;

(ix) transactions (x) with the Issuer and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, consistent with
past practice and as otherwise permitted hereunder or (y) for which the Issuer shall have received a
written opinion from an independent investment bank or an accounting or appraisal firm of
internationally recognized standing or other recognized independent expert of international standing with
experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of related transactions
for which an opinion is required, stating that such Affiliate Transaction is (a) fair to the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (b) not materially less favorable than those that
might reasonably have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis
from a Person that is not an Affiliate;

(x) (x) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or
providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of trading, or (y) any
transaction in the ordinary course of business between the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and
any Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because a director of such Person is also a director of
the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, in each case, provided (a) such transaction is


-----

otherwise in compliance with the terms of the relevant Conditions of Issue and (b) is on terms at least as
favorable as could have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated Person, in the reasonable
determination of the members of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer provided such Officer
has been delegated such power by the Board of Directors in the prior twelve months (provided no member
of the Board of Directors or Officer of the Issuer with an interest in such transaction may participate in
such determination); and

(xi) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between or among the Issuer and
any Restricted Subsidiary and any other Person with which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
files a consolidated tax return or with which the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is part of a
group for tax purposes or any tax advantageous group contribution made pursuant to applicable
legislation; provided, however, that such payments or transactions will not exceed the lesser of (i) the
amount of tax that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would owe on a stand-alone basis if the Issuer
were filing a separate tax return (or a separate consolidated or combined tax return with its Restricted
Subsidiaries that are part of that consolidated or combined group) and (ii) the related tax liabilities of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries that are relieved thereby.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish in English to the Holders (each with a copy to the Holders’
Representative) in accordance with clause (ii) of “—Notices”:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer (beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2024), annual reports containing the following information: (a) audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and audited consolidated
income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two most recent fiscal years, including
complete footnotes to such financial statements and the report of the independent auditors on the financial
statements; (b) pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates
(unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3)
below (provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available
without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials to the extent available without unreasonable expense)); (c) an operating and
financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations
(including a discussion by business segment to the extent segment reporting is required under GAAP),
financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of the business, management and
shareholders of the Issuer, material affiliate transactions and material debt instruments (unless such
contractual arrangements were described in a previous annual or quarterly report, in which case the Issuer
need describe only any material changes); and (e) material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer
(beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024), quarterly reports containing the following
information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such quarter and
unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the quarterly and year to date periods ending
on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and, the comparable prior year periods for the Issuer,
together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) pro forma income statement and balance sheet
information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions
or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter
as to which such quarterly report relates (provided that such _pro forma financial information will be_
provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer will
provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials (to the extent available without
unreasonable expense)); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements
(including a discussion by business segment to the extent segment reporting is required under GAAP),
including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and
any material change between the current quarterly period and the corresponding period of the prior year;
and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the Issuer and
the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any changes of the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer or managing director of the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer or any other material event
that the Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a description of such event;


-----

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to (i) contain any_
reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or IFRS or (ii) include separate financial statements for any
Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In addition, if the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Subsidiary or
group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary, then the
quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results
of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of
the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as provided for above, no report needs to
include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results
of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this offering memorandum.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the Holders and to
securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to
Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, the Issuer will also
(a) post such report on the Issuer’s website and (b) make available copies of such reports to the Listing Agent, for the
purpose of sending to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (to the extent required by the rules of The
International Stock Exchange Authority Limited). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have
provided such information to the Holders’ Representative, the Holders, prospective purchasers and beneficial owners of
the Notes if such information referenced above in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above has been posted on the Issuer’s website.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer shall not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into another Person, or convey, transfer or
lease all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one
or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organized and
existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union as of December 31, 2003,
Switzerland, the United States of America or the District of Columbia, and the Successor Company (if
not the Issuer) will expressly assume in appropriate documentation delivered to the Holders’
Representative all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the relevant Agency Agreements and the relevant Conditions of Issue;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and any related financings the Successor Company
would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (i)(x) of the first
paragraph of the “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant above;

(iv) each Guarantor shall have delivered to the Holders’ Representative a confirmation that its Note
Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations in respect of the Notes and the relevant Agency
Agreements;

(v) if any such transaction results in the Issuer or Successor Company being incorporated in a jurisdiction
other than Germany, the Board of Directors of the Issuer and the Successor Company will have adopted
a resolution stating that the transaction effecting such a change in jurisdiction was not being entered into
for a purpose which included subjecting the Issuer or the Successor Company, as the case may be, to
more favorable bankruptcy, insolvency, laws relating to creditors rights or similar laws; and

(vi) the Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative an Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of
Counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and such
assumption by the Successor Company comply with this covenant and the Opinion of Counsel shall state


-----

in addition that each of the Note Guarantees shall apply to such Person’s obligations in respect of the
Notes and the relevant Agency Agreements to the same or greater extent than they applied to the Notes
and the relevant Agency Agreements immediately prior to such transaction. The Holders’ Representative
shall be entitled to accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of compliance with this
paragraph and shall not be obligated to independently investigate whether the requirements of this
paragraph are otherwise met.

_Guarantors_

In addition, the Issuer shall not permit any Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to consolidate with or merge with or into
another Person, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all the properties and assets of such Guarantor and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(i) either:

(A) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person will be a Person organized and existing under the
laws of any member state of the European Union on 31 December 2003, Switzerland, the United
States of America, the District of Columbia or the jurisdiction in which it was originally
organized, and such Person (if not a Guarantor) will expressly assume in an appropriate
documentation and delivered to the Holders’ Representative, all the obligations of such
Guarantor under its Note Guarantee; or

(B) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the
properties and assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the relevant Conditions of Issue;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to, and as a result of, such transaction no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing;

(iii) in the case of clause (i)(A) above, if any such transaction results in the Guarantor or Successor Company
being incorporated in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which it was organized as of the Issue
Date, the Board of Directors of the Guarantor and the Successor Company will have adopted a resolution
stating that the transaction effecting such a change in jurisdiction was not being entered into for a purpose
which included subjecting the Guarantor or the Successor Company, as the case may be, to more
favorable bankruptcy, insolvency, laws relating to creditors rights or similar laws; and

(iv) the Issuer and such Guarantor shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative in accordance with “Notices”
an Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation,
merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, in the case of clause (i)(A) only, such assumption by the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person comply with this covenant and the Opinion of Counsel shall
state in addition that the Note Guarantee by the resulting, surviving or transferee Person shall apply to
such Person’s obligations in respect of the Notes and the relevant Agency Agreements to the same or
greater extent than they applied to the Notes and such Agency Agreement immediately prior to such
transaction. The Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient
evidence of compliance with this paragraph and shall not be obligated to independently investigate
whether the requirements of this paragraph are otherwise met.

The successor to any Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the applicable Note Guarantee.

This “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation, merger or transfer of assets of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor into the Issuer or a Guarantor, (b) any consolidation, merger or transfer of
assets among Guarantors, or (c) any consolidation, merger or transfer of assets among the Issuer and any Guarantor;
_provided that, clauses (i) and (vi) of the first paragraph of this covenant will be complied with. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the_
first paragraph and clause (ii) of the second paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any merger or consolidation of the
Issuer or any Guarantors with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or such Guarantor in
another jurisdiction.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable German law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or
substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or a Guarantor and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as applicable.


-----

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and the rules of the
International Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of the occurrence of any of the events described in
this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant in accordance with the prevailing rules of The International Stock Exchange
Authority Limited.

**_Future Guarantors_**

The Issuer shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and that, (a) after the Issue Date, Guarantees any
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor or (b) is a Significant Subsidiary, to execute and deliver concurrently to the
Holders’ Representative a Note Guarantee pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the
Notes, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness, provided that (i) any accession of any Significant Subsidiary otherwise required pursuant to clause (b) of this
sentence shall be subject to the Agreed Security Principles, and (ii) solely for purposes of clause (b) of this sentence, any
Restricted Subsidiary incorporated or established in France or Italy shall only be deemed to be a “Significant Subsidiary”
if it has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA)
representing 10% or more of Consolidated EBITDA.

Any such Restricted Subsidiary will, simultaneously with the execution of such Note Guarantee, pledge its existing and
future assets to the extent such assets secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities (in particular, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles as set forth therein) to secure the Notes and its Note Guarantee, and, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the Issuer will cause all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary owned by the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries to be pledged to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees.

Each Additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference,
financial assistance or thin-capitalisation rules or other similar laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any
applicable jurisdiction). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject
_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit_
_its validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests”._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to Guarantee the Notes
to the extent that such Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would reasonably be expected to give rise to or result
in a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably
available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary (including “whitewash” or similar procedures) or any liability for the
officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on Lines of Business_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a Related Business,
except as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on the International
Stock Exchange for so long as any Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to such
listing or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of the Notes on another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which
may be another stock exchange that is not regulated by the European Union).

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be
paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any consent or vote with respect to
any waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the relevant Conditions of Issue, the Notes, the relevant
Agency Agreements, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Note Guarantee unless (and to the extent
such offer or payment is not prohibited by applicable law) such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders
that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent,
waiver or amendment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or payment of
consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the
relevant Conditions of Issue, to exclude the Holders in any jurisdiction where (A)(i) the solicitation of such consent, waiver


-----

or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor
would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document
under any applicable securities laws (including, but not limited to, the U.S. federal securities laws and the laws of the
European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be
materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent document(s)
used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial
services authorities in such jurisdiction) or (B) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in
such jurisdiction.

**_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

As of the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries shall be Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the Issuer (including any newly acquired or newly
formed Subsidiary or a Person becoming a Subsidiary through merger, consolidation or other business combination
transaction, or Investment therein) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary only if:

(i) such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of or have any
Investment in, or own or hold any Lien on any property of, any other Subsidiary of the Issuer which is
not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated or otherwise an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(ii) no Indebtedness of such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at the date of designation, or at any
time thereafter, constitute Indebtedness pursuant to which the lender has recourse to any of the assets of
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(iii) such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary has
any direct or indirect obligation to:

(A) subscribe for additional Capital Stock of such Person; or

(B) maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or cause such person to achieve any
specified levels of operating results;

(iv) all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in
the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount which shall be the
Restricted Payment’s Fair Market Value at the time of such transfer and a Restricted Payment in such
amount would be permitted at such time under the covenant set forth under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” or the definition of “Permitted Investments” and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the_
definition of an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”; and

(v) after giving effect to, and as a result of, such designation there will be no Default or Event of Default.

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
however, that such designation shall be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any
outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such designation shall be permitted only if (i) immediately
after giving effect to such designation, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the
Issuer could Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness as described in clause (i)(x) of the first paragraph under “—
_Limitation on Indebtedness”, on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation as if it had occurred at the beginning_
of the applicable reference period.

Any such designation by the Board of Directors of the Issuer shall be evidenced to the Holders’ Representative by filing
with the Holders’ Representative a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer giving effect to such designation and
an Officers’ Request Certificate certifying that such designation complies with the foregoing conditions. The Holders’
Representative shall forward such resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer and the Officers’ Request Certificate
to the Holders in accordance with the procedures set forth in “—Notices”.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or negligently omit
to take, any action which action or omission might or would have the result of materially impairing the security interest
with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition
of “Permitted Collateral Liens” shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with
respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Holders’ Representative and the Holders, and the Issuer will not, and will


-----

not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit
of the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement, any interest
whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that

(i) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance with the
relevant Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Documents; and

(ii) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and provided further,
however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension,
replacement, restatement, supplement, modification or renewal, the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent
either:

(A) a solvency opinion from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
standing confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving
effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement;

(B) a certificate from the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of
the relevant Person, which confirms the solvency of the person granting Security Interest after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement; or

(C) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes
created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
modified or replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph which shall not apply to the actions described in this paragraph, at the direction
of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders of any series of Notes or the Holders’ Representative, the Security
Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to: (i) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens to the extent permitted by the relevant
Conditions of Issue; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; (v) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer and the assumption by such successor
of the obligations under the relevant Conditions of Issue, the Notes and the Security Documents, in each case, in accordance
with “—Merger and Consolidation”; (vi) provide for the release of property and assets constituting Collateral from the
Lien of the Security Documents or the release of a Note Guarantee granted by a Guarantor, in each case, in accordance
with (and if permitted by) the terms of the relevant Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor Agreement; (vii) conform the
Security Documents to this “Description of the Notes”; (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the appointment
of a successor Holders’ Representative or Security Agent; or (ix) make any other change thereto that does not adversely
affect the rights of the Holders in any material respect.

In the event that the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary complies with this covenant, the Holders’ Representative
and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement with no need for instructions from Holders.

**_Security_**

The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each Guarantor shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such acts and things
and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require

(i) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting the
security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents; and

(ii) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of
the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of all powers,
authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any part of those
assets. The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each Guarantor shall, execute all transfers, conveyances,


-----

assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent or to its nominees and give all
notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may reasonably request.

**_Amendment and Restatement of Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

Following the completion of the Refinancing, we intend to enter into an amendment and restatement agreement relating to
the Intercreditor Agreement as described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement”. At the direction of the Issuer and without further consent of the Holders’ Representative, the Security Agent_
or any Holder, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Holders’ Representative, the Security Agent and the Senior Secured
Facility Lenders and/or their respective agents shall enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement to
(i) insert a formal mechanism for the resignation of Secured Creditors (as defined under the Intercreditor Agreement) as
parties to the Intercreditor Agreement following the termination and discharge in full of the Primary Finance Documents
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) pursuant to which they originally became Secured Creditors, (ii) delete
references to the old super senior revolving credit facility of the Group that was terminated in 2023, (iii) amend the
definition of “Credit Facility” in the intercreditor agreement to “Super Senior Credit Facility” in order to reflect the
deviating usage of such term in the Conditions of Issue that will govern the Notes and the covenant schedules of the Senior
Secured Facilities Agreements, (iv) provide for a mechanism that permits the granting of Security in favor of Pari Passu
Debt Creditors (or their affiliates) which make available ancillary facilities pursuant to the terms of a Pari Passu Debt
Document (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and (v) to implement various technical amendments that will not
adversely affect the Holders in any material respect (the “ICA Amendment Agreement”).

Furthermore, at the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the Incurrence of any Indebtedness that is permitted to
share the Collateral, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Holders’ Representative, the Security Agent and the Senior
Secured Facility Lenders and/or their respective agents shall enter into an additional intercreditor agreement (each an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement (or not materially
less favorable to the Holders) or an amendment to, or an amendment and restatement of, the Intercreditor Agreement (which
amendment is not materially less favorable to the Holders); _provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement or_
amendment to, or amendment and restatement of, the Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on
the Holders’ Representative or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Holders’ Representative under the relevant Conditions of Issue or the Intercreditor Agreement; provided further that it is
understood and agreed that an increase in the amount of Indebtedness being subjected to the terms of any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or amendment to, or amendment and restatement of, the Intercreditor Agreement will be deemed
to be on substantially similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and will be deemed not to adversely affect the rights of
the Holders and will be permitted by this covenant if, in each case, the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (and any Lien in
its favor), would not be otherwise prohibited by the relevant Conditions of Issue.

The relevant Conditions of Issue will also provide that, at the request and subject to the following paragraph, the Holders’
Representative and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the further consent of the Holders to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement; (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject
to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes); (3) add Restricted
Subsidiaries or Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (4) further secure the
Notes (including any additional Notes); (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
additional Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (including additional Notes); (6) implement any Permitted Liens and Permitted
Collateral Liens; (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof; (8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to (i) remove any
references to any instruments governing any existing Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
following the full redemption or repayment of such Pari Passu Debt Liabilities and the cancellation or termination of the
relevant instruments, as applicable and/or (ii) replace any such references with references to any new instruments governing
any new Pari Passu Debt Liabilities that replaces and/or refinances any existing Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, in each case in
accordance with the relevant Conditions of Issue; or (9) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders in any material respect.

The relevant Conditions of Issue will also provide that the Holders’ Representative shall be authorized to enter into a
creditor/creditor representative accession agreement as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the ICA Amendment Agreementand any amendment referred to in the preceding paragraphs and
that neither the Holders’ Representative nor the Security Agent shall not be required to seek the consent of any Holders to
perform their obligations under and in accordance with this covenant, provided that the Holders’ Representative shall —
in case of any amendment referred to in the preceding paragraphs — not waive any rights of the Holders without their prior
consent to be given by majority resolution passed pursuant to this covenant. Before entering into an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or effecting any amendment to, or amendment and restatement of, the Intercreditor Agreement (other than


-----

pursuant to the ICA Amendment Agreement) pursuant to this covenant, the Holders’ Representative or the Security Agent
may elect to base its decision on an Officers’ Request Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Holders’ Representative or the Security Agent, as applicable. Neither the Holders’ Representative nor
the Security Agent shall be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers’ Request
Certificate or Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall notify the Holders of the entry of an Additional Intercreditor Agreement
or any amendment to, or amendment and restatement of, the Intercreditor Agreement (other than pursuant to the ICA
Amendment Agreement) effected pursuant to this covenant without undue delay in accordance with procedures set forth
in the Conditions of Issue.

**_Suspension of Covenants_**

If on any date following the date of the relevant Conditions of Issue:

(i) the Notes are rated with an Investment Grade Rating by both Rating Agencies; and

(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the relevant Conditions of Issue (the foregoing
conditions being referred to collectively as the “Suspension Condition”);

then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants specifically listed under
the following captions in this “Description of the Notes” (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”) of the relevant
Conditions of Issue will be suspended as to the Notes:

      - “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

      - “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

      - “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

      - “—Limitation on Sales of Assets”;

      - “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

      - “—Limitation on Lines of Business”;

      - “—Future Guarantors”; and

      - clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph and (ii) of the second paragraph, respectively, of “—Merger and
_Consolidation”._

During any period that the foregoing sections have been suspended, the Issuer’s Board of Directors may not designate any
of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to “—Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” unless the
designation would have complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants
with respect to a series of the Notes for any period of time as a result of the Suspension Condition having been met and,
subsequently, one or both Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment Grade Rating or downgrade the Investment Grade
Rating assigned to that series of Notes such that the relevant series of Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating
by both Rating Agencies, then the Issuer and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the
Suspended Covenants. (a) Compliance with the Suspended Covenants with respect to Restricted Payments made after the
time of such withdrawal or downgrade (i) will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the reinstated “—Limitation
_on Restricted Payments” covenant as if the provisions had been in effect since the Issue Date (accordingly, Restricted_
Payments made during such period when the Suspended Covenants are suspended will reduce the amount available to be
made as Restricted Payments described under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”) and (ii) will
be calculated in accordance with the terms of the reinstated “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant as if any Indebtedness
Incurred on or after the occurrence of the Suspension Condition will be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; and (b) the Issuer will, and will cause each Restricted
Subsidiary that would have been required to Guarantee the Notes pursuant to “—Future Guarantors” during such period
when the Suspended Covenants are suspended to take all actions it would have been required to take to comply with “—
_Future Guarantors” if it had not been suspended including executing a Note Guarantee and pledging the Restricted_
Subsidiary’s existing and future assets and pledging all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted Subsidiary to secure the
Notes and the Note Guarantee; provided, further, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind will be deemed
to exist under the relevant Conditions of Issue with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer
or any of its Subsidiaries will bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring after such series of Notes attains


-----

the required ratings and before any reinstatement of the Suspended Covenants as provided above, or any actions, taken at
any time pursuant to any contractual obligations arising prior to the reinstatement of the Suspended Covenants, regardless
of whether those actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable sections had remained in effect during such
period.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the relevant Conditions of Issue in connection with any
paper machine project (including with regard to the Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or the making of any related
Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments, as the case may be), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and
of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the Commitment Date (as defined below) with regard
to any such paper machine project for purposes of determining the ability to Incur any related Indebtedness or make any
related Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments (in each case, as set forth in the then-current budget for such
paper machine project prepared in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer and approved by the Board of Directors of the
Issuer) after the Commitment Date (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the
avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio or
any component thereof (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA) subsequent to such date of determination
and at or prior to the Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or the making of any related Restricted Payments and/or
Permitted Investments, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations
solely for purposes of determining whether the Incurrence of any such related Indebtedness or the making of any such
Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at
the time any such related Indebtedness is actually Incurred or any such Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments are
actually made; provided further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the Commitment Date, the
Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or the making of any related Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments
shall be deemed to have occurred on the Commitment Date and any such Indebtedness shall be deemed to be outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the relevant Conditions of Issue after the Commitment
Date and before the earlier of (i) the actual Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or the actual making of any related
Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments, as applicable and (ii) the date on which the Issuer determines that the
relevant paper machine project has been completed or abandoned (as set forth in an Officers’ Request Certificate).
“Commitment Date” with regard to any paper machine project for the purpose of this covenant shall mean the date
specified as such in a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer; provided that the Issuer and/or one or more of its
Subsidiaries, on the date of such resolutions, reasonably expects to enter, within three months of the date of such resolution,
into one or more definitive agreements with one or more third parties with regard to the realization of the relevant paper
machine project with an aggregate value of no less than €50 million.

**Events of Default, Enforcement**

Each of the following constitutes an “Event of Default” under the relevant Conditions of Issue:

(a) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(b) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due and payable at its Stated
Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon acceleration or otherwise;

(c) failure by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to comply with any obligation under the covenant set forth
under “—Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”, “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a
_Change of Control”, or “—Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets”, continued for 30 days, other than_
a failure to purchase Notes which shall constitute an Event of Default under the foregoing clause (b);

(d) failure by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to comply for 60 days after notice from the Holders’
Representative (upon instruction by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding) with its other obligations contained in the relevant Conditions of Issue;

(e) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there
may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for borrowed money by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries),
other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or
guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the relevant Conditions of Issue, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay when due principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such
Indebtedness prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period provided for under the terms
of such Indebtedness (“payment default”); or


-----

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of
any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which has
been so accelerated aggregates €40 million or more;

(f) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization under bankruptcy laws of (i) the Issuer, (ii) a
Guarantor or (iii) a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary;

(g) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
€10 million (net of any amounts that are covered by insurance policies issued by reputable and
creditworthy insurance companies), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of
60 days after the judgment exceeding such threshold becomes final;

(h) any Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force
and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of such Note Guarantee or the relevant Conditions of
Issue or as provided under applicable law) or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding or the
Issuer or any such Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing or in any pleading in any court its obligations
under the relevant Conditions of Issue or its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for ten days;
or

(i) with respect to any Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of €20 million, individually or in the
aggregate, (i) (a) the security interest under the relevant Conditions of Issue or the Security Documents,
at any time, ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason other than in accordance with the terms
of the Security Documents and other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Notes or
(b) any security interest created thereunder or under the Security Documents is declared invalid or
unenforceable and such Default continues for 15 days after the Issuer becomes aware of the Default or
(ii) the Issuer or any Guarantor asserts that any such security interest or Security Document is invalid or
unenforceable prior to the time that the Collateral is to be released to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default pursuant to the foregoing clause (f)) occurs and is continuing, the
Holders’ Representative (i) upon instruction of Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of all outstanding 2029 Notes
by written notice to the Issuer shall terminate the 2029 Notes and declare the principal amount of and all accrued interest
under all outstanding 2029 Notes to be due and payable immediately and (ii) upon instruction of Holders of at least 25%
in principal amount of all outstanding 2031 Notes by written notice to the Issuer shall terminate the 2031 Notes and declare
the principal amount of and all accrued interest under all outstanding 2031 Notes to be due and payable immediately. If an
Event of Default with respect to the Issuer pursuant to the foregoing clause (f) occurs and is continuing, the Notes will
automatically be terminated and all payments under the Notes will become due and payable immediately without any
declaration or other act on the part of the Holders’ Representative or any Holder. Certain enforcement actions, including
acceleration, will be suspended during a consultation period under the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default pursuant to foregoing clause (e) has
occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the relevant
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to the foregoing clause (e) shall be remedied or cured by the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness, or the relevant Indebtedness that gave rise to
such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 20 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and if (i) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court
of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium, or interest on
the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

The Holders of the 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes, respectively, may rescind any acceleration with respect to the 2029 Notes
or 2031 Notes, as applicable, and its consequences within three months of the acceleration by simple majority vote of the
relevant Holders if such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction;
_provided, however, that the aggregate of such cast votes exceeds the number of votes having required the acceleration._

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for failure
to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action
and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in “—Covenants—
_Reports”, or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the relevant Conditions of_


-----

Issue shall be deemed to be cured upon delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as
applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the relevant Conditions of Issue.

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the relevant Conditions of Issue or the Notes unless:

(a) such Holder has previously given the Holders’ Representative notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(b) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding 2029 Notes or 2031 Notes, as applicable,
have requested in writing the Holders’ Representative to pursue the remedy;

(c) the Holders’ Representative has not complied with such request within 60 days following the receipt of
the request; and

(d) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding 2029 Notes or 2031 Notes, as applicable,
have not within such 60 day period given the Holders’ Representative a written direction that, in the
opinion of the Holders’ Representative, is inconsistent with such request.

Subject to the relevant Conditions of Issue and applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding 2029 Notes or 2031 Notes, as applicable, are given the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Holders’ Representative or of exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Holders’ Representative.

The Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative for delivery to the Holders in accordance with the procedures set
forth in the Condition of Issue, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (and within 20 Business Days upon request
at any time after the 120 days), an Officers’ Request Certificate stating whether the signers thereof know of any Default
that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is required to deliver to the Holders’ Representative, after becoming
aware of the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute Defaults, their
status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Holders’ Representative may or, subject to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement with respect to any Note Guarantee and the Collateral, the Security Agent may:

(a) in its sole discretion, but shall not be required to, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the Holders
by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Holders’ Representative or the Security Agent, as
applicable, shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific
enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the relevant Conditions of Issue or any Note Guarantee or
in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy, including
making demand under one or more of the Note Guarantees on behalf of the Holders; and

(b) prosecute and enforce all rights of action and claims under the relevant Conditions of Issue or any Note
Guarantee without the possession of any of the Notes or the Global Notes or the production thereof in
any proceeding relating thereto, and to bring any such proceeding on behalf of the Holders.

**Amendments and Waivers**

In accordance with the German Act on Debt Securities of 2009 (Gesetz über Schuldverschreibungen aus Gesamtemissionen
_(Schuldverschreibungsgesetz-SchVG)) the Holders may, by resolution with the majority specified in the following_

resulted from such acceleration) or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or
change the coin or currency in which the principal of any such Note or any premium or the interest

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance**

The relevant Conditions of Issue will provide that the Issuer may, as evidenced by a resolution set forth in an Officers’
Request Certificate, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding
Notes of each series and the Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be deemed to
have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes that are being defeased and Note
Guarantees except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust account referred to below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to exchange any Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes,
maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such payments
in trust;

Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the “Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance” provisions of the relevant Conditions of Issue.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors
released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the relevant Conditions of Issue (“Covenant Defeasance”), and
thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to
the Notes of the relevant series. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under “—Events of
_Default, Enforcement” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes of the relevant series. These_
events do not include events relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it previously
exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(i) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in a trust account for the benefit of the holders
of the Notes of the relevant series, cash in euro, non-callable European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of the Issuer (acting
in good faith), to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, on the outstanding
Notes of the relevant series on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may
be, and the Issuer must (x) prior to depositing such monies or securities to the trust account, procure an


-----

Opinion of Counsel stating, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, that the trust account
will be bankruptcy remote; (y) specify whether the Notes of the relevant series are being defeased to such
Stated Maturity or to a particular redemption date; and (z) if applicable, have delivered to the Holders’
Representative an irrevocable notice to redeem all the outstanding Notes of the relevant series of such
principal, premium, if any, or interest;

(ii) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative an Opinion
of Counsel stating that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the original issue date of the Notes, there has been a change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion
shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes of the relevant series will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will
be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(iii) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes of the relevant series
will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and
at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(iv) the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative an Officers’ Request Certificate stating
that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes of the
relevant series over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or
defrauding creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(v) the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative an Officers’ Request Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating that all conditions
precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with.

The Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to accept any Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel delivered
to it pursuant to this paragraph as sufficient evidence of compliance with the relevant paragraph and shall not be obligated
to independently investigate whether the requirements of the relevant paragraph are otherwise met.

assets occurring in connection with a transaction requiring a calculation to be made hereunder, and which
constitutes all or substantially all of a company, division, operating unit, segment, business, group of
related assets or line of business, Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed Charges for such period shall be
calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the Incurrence of any Indebtedness) as if such
Investment or acquisition occurred on the first day of such period; and

(5) if since the beginning of such period any Person (that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or
was merged with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning of such period) will
have Incurred any Indebtedness or discharged any Indebtedness, made any Asset Disposition or any
Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an adjustment pursuant to clause (3) or (4) of
this definition if made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary during such period, Consolidated EBITDA
and Fixed Charges for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such
Incurrence or discharge of Indebtedness, Asset Disposition or Investment or acquisition of assets

_forma calculations (including, without limitation, in respect of anticipated expense or cost savings and expense or cost_
synergies relating to any such transaction) shall be determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer
of the Issuer. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the interest expense

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**

**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations regarding the European Union, Germany, the Czech
Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom and France. The descriptions below are only a summary and do not purport to be
complete or to discuss all insolvency law considerations that may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer
or any Guarantor. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes”.

**EUROPEAN UNION**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (as last amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/2260 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December
15, 2021, the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union. The Recast
Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings that are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred
to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation.

**_Main insolvency proceedings_**

Pursuant to Article 3 paragraph 1 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union (the “Member
**State”) (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is situated. The “center of main interests”**
is defined as “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties”. Pursuant to Article 3 paragraph 1 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the center of main
interests of a company or legal person is presumed to be located in the Member State of its registered office in the absence
of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member
State within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be
possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than the
one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a
manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the
management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to
creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the
center of main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out
its activities in due course (e.g., by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise
making the new location public through other appropriate means).

If the “center of main interests” of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a Member State
(other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the Recast Insolvency Regulation
would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the
types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory
of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that
derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

**_Secondary insolvency proceedings_**

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the
other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in other Member States. If the
“center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3 paragraph 2 of the
Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open
“secondary” or “territorial” insolvency proceedings only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” in the territory
of such other Member State. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast
Insolvency Regulation and, for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial proceedings
are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings and which
will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main proceedings. “Establishment” is defined as any
place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main
insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial
insolvency proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3 paragraph 4 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in
which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can only
be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot
be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law;


-----

or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of a creditor, whose claim arises from or in connection
with the operation of such establishment, or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the
respective Member State’s law, requests the opening of such proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exemptions, be
governed by the _lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the_
respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the case may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the court of the main
proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him or her by the law of that Member State in another Member State
(such as to remove the debtor’s assets from the territory of the Member State in which they are situated), subject to certain
limitations, so long as no other insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other Member State or any preservation
measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State
where the company has assets.

However, under Article 36 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral
undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be
opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights
under the relevant national law from which the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in
the Member State where the assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a
qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the
undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it
should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceeding if
it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement
proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the
request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency
proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests
of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will
also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner
in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no
interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods.
Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency
proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings will be required
to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor
on grounds of international jurisdiction.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors or any provider of collateral experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible
to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings will be commenced, or the
outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the collateral provided by any other company. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the
jurisdictions in which the respective companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with,
each other and there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be applied
in relation to one another.

That being said, the opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or
third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, movable or immovable assets, both specific assets and collections of
indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time, belonging to the debtor which are situated within the territory
of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings.

Rights in rem may include:

- the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income
from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

- the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by
assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;


-----

- the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary
to the wishes of the party so entitled; and

- a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

**_Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_**

The Recast Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event that insolvency
proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened. Insolvency practitioners appointed in
proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings
concerning another member of the group to the extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has
opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings
concerning another member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective
administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of
interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with
the rules applicable to them.

**GERMANY**

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and,
except for shareholding interests in certain subsidiaries, substantially all of their assets are located in Germany.
Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the Issuer and these certain Guarantors are likely to be initiated
in Germany and, if the Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, were held to have their center of main interests within the
territory of Germany pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation (see “–European Union”) at the time the application
for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely
govern such proceedings. Under certain circumstances, insolvency proceedings may also be opened in Germany in
accordance with German law over the assets of companies that are not established under German law (for example, if the
center of main interests of such company is within Germany) or, vice versa, insolvency over the Issuer or a German
Guarantor may be opened in other jurisdictions. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest as
well as in certain circumstances priority recovery for secured creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and
hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover payments due on the Notes, as applicable, to an extent exceeding the
limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the economic
ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency proceeding for each of
the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency
proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there
is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims
among the respective entities of a group. In this context, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of
group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April
21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group
companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies,
or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or a pooling of claims amongst the respective entities
of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in order to
facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity
insolvency proceeding (Gruppen-Gerichtsstand); (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all
group companies is facilitated (without any obligation of the court to do so); (iii) certain coordination obligations are
imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for
“coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator”
(Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the
coordination court (Koordinationsgericht).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to, claims
made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the return of funds or payment of a consideration), while
claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings
generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. See also below under “— Satisfaction of Subordinated
_Claims”._


-----

Under German insolvency law, (preliminary) insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings. (Preliminary)
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is illiquid, i.e., unable to pay its debts as and when they fall
due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a
debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a
continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) for a
prognosis period covering at least the next twelve (12) months (positive Fortführungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor
is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks,
unless it is virtually certain that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed
acceptable to the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a limited
liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally
liable shareholder—such as the Issuer—becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the management of such company and,
under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue
delay, however, in the case of illiquidity at the latest within three (3) weeks after illiquidity occurred and in the case of
over-indebtedness at the latest within six (6) weeks after over-indebtedness occurred. Non-compliance with these
obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or
over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the Notes, are voidable. In addition, imminent
illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the company
currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in
time within a certain prognosis period (such period generally being 24 months). However, only the management of the
debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings in case of
imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit).

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due performance of
the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take preliminary measures (vorläufige
_Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The_
insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during
these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for the appointment of a preliminary custodian
(vorläufiger Sachwalter) in preparation of a debtor in possession proceeding (Eigenverwaltung)—an insolvency process
in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under the
supervision of a (preliminary) custodian—provided that, inter alia, the debtor has enclosed a comprehensive (vollständig)
and coherent (schlüssig) self-administration plan (Eigenverwaltungsplanung) to the petition for the debtor-in-possession
proceeding and no circumstances are known which indicate that the key aspects of the self-administration plan are based
on inaccurate facts.

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a preliminary creditors’
committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for debtor in possession proceedings or on the
profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed
by the court. A preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) must be set up if the debtor has satisfied
in the previous business year two of the following three requirements: a balance sheet total of at least €6 million (after
deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is over-indebted), sales of at least €12 million in the twelve months prior to the
last balance sheet date and/or fifty or more employees on an annual-average basis. The preliminary creditors’ committee
will be able to participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. For example, the preliminary creditors’
committee will have the ability to influence the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), court orders authorizing debtor-in-possession_
proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung) and appointment of a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter). In
case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding
on the court (unless the suggested individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the
preliminary creditors’ committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does comprise a
representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the
employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the
debtor’s assets (which may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an
insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency
proceedings.

The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if
certain requirements are met, in particular if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) (if the petition has been filed by the debtor), over-indebtedness or illiquidity and (ii) there are_
sufficient assets (Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are
not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties (e.g.,


-----

creditors) advance the costs themselves. A debtor or its representative who was obliged to but did not file for bankruptcy
must pay such costs to enable an opening order. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not necessarily, the same
person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the insolvency court unless a debtor in
possession proceeding (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a debtor in possession proceeding, the right to
administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator
with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency
administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung). Such change requires that (i)
a simple majority of votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed
individual becoming the new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual is eligible as officeholder, _i.e.,_
sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial
indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency
administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any
insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after
realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the Holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of formal
insolvency proceedings against the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are subject to the German
insolvency regime would be the following:

- if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to administer and dispose
of the assets of the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to the
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

- if the court does not order debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the Issuer, such
Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of the Issuer, such Guarantor
or such subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by operation of law;

- if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the Issuer’s,
such Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally form part of the insolvency
estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings; and

- claims against the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in accordance
with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling one party to
terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of insolvency
proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of
insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be ruled invalid by a German
Court if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht
_des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to_
agreements that are not governed by German law.

Any person who has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not constitute part of
the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the
course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency estate
(Aussonderungsrecht) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the
insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings by filing their claims with the insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) or the custodian (Sachwalter) in case of debtor in possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung). German
insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in
the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Any judicial enforcement action (Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor
by any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been opened. Therefore, secured
creditors are generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency
proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal
nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency
administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any


-----

movable assets in his, her or the debtor’s possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets
(Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are
subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the
insolvency administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the
secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate,
usually add up to 9% (or more in certain circumstances) of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed
to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the
remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the preferential creditors of the
insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any preferred
liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after, or with permission of the insolvency court prior to, the opening of formal
insolvency proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of
unsecured creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors remaining after realization of the available
collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate have been settled and paid in full.
Therefore, the proceeds resulting from the realization of the insolvency estate of the debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy
the claims of unsecured creditors in full after the claims of preferred and secured creditors have been satisfied. Claims of
subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims
of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) or to separation (Aussonderungsrecht) may not
necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by
law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the repayment
of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after
the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of
subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims
of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below
under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims”.

It may take several years before an insolvency dividend, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. While in ordinary
insolvency proceedings, the value of the Issuer’s, any Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ assets will be
realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s business as a going concern, a different
approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan
can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain
exceptions, the consent of the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries and the consent of each class of
creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of dissenting
creditors or the debtor can––under certain circumstances––be crammed down). If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the
shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be
transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could
under certain circumstances provide for provisions regarding the Notes, the guarantees or the collateral which are less
favorable to the Holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the
release of the collateral, the release of obligations under the Notes or the contribution of the Notes in exchange for equity.
Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected Holders of the Notes.

Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an insolvency reason other
than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a petition to initiate such process based on
a debtor in possession status and can prove that a restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich
_aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three months to utilize an insolvency plan for the debtor business_
(Schutzschirm). During the respective period granted by the court to prepare the insolvency plan, the creditors’ rights to
enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency
court has to appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to
suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the
suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial).

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon the opening
of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency
administrator or, in case of debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the debtor (with consent of the custodian
(Sachwalter), if necessary, opt for performance.

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession
proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to


-----

insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency proceedings during
applicable voidance periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are successfully voided by the
insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged
transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right
to void transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to
the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the
Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the
payment of any amounts to the Holders of the Notes as well as the granting of Collateral for or providing credit support for
the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator or
custodian under the rules of voidness (Insolvenzanfechtung) as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).
In the event such a transaction is successfully voided (angefochten), the Holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover
or retain any amounts under the Notes or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured
creditors only. If payments have already been made under the Notes or Collateral, any amounts received from a transaction
that had been voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this case, the Holders of the
Notes, as applicable, would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes, as applicable, without preference in
insolvency proceedings.

In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of a
guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be voided
pursuant to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in particular in the following cases:

- any legal act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (Sicherung) or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) for debt if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the
time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that compellingly suggest
that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that
compellingly suggest such illiquidity or filing);

- any legal act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security (Sicherung) or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) for debt to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if such act
was taken (i) during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after such filing, (ii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid
at such time or (iii) during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other
insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that compellingly suggest such detrimental effect);

- a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor
loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or becomes
enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the counterparty to such legal transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing
at the time of the legal transaction;

- any performance (Leistung) rendered by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants
security for a third party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it
was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

- any legal act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of prejudicing its
insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the act knew of such intention
at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or
satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the
act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid
(drohende Zahlungsunfӓhigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; provided that (x) if
the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or
satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the words “imminently illiquid” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in
the preceding sentence have to be replaced by “actually illiquid” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit), so that the
“knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid
(eingetretene Zahlungsunfӓhigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; and (y) the fact that


-----

the creditor concluded a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with, or granted other forms of deferred
payment terms (Zahlungserleichterung) to, the debtor creates a rebuttable presumption that the insolvency creditor
did not have knowledge of the illiquidity of the debtor at the time of such act;

- any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates to the
detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or if the other party had no knowledge of the
debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; provided that, in relation
to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the
management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share
capital, persons or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the
economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of
any of the foregoing persons;

- any legal act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took
place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the
filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of
the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or

- any legal act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a third
party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security or was liable as a guarantor
(Garant) or surety (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid
(subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the conclusion
must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors,
as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors
if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced
the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party”, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had
“knowledge”.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability in the Case of
Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic (Gesetz zur vorübergehenden Aussetzung der Insolvenzantragspflicht und
_zur Begrenzung der Organhaftung bei einer durch die COVID-19-Pandemie bedingten Insolvenz) (the “COVInsAG”),_
however, provides for privileged treatment of new financing and shareholder loans under German insolvency law clawback provisions during a certain time during the COVID-19 pandemic. On that basis, the repayment (including reasonable
interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by September 30, 2023 shall not be considered
disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing was granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and the
debtor fulfilled the requirements for the suspension of the filing duties at the time. This privilege also covers the provision
of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in case of the provision of collateral to secure
the repayment of shareholder loans or receivables resulting from legal transactions which are economically equivalent to a
loan.

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such
be privileged—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)
(Bargeschäftsprivileg) by not being subject to voidness rights.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security right
according to the German Act on Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites
vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor
exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council have adopted a new directive, which aims to ensure that
minimum restructuring measures are available in the Member States to enable debtors in financial distress to solve their
problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings (Directive of the European Parliament and the
Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on


-----

measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive Restructuring Directive”)).

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of the
German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law is
the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilization and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (Gesetz über den
_Stabilisierungs- und Restrukturierungsrahmen) (the “Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act”), which_
establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective
debtor to affected creditors and/or the competent restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens).
Restructuring Proceedings are applicable in cases in which a debtor faces imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), i.e., that there is the imminent risk for the debtor of being unable to pay any of its debt as and when_
it falls due during the course of (regularly) the next 24 months.

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act upon the occurrence
of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor will not be able
to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor’s management is not
obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the debtor may
alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under “—
_Insolvency”)._

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act do not necessarily cover
all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company Stabilization and
Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities, only certain types
(e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and depending on the extent
to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring
Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and the tools can—under certain
circumstances—even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding on affected creditors. The tools
available under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act may in the case of a group of companies only be used
for each entity separately, subject to an important exception that allows the effect of certain tools to be extended to cover
security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor and do not provide for a
consolidation of insolvency proceedings. However, certain German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) provisions that
implement the law that facilitates the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung von Konzerninsolvenzen)
provide for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies and such provisions
apply mutatis mutandis to the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act (see above under “—Insolvency”).

The core component of the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a debtor’s
liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates and/or
maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral granted
for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring plan can
generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or majorities of a
debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan, which can be submitted solely by the debtor, will be voted on in classes. The
adoption of the restructuring plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights
approve the plan (whereas voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the
case of share or membership rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is
formed, the restructuring plan can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved
the plan, provided certain legal requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross_class cramdown)._

The Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor so as to
facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a stabilization order,
among other things, by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilization
order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilization order can initially be granted for a
maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilization order up to a maximum of eight
months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the Holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the Company
Stabilization and Restructuring Act by the Issuer, a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its center of main
interests in Germany would be the following:

- The negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the debtor is potentially subject to no or only limited review
and/or supervision by a court;


-----

- restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight
months due to a stabilization order;

- any claims and rights of the Holder of the Notes can be subject to and potentially be compromised by the
restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal and/or interest or a deferral
and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of the security right);

- any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring Proceedings
potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

- a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any Holder of the Notes
without the consent of each Holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cramdown are fulfilled,
even without the consent of any of the Holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any Member
State (other than Denmark) under the Recast Insolvency Regulation since the German lawmaker decided to include public
restructuring proceedings under the Company Stabilization and Restructuring Act in Exhibit A of said Regulation.
However, this does not apply to plans in non-public restructuring matters under the Company Stabilization and
Restructuring Act, as they are not mentioned in Exhibit A of the Recast Insolvency Regultytion. Except for public
restructuring matters, the recognition of a restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable
international private law.

**_Europe-wide Harmonization of Insolvency Law_**

The German insolvency laws may become subject to further amendment in the future. On December 7, 2022, the European
Commission published a “Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council harmonizing certain
aspects of insolvency law” (COM(2022) 702 final), which seeks to advance the further financial and economic integration
in the European Union. The proposed Directive, _inter alia, proposes (i) detailed minimum requirements for avoidance_
actions; (ii) cross-border rights for the insolvency courts or the insolvency practitioner, respectively, to access certain bank
account and ownership registers for the purpose of tracing the assets belonging to the insolvency estate (“asset tracing”);
(iii) the introduction of pre-pack proceedings intended to facilitate the sale of the debtor’s business or part thereof as a
going concern; (iv) a liability of the directors if they fail to comply with the obligation to file for opening of insolvency
proceedings; (v) simplified winding-up proceedings for insolvent microenterprises; (vi) minimum requirements for the
working methods, function, rights, duties, powers, expenses and remuneration and liability of creditors’ committees; and
(vii) the obligation for each Member State to issue a key information factsheet written in clear, non-technical and
comprehensible language and containing essential information about such Member State’s national insolvency law. The
proposed Directive has gone through several rounds of comments and discussions within the Council or its preparatory
bodies, but has not yet been discussed within the European Parliament. While it will likely not be adopted in its current
draft version, it might affect German insolvency laws in the future and to an extent not yet fully ascertainable.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor on the
date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims
of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal
status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of
the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the
proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal
consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous
performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims
resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to such a loan, unless a state aid bank or any of its
subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company have granted the respective loan or legal transaction
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

**_Insolvency proceedings regarding natural persons_**

The four minority shareholders of the Issuer are natural persons. A natural person is only insolvent in case of an (imminent)
inability to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunfähigkeit); an insolvency based on over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) does not apply to natural persons.

To the extent they do not operate commercially (and have not done so recently), the consumer insolvency proceedings
(Verbraucherinsolvenzverfahren) might apply to the minority shareholders. These are insolvency proceedings based on
three stages: (1) Prior to the filing for insolvency, the debtor has to set up and offer its creditors a plan to settle his debts in


-----

the course of an out-of-court debt-adjustment procedure (außergerichtliches Schuldenbereinigungsverfahren). During this
out-of-court procedure, the general rules apply with respect to an enforcement of security interests, _i.e., there are no_
restrictions on enforcement of security. (2) If the debtor fails to reach a settlement with its creditors, he/she may file for
insolvency. The insolvency court will then initiate an in-court debt-adjustment procedure (gerichtliches
_Schuldenbereinigungsverfahren) in which the court may, under certain circumstances, replace a creditor’s consent to a_
settlement. During this in-court procedure, the preliminary insolvency proceedings (vorläufiges Insolvenzverfahren) are
pending but the court may order preliminary restrictions on enforcement of security which might include the enforcement
of the share pledges. (3) If the in-court procedure also fails, the court may open insolvency proceedings. With respect to
security interests granted by a natural person, the insolvency proceedings do not differ much from the general insolvency
proceedings. The consumer insolvency proceedings may also include an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) but the debtor
may not apply for debtor-in-possession proceeding (Eigenverwaltung). If not the natural person but one of its creditors
files for insolvency over the assets of the natural person, the court allows the natural person/debtor to file for insolvency,
as well. If the debtor does so, he/she has to follow the above mentioned three steps. If the debtor refuses to file for
insolvency, the court may open insolvency proceedings straight away.

Natural persons may under certain circumstances apply to be discharged from all residual debt remaining at the end of an
insolvency proceeding (Restschuldbefreiung) if they agree to assign the seizable part of their wages for a period of generally
three years from the opening of the insolvency proceedings to a court-appointed trustee. If the natural person had already
been granted residual debt discharge once on the basis of an application filed after September 30, 2020, the assignment
period in a new procedure is five years. The insolvency creditors may request the court to deny the discharge based on
certain reasons stated in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). The discharge of all residual debt would not
affect the pledges granted by the minority shareholders as the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) excludes
certain security interests (including pledges) from the effects of the discharge.

An insolvency administrator may void the granting of the pledges by the minority shareholders in the cases described
above, in particular by claiming the minority shareholders did not receive a (sufficient) consideration for providing the
pledges.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

The granting of guarantees and/or Collateral by German Guarantors will be subject to certain German capital maintenance
rules of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
_beschränkter Haftung) (the “GmbHG”) if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a German limited_
liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—a “GmbH”) or a German limited partnership with a German
limited liability company as general partner (a “GmbH & Co. KG”). As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 GmbHG
prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e.,
assets minus liabilities and liability reserves)—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or
would fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Unterbilanz/Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees or security
interests granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent
or sister company are considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31 GmbHG. Moreover, under Section 15b paragraph
1 in connection with paragraph 5 German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), members of the representative body and
liquidators of a legal person who are subject to the obligation to file an application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (antragspflichtige Mitglieder des Vertretungsorgans und Abwickler einer juristischen Person), e.g., a
managing director (Geschäftsführer) of a GmbH, can be held personally liable in certain circumstances for payments to
shareholders that, if made, would render the respective person illiquid. The granting of guarantees and security interests
for the benefit of direct or indirect parent or sister companies of such legal persons, e.g., a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG,
could be considered to constitute such disbursements and payments to shareholders.

In relation to a GmbH & Co. KG the capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules and principles described above
for GmbHs apply, mutatis mutandis, also to the general partners of the GmbH & Co. KGs. Therefore, in order to enable
German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to provide security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent
or sister company without the risk of violating German capital maintenance and/or liquidity maintenance rules and to limit
any potential personal liability (as well as criminal prosecution) of the management, it is standard market practice for notes,
credit agreements, indentures, related guarantees and related security documents to contain so called “limitation language”
in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such
“limitation language”, the beneficiaries of the guarantees contractually agree to enforce the guarantees and security interests
against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s—or, in
case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its
stated share capital.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Guarantee Agreement, to the extent provided by a Guarantor
incorporated in Germany in a relevant corporate form as described above, contains or will contain such contractual


-----

limitation language and such guarantees are limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the
respective guarantee granted by such Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

German capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules are subject to court decisions on an ongoing basis (see, for
example, the more recent decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) dated March 21, 2017, file
no. II ZR 93/16, regarding the preservation of the share capital). Future court decisions may further limit the access of
shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries constituted in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively
affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes or of the German Guarantors to make payments on the related
guarantees.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding
so-called “destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation in which a shareholder deprives its
company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the
enforcement of a guarantee or security interests granted by the Issuer and a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount
of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of
breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor
will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out
that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of guarantees and/or security interests to be granted
by the Issuer and the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated
share capital of the grantor of the guarantee or the security interests could become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example,
the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in
violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the
transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or security interest was close to
collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**_Accessory security interests/Parallel debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature and are therefore
dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the secured claim to be identical. Such
accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is
settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned independently, but would automatically follow the claims they
secure in case the relevant secured claim is assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured
by the accessory security interest.

The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however not a creditor
under the Notes. The Holders of the Notes on the other hand are creditors under the Notes and the Guarantees. In order to
allow the Holders of the Notes to benefit from the pledges, such pledges will also secure a so called “parallel debt”
obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent rather than secure the Holders of the
Notes’ claims under the Notes directly. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the
obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor under the Notes and the Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect
of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant
to the parallel debt, a claim against the Holders of the Notes and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes,
the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a German court. Therefore, it cannot
be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of
invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be
restricted.

Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the Security Agent,
the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may successfully claim that there is no
separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the Holders of the Notes with respect to the secured claims. As a consequence
the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent)
Security Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the security holder upon enforcement of the
pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale of the asset constituting the collateral
through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under
German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other
creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral.
Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in


-----

the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e.,
the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**FRANCE**

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (“soulte”)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to
it. Pledges over securities account may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a
sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way
of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to
the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owners of the pledged securities. If the
secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the
secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined
either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a
contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be
required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so
determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received
by the secured creditors from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors
will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will
be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law.
If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such
auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process
and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined
pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

**_Parallel Debt – Trust_**

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security documents. In order to
permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there will be provided for the creation of "parallel
debt" obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes (the “Principal Obligations”).

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any
payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect
of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security
Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed
by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the
other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in
respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries
of the security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass.
com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a
decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings)
of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of
the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre
_public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or_
artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal
practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can
be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the
legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French
security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a caseby-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the
rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction
will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt creditor
under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled


-----

to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the
Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of
the Parallel Debt.

The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Notes indenture that become particularly important following
defaults or events of default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

The concept of "trust" has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation),
which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvedere)
that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a
creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the
above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition,
so that the concept of "trust" has not been generally recognized under French law.

**POLAND**

**_Overview_**

Progroup Board sp. z o.o. (the “Polish Guarantor”), being a Polish limited liability company (Polish: spółka z ograniczoną
_odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.) is incorporated and existing under the laws of Poland. Comments made below are relevant_
for the Polish limited liability company.

In the event of insolvency of the Polish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Poland. Note, however, that
if the center of main interest of the Polish Guarantor is situated in another European Union member state, the courts of that
state shall have jurisdiction and the insolvency laws of that state shall apply pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of
the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (Official Journal No. L 141 of
June 5, 2015).

If the center of main interest of the Polish Guarantor is situated in Poland, the insolvency proceedings would be governed
by the Bankruptcy Law (Polish: Prawo Upadłościowe) of February 28, 2003 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2022,
item 1520, as amended) (the “Bankruptcy Law”), and a Restructuring Law (Polish: Prawo Restrukturyzacyjne) of May
15, 2015 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2022, item 2309, as amended) (the “Restructuring Law”).

Please find below the general and non-exhaustive description of certain provisions of the Bankruptcy Law and the
Restructuring Law.

Note that the Bankruptcy Law and the Restructuring Law may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the
insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the ability to obtain interest after the
commencement of insolvency proceedings and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability
to recover payments due on the Notes and the Guarantees to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws.

Now in Poland the government works on certain amendments to the Polish insolvency regime connecting with
implementation of the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 20, 2019 on
preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency
of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132
(Directive on restructuring and insolvency).

The current provisions of the Polish insolvency law are largely in line with the basic terms of the Directive. Provisions that
still need to be implemented concern, inter alia, the scope of suspension of individual enforcement actions, approval of a
restructuring plan against the objection of a group of creditors, as well as protection of new financing, interim financing
and other restructuring-related transactions.

**_Insolvent debtor_**

Bankruptcy proceedings under Polish law may be initiated against insolvent debtors.

The debtor is deemed insolvent if it loses the ability to settle its due and payable financial liabilities (which will be presumed
to be the case if a delay in payment exceeds three months).

Under the balance sheet test (for a debtor being a legal person, e.g. a limited liability company), the debtor will be deemed
insolvent if according to its balance sheet, its financial obligations (except for future liabilities, including liabilities subject
to a suspensory condition, and shareholder loans or other legal act having the similar effects made within five years prior


-----

to the declaration of bankruptcy and also expect for liabilities arising from capital instruments and subordinated loans
issued or incurred for the purpose of qualifying for own funds as additional instruments) exceed the value of their assets
and this “negative surplus” continues for longer than twenty four consecutive months. Note that even if the above conditions
are met, the court may reject a bankruptcy petition, provided that there is no threat to the debtor’s ability to perform its due
and payable obligations in a short-term.

**_Bankruptcy petition_**

Bankruptcy proceedings are initiated upon submitting a bankruptcy petition. Such a petition may be submitted by either
the debtor or its personal creditors. In connection with the amendment of the regulations of October 13, 2022 and the
introduction of the so-called holding law, _i.e., new provisions that regulate groups of companies, the entity entitled to_
submit a petition is also the parent company - in relation to the subsidiary company participating in the group of companies.

According to the Bankruptcy Law, the catalogue of persons authorized and obliged to submit a bankruptcy petition for the
debtor has been determined, inter alia, as all persons who on the basis of the law, articles of association/statute of the
company have the right to conduct the company’s affairs and to represent it (e.g., each member of the management board
is individually authorized and obliged to submit a bankruptcy petition). The deadline for submitting the bankruptcy petition
is thirty days from the date on which the reason for bankruptcy occurred.

Note that persons obliged to submit the bankruptcy petition (e.g., management board members) may be held liable for
damages resulting from a delay in submitting the petition to the court. Polish law provides a number of consequences for
failure to comply with this obligation, including personal liability for debts not satisfied by the company, a ban on
conducting economic activity, and even criminal or tax liability.

A member of the management board of an insolvent limited-liability company may be relieved of personal liability for the
company’s obligations if, within the time provided by law for filing a bankruptcy petition, _i.e., within 30 days after_
insolvency arises, a restructuring procedure was opened or an arrangement was approved in a procedure for approval of an
arrangement.

The court is obliged to refuse to initiate bankruptcy proceedings if the debtor’s assets are insufficient to cover the cost of
the proceedings or, additionally if the debtor’s assets are sufficient to cover only the cost of the proceedings. The court
may also reject the petition to declare bankruptcy if the debtor’s assets are encumbered with a mortgage, pledge, registered
pledge, treasury pledge or maritime mortgage to such a degree that the debtor’s remaining assets are not sufficient to cover
the cost of the proceedings.

**_Safeguard procedure before the bankruptcy proceedings_**

Upon receiving a bankruptcy petition, the court can, ex officio or upon a motion, secure the debtor’s assets.

The court may also secure the debtor’s assets, inter alia, through the appointment of an interim court supervisor (Polish:
_tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy) or a mandatory administrator (Polish: zarządca przymusowy), and suspend the execution_
proceedings against the debtor (and additionally the court may revoke seizure of a bank account).

**_Bankruptcy proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, there is one uniform bankruptcy proceedings, i.e., liquidation bankruptcy proceedings.

Upon acceptance of the bankruptcy petition, the court decides whether to initiate the bankruptcy proceedings. This decision
shall be made within two months of submitting the bankruptcy petition, however this deadline is only of instructive nature.

The date of the bankruptcy is the date on which the bankruptcy order is issued by the court.

As a rule, upon the court declaring liquidation bankruptcy, the debtor loses its right to manage its assets and a bankruptcy
receiver (Polish: _syndyk masy upadło´sci) is appointed. Acts in law performed by the bankrupt concerning property_
comprised in the bankruptcy estate are invalid. The financial liabilities of the debtor that have not yet become due and
payable, become due and payable on the day the bankruptcy order is issued. The debtor’s assets become the bankruptcy
estate to be used to settle the debtor’s creditors. The bankruptcy estate is managed by a bankruptcy receiver appointed by
the court. Consent of the creditors’ committee (Polish: zgromadzenie wierzycieli) or the bankruptcy receiver responsible
for administering the bankruptcy is required for specified decisions made in relation to some matters connected with the
bankruptcy process.

As a rule, the preferred type of liquidation under the Bankruptcy Law is the sale of the bankrupt’s business as a whole.


-----

Creditors have the right to submit their claims within thirty days from the announcement of the bankruptcy order; claims
may be submitted also after the lapse of the set deadline, however, all actions undertaken in the bankruptcy proceedings
until that date are valid towards the creditor. If a claim is not included in the list prepared by a court receiver, the creditor
has the right to appeal. The procedural requirements for submitting claims are very formal.

**_Prepared liquidation (so called “pre-pack”)_**

The Bankruptcy Law provides for an institution called prepared liquidation (Polish: przygotowana likwidacja), also called
“pre pack”.

In the pre pack procedure, the bankruptcy petition may be accompanied by an application for approval of the terms of sale
of a debtor’s enterprise, its organized part or assets representing a major part of its enterprise. Nevertheless, it may not
include assets secured with registered pledge if the registered pledge agreement provides for foreclosure of the assets or
their sale to satisfy a pledgee’s claims (unless a pledgee gives its consent).

Such application for approval of terms of sale must specify at least the sale price and a potential purchaser, and be
accompanied by a valuation report prepared by a certified court expert.

It is possible to request that the debtor’s enterprise will be handed over to the purchaser on the bankruptcy declaration day,
in which case the full price will have to be paid in advance to the court’s deposit account. Note that the sale to an affiliated
company of the debtor is permissible only at a price not lower than the price indicated in the valuation report.

The court is obliged to accept the application if the offered price is higher than the estimated liquidation proceeds that could
be raised in “standard” bankruptcy proceedings, less the estimated costs of the proceedings. If the offered price is lower
than (but still close to) the estimated net liquidation proceeds, the court will still be in a position to approve the sale if it is
supported by an “important social interest” or if it allows the distressed enterprise to be preserved.

Submission of the application for pre-pack sale is publicly announced. In case of submission of two or more applications
for pre-pack sale, an auction between the potential buyers is held to select the most favorable terms of sale.

The court’s decision to dismiss the pre-pack application may be appealed by the debtor and the applicant, whereas the
decision approving pre-packed sale may be appealed by the debtor and each of the creditors. The appeal may be lodged
within two weeks from the date of publication of the said decision in the National Register of Debtors.

**_Ineffectiveness of some legal acts with respect to the bankruptcy estate_**

Following the declaration of bankruptcy, the bankrupt’s assets become the bankruptcy estate, which serves to satisfy the
claims of the bankrupt’s creditors. The bankruptcy estate covers, subject to exceptions, the assets belonging to the insolvent
debtor on the date of the bankruptcy or acquired by it during the bankruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Law lists assets
that are excluded from the bankruptcy estate by virtue of law, while other assets of the debtor can be excluded from the
bankruptcy estate by a resolution of the creditors’ committee or through the proceedings reviewed by the judge
commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz).

Under the Bankruptcy Law, contractual provisions which provide for a change or termination of a legal relationship, to
which the bankrupt is a party to, due to the declaration of bankruptcy (or in the case of filling a petition for bankruptcy),
are null and void. Furthermore, contractual provisions, which make it impossible or difficult to achieve the objective of the
bankruptcy proceedings, are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate.

Legal transactions are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if concluded by the bankrupt within one year preceding
the day, on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted and resulting in the bankrupt disposing of its assets: (i) without
any reciprocal consideration for the bankrupt or (ii) bankrupt’s consideration significantly exceeds the value of the
consideration received by the bankrupt or reserved for the bankrupt or a third party.

Also ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate is granting of collateral for an undue debt and the payment of such debt
effected by the insolvent debtor in six months preceding the day, on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted. The
beneficiaries of such actions may, however, aim to have these transactions considered effective, if they have not been aware
of grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy while receiving payment or being granted the collateral.

Moreover, in relation to non-gratuitous legal transactions concluded by an insolvent legal person with its shareholders,
representatives (including their spouses), as well as affiliated companies, their shareholders or representatives (including
their spouses) executed within six months before the day on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted, the judge
commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz) is entitled to declare them ineffective (ex officio or upon a motion) unless the party
to such legal transaction demonstrates that such transaction was not to the creditors’ detriment.


-----

In addition, a transfer of future receivable is ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if such receivable arises after the
declaration of bankruptcy, unless the agreement on the transfer of receivable was concluded in writing with a certified date
(Polish: forma pisemna z datą pewną) at least six months before the day on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted.

Mortgages, pledges, registered pledges or maritime mortgages established by the bankrupt within one year preceding the
day on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted may be challenged in one of the following situations: (i) the bankrupt
was not the personal debtor of the creditor (e.g. if the debtor was a guarantor) and the bankrupt did not receive any
consideration in connection with such security, (ii) the consideration received was substantially lower than the value of the
security, or (iii) the security interests was established for the benefit of its shareholders, representatives (including their
spouses), as well as affiliated companies, their shareholders or representatives (including their spouses). The judge
commissioner, acting upon a motion, is competent to decide on the ineffectiveness of the established security towards the
bankruptcy estate, however in case described in point (iii) above it is obliged to decide on such ineffectiveness unless the
party to such legal transaction demonstrates that it was not to the creditors’ detriment.

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, the judge commissioner, is authorized to deem ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate
any contractual penalty (reserved for non-performance or improper performance of obligations) if the obligation was
already performed to a large extent or the contractual penalty is excessive.

The transfer of the ownership title to a thing, claim or other right to the creditor (Polish: przewłaszczenie na zabezpieczenie)
is effective towards the bankruptcy estate if such agreement has been made in writing with a certified date.

A credit agreement expires on the date bankruptcy is declared if prior to that date the lender did not disburse the funds to
the bankrupt. The lender may pursue a claim in the bankruptcy proceedings for compensation by filing the claim with the
judge commissioner. If only a portion of the funds was disbursed to the bankrupt prior to the date of declaring bankruptcy,
the bankrupt loses the right to request the disbursement of the remaining balance.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not affect the bankrupt’s bank account agreement, securities account agreement, account
agreement for derivatives, clearing account or collective account agreement.

**_Other selected consequences of bankruptcy_**

After the declaration of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy estate, as a general rule, cannot be encumbered with a mortgage, pledge,
registered pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime mortgage in order to secure a liability incurred before the declaration of
bankruptcy. Additionally, it is forbidden to encumber the bankruptcy estate with a compulsory mortgage or a treasury
pledge in order to secure a liability that arises after the declaration of bankruptcy.

The effectiveness of contractual subordination arrangements under Polish law is not definitively established either in
legislation or in the case law. The contractual subordination of claims will be binding between the relevant parties (in
accordance with and subject to governing law) but will not be recognized by an insolvency officer (in the event of
insolvency proceedings in Poland) or a court bailiff (in the event of court enforcement proceedings in Poland), who will be
bound by the statutory order of payments and ranking of claims.

Declaration of bankruptcy proceedings affects current court or administrative proceedings and debt collection proceedings.
After declaration of the bankruptcy order, courts and administrative proceedings related to the bankruptcy estate may be
opened and continued only by a bankruptcy receiver or against him. Enforcement proceeding concerning a claim subject
to filing to the bankruptcy estate, opened before the bankruptcy has been declared, shall be stayed by the virtue of law as
at the date bankruptcy is declared. Enforcement proceeding shall be discontinued by the virtue of law after the decision
declaring bankruptcy becomes final.

**_Satisfaction of claims in bankruptcy proceedings_**

In the case of bankruptcy, settling the creditors’ claims is usually only possible upon the registration of the claims by the
bankruptcy receiver. The claims are satisfied according to certain priorities. The costs of bankruptcy proceedings are
covered by separate legal provision, which sets out that costs of bankruptcy proceedings shall be satisfied on an ongoing
basis during the process of liquidation, with priority over the first category claims. Claims described in the below categories
are settled only after all costs of the bankruptcy proceedings, debts of bankruptcy estate have been settled.

Unsecured creditors’ claims are settled in the following order (as far as a legal person is concerned):

- first category—this category, inter alia, covers claims arising out of an employment relationship falling due and
payable before the bankruptcy was declared, with certain exceptions, certain contributions to the social security
insurance system, certain claims which arise during restructuring proceedings, claims arising from credit, loans,
bonds, guarantees or letters of credit or other financing arrangement provided in the approved restructuring


-----

proceedings and granted in connection with the performance of such arrangement (if the bankruptcy was declared
as a recognition of a bankruptcy petition submitted not later than three months after the final repeal of such
restructuring arrangement).

- second category—covers claims not covered in other categories including claims payable to private creditors as
well as tax liabilities, other public levies and contributions to the social security insurance system. Thus, private
creditors within this category are treated equally with tax authorities.

- third category—covers subordinated interest on claims included in the senior categories in the order, in which
they are paid on the capital, as well as judicial and administrative fines and claims arising under donations and
legacies.

- fourth category—covers shareholders’ claims arising from loan agreements as well as other legal transactions
with similar effects, which were executed within five years before the bankruptcy announcement was made,
including interest (with some exceptions).

In the case of brokerage houses (referred to in Article 95 (1) item 1 and 3 of the Act of July 29, 2005 on trading in financial
instruments), the receivables are divided into the categories described above, and in addition into:

- fifth category – receivables from liabilities incurred for the purpose of their qualification as additional instruments
in Tier I to the brokerage house's own funds, referred to in Article 51 of the EU Regulation No. 575/2013, in
respect of which the Polish Financial Supervision Commission has not granted the consent referred to in Article
110ea (1) of the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments of July 29, 2005, together with interest and enforcement
costs;

- sixth category – receivables from liabilities qualified as Tier II instruments to the brokerage house's own funds,
as referred to in Article 62 of the EU Regulation No. 575/2013, together with interest and enforcement costs;

- seventh category seven – receivables from liabilities qualified as additional Tier I instruments to the brokerage
house's own funds, as referred to in Article 51 of the EU Regulation No. 575/2013, together with interest and
enforcement costs.

Settling claims from one of these categories is only possible after fully settling claims of the creditors from a more senior
category. If settling all debts included in the same category is not possible due to lack of assets, the debts should be settled
proportionally.

**_Liquidation of the bankruptcy estate_**

The liquidation of the bankruptcy estate is performed by selling the bankrupt’s enterprise as a whole or by organized parts,
by selling all immovable and movable property, by enforcing claims against the debtors of the bankrupt, and by exercising
other proprietary rights included in the bankruptcy estate or by alienation thereof.

The Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between three types of sale (i.e., at an arm’s length basis, at an auction or at a tender).
The sale (transfer) of receivables is permissible. As stated above, as a rule, the bankrupt’s enterprise should be sold as a
whole.

Proceeds obtained from the liquidation of assets, liabilities and rights encumbered with a mortgage, a pledge or security
transfer of title, registered pledge, treasury pledge, maritime mortgages are allocated to settle creditors’ claims that are
secured by such assets, liabilities or rights (subject to certain exceptions). Proceeds remaining after settling those creditors’
claims are included in the bankruptcy estate and satisfied in accordance with categories of claims specified above. The
foreclosure of the object encumbered with registered pledge or financial pledge is generally permitted if the relevant
agreement provides for such method of satisfaction of creditor’s claim. However, the foreclosure is not allowed if such
object is the part of bankrupt’s enterprise and the sale of such object with the rest of the enterprise is more beneficial than
its separate sale.

The proceedings will be closed by the court upon the performance of the final distribution plan. The court also orders
termination of bankruptcy proceedings if all creditors have been satisfied in the course of the proceedings. The court shall
discontinue the bankruptcy proceeding if (i) the property that remains after excluding the bankrupt’s assets encumbered
with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, tax pledge or marine mortgage is not sufficient to satisfy the costs of
proceedings (ii) creditors that were obliged by a resolution of the meeting of creditors or decision of the judge in charge of
bankruptcy proceedings to make an advance payment on account of the costs of proceedings fail to make such payment in
due time and there are no other liquid funds to cover such costs (iii) all creditors who declared their claim seek


-----

discontinuation of proceedings and the bankrupt entity agree to that. In some cases, liquidation may be avoided through
arrangement with creditors and the company can continue to operate.

**_Debts currency and interest due in the bankruptcy proceedings_**

Any debt payable in a currency other than Polish zloty (such as euro), if being put on the list of debts, must be converted
into Polish zloty at the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate for the date the bankruptcy court issues a decision
on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the debt has fallen due or not). Nevertheless, an inclusion of a debt
payable in currency other than Polish zloty in the list of bankruptcy claims does not result in conversion of such claim into
claim denominated in Polish zloty.

Furthermore, in case of unsecured claims, interest is satisfied from the assets of the bankruptcy estate only for the time
period until the date the bankruptcy is declared.

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

In order to enable insolvent or threatened with insolvency debtors to recover their ability to overcome financial difficulties,
rather than declare bankruptcy, four types of restructuring proceedings are provided by the Restructuring Law:

- proceedings for approval of an arrangement (Polish: postępowanie o zatwierdzenie układu),

- accelerated arrangement proceedings (Polish: przyspieszone postępowanie układowe),

- arrangement proceedings (Polish: postępowanie układowe),

- remedial proceedings (Polish: postępowanie sanacyjne).

The above proceedings are aimed at the debtor concluding an arrangement with its creditors (including partial
arrangements), which enable the debtor to satisfy the creditors’ claims and operate further. The difference in the said
proceedings is in the scope of the debtor’s rights to manage its assets, and the scope of the debtors’ protection against the
creditors. Proceedings, subject to certain exceptions, are initiated by the debtor only (however also a personal creditor is
entitled to file a petition for the commencement of remedial proceedings in relation to an insolvent legal person).

The creditors may vote in single or separate groups. If creditors vote in a single group, the arrangement is concluded if it
is accepted by the majority of voting creditors who hold in aggregate at least two thirds of the total sum of claims held by
the voting creditors.

The creditors may be split into separate groups (classes) based on the criteria of common “category of interests”. In such
case, the arrangement is concluded if it is accepted in each group by a majority of voting creditors in the group whose
claims amount to (in aggregate) at least two thirds of the total sum of claims held by the voting group members. Even if
there is no required majority in one or more of the groups of creditors, the arrangement will still be deemed concluded if:
(i) the creditors representing in aggregate at least two thirds of the total sum of claims held by the voting creditors have
voted in favor of the arrangement, and (ii) the creditors from the dissenting group/groups are satisfied through the
arrangement to an extent which is not less favorable than in the case of liquidation of the debtor.

An arrangement accepted by the required majority of creditors is subject to an approval by the court. The court rejects the
arrangement if: (i) it violates the law or (ii) it is obvious that the arrangement will not be performed. The court is also
entitled to reject the arrangement if it is obviously detrimental to creditors who voted against it and raised objections. The
accepted arrangement is binding on all creditors, whose receivables are, under the law, covered by the arrangement, which
may include claims not specified on the creditor’s list.

In case of conflicting petitions for bankruptcy and for restructuring, the court withholds the bankruptcy petition and the
restructuring petition should be considered first (if the restructuring petition is accepted, it will not be possible to declare
bankruptcy as long as restructuring proceedings are pending). Exceptionally, if the withholding of the bankruptcy petition
should be contrary to the interest of all creditors, the bankruptcy court may decide to consider both petitions at the same
time.

As a general rule, the arrangement covers, subject to some exceptions, all personal claims against the debtor originated
prior to the commencement of the restructuring proceedings (the day of issuing a court’s decision on the opening of
accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings and/or remedial proceedings (the “Commencement
**Date”), in case of proceedings for approval of an arrangement the consequences of commencing the restructuring**
proceedings take effect from the arrangement day), together with interest accruing from the Commencement Date, as well


-----

as conditional claims, if the condition fulfils when the arrangement is being performed. Above relates both to financial and
non-financial claims (except for inter alia, claims under employment agreements or claims for the handover of property).
If a creditor objects to the restructuring of its non-financial claim (or if due the nature of a non-financial claim, it is not
possible to restructure it), the relevant claim will be converted to a financial one (with effect from the Commencement
Date). In addition, claims under reciprocal agreements (Polish: umowy wzajemne) which have not been executed in whole
or in part before the Commencement Date are covered by the arrangement only if: (i) the counterparty’s performance is
divisible and (ii) only to the extent that the counterparty has performed the agreement prior to the Commencement Date of
the restructuring proceedings and has not received a reciprocal consideration from the debtor.

Restructuring proceedings, as in the case of bankruptcy proceedings, have been conducted since December 1, 2021 within
the National Debtors Register (Polish: Krajowy Rejestr Zadłużonych), an IT system in which the files of proceedings are
maintained in electronic form and via which voting on arrangements is conducted. The National Debtors Register is also
used for filing all applications in the proceedings, voting at the creditors' meeting and conducting insolvency searches by
everyone in Poland. In addition, the provisions of the Restructuring Law allow the organization of virtual creditors'
meetings.

**“Partial” arrangements**

The debtor may enter into a “partial” arrangement (Polish: układ częściowy) only with selected classes of creditors (e.g.,
secured creditors or significant suppliers), however, it is permitted only in (i) an arrangement approval proceeding and (ii)
accelerated arrangement proceedings. It should allow the debtor to reach an arrangement in a faster and more discreet way.
However, the selection of creditors for that purpose must be compliant with statutory tests (i.e., it must be based on
objective, unambiguous and economically justified criteria) and must not be only aimed at eliminating dissenting creditors
from relevant voting classes.

**_Impact of restructuring proceedings on certain agreements_**

Contractual provisions, according to which termination or modification of legal relationship, is triggered by submitting a
petition for the commencement of restructuring proceedings or commencement of such proceedings are void by virtue of
law. Also, the terms of agreements with the debtor which make it impossible or difficult to achieve the purposes of
restructuring proceedings (except for arrangement approval proceedings), are ineffective against the debtor’s estate.

In principle, upon the commencement of restructuring proceedings, it is prohibited to terminate certain agreements which
constitute source of incomes for the debtor (unless the board of creditors agrees for the termination), such as tenancy or
lease agreements relating to the premises in which the debtor’s enterprise is operated, property insurances, facility
agreements (but only in relation to funds made available to the debtor before the Commencement Date), leasing agreements,
bank account agreements, suretyships, licences granted to the debtor, guarantees and letters of credit issued before the
Commencement Date.

**_Preservation of security interests in restructuring proceedings_**

As a rule, it is not possible to establish new security interests to secure a claim not covered by the arrangement (unless the
board of creditors agrees otherwise) once the restructuring proceedings have commenced. However, if an application to
register a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge or maritime mortgage is filed more than six months before
submitting a petition to commence restructuring proceedings, the mortgage or pledge will be registered (in accelerated
arrangement, arrangement and remedial proceedings).

Also, according to a general rule, in rem security interests (e.g., mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, security assignment)
securing a claim not covered by the arrangement survive the restructuring proceedings and the claims secured by any of
such security interests are not affected by the arrangement. Hence, the arrangement covers secured claims to the extent
such claims are not covered by the value of collateral, or the relevant secured creditors agree to be covered by the
arrangement. Secured creditors consenting to the arrangement may be assigned to a separate group (class) of creditors and
be afforded different treatment in the arrangements from the one of unsecured creditors.

However, if the debtor presents arrangement proposals to a secured creditor providing for full satisfaction of the creditor’s
claims within the time limit specified in the arrangement, together with incidental claims provided for in the agreement
under which the security was established, even if the agreement has been effectively terminated or has expired, or providing
for satisfaction of the creditor to a degree not lower than what could be expected from enforcing the claim and incidentals
out of the collateral, the consent of such creditor is not necessary for the claim to be covered by the arrangement by
operation of law.


-----

**_Proceedings for approval of an arrangement_**

These proceedings are available if the sum of disputed claims does not exceed fifteen per cent of the total claims held by
creditors entitled to vote. The proceedings for approval of an arrangement include:

- Conclusion by the debtor of an agreement with a restructuring adviser (arrangement supervisor),

- Publication by the arrangement supervisor of a notice on setting of the arrangement date in the National Debtors
Register (optional action),

- Solicitation of votes by the arrangement supervisor (voting on the arrangement),

- The debtor’s submission of an application to the court to approve the arrangement,

- Issuance by the court of an order approving the arrangement.

The proceeding for approval of an arrangement is mostly conducted outside of court. The court becomes involved only
upon filing of the application to approve the arrangement.

The proceedings are opened automatically by virtue of a unilateral action of a debtor (without any involvement of the
court)—i.e., upon concluding by the debtor an agreement on supervising the procedure with a chosen supervisor (a licensed
restructuring advisor). Subsequently, the debtor sets the arrangement date as of which the creditors’ rights to vote on the
arrangement are determined. Claims arising after the arrangement date are not covered by the arrangement.

Once the proceedings are initiated, the supervisor may publish a notice on setting of the arrangement date in the National
Debtors Register. The debtor enjoys far-reaching protection against execution: during the period from publication of the
notice setting the arrangement date, execution proceedings pending against the debtor are stayed by operation of law, and
new execution proceedings may not be initiated. Actions by the debtor outside the ordinary course of business require the
consent of the arrangement supervisor to be valid.

There is a ban on termination of key contracts, such as leases on premises or real estate where the debtor operates its
business, credit agreements with respect to funds transferred to the debtor before announcement of the arrangement date,
and other contracts of fundamental importance for conducting the debtor’s business.

In proceedings for approval of an arrangement, the ban on payment of claims covered by the arrangement does not apply—
unlike in other types of restructuring proceedings, where there is such a ban.

Creditors may apply to the court to set aside in their entirety the effects of announcement of establishment of the
arrangement date, including the ban on execution against the debtor’s assets, if they will cause injury to the creditors.

An application for approval of the arrangement must be filed with the court no later than four months after the
announcement establishing the arrangement date. If the application is not filed within this time, the effects of the
announcement will expire (the proceeding for approval of the arrangement will continue, but without the protective
consequences and without restrictions on debtor’s management).

**_Accelerated arrangement proceedings_**

Similarly, to proceedings for approval of an arrangement, these proceedings are available if the sum of disputed claims
also does not exceed fifteen per cent of the total claims held by creditors entitled to vote. It may be used, in particular, if
there is a large number of creditors and the debtor is unable to collect their votes on the arrangement by itself.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for the acceptance and approval of the arrangement together with a statement
that information included therein is true and complete. The court issues a decision whether to accept and approve the
arrangement within one week from submitting the petition and appoints (i) a court supervisor (Polish: nadzorca sądowy),
who will supervise the debtor’s management of its assets and (ii) a judge commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz), who
inter alia will manage the restructuring proceedings, supervise the activity of the court supervisor and—if applicable—(iii)
the administrator. If the court refuses to commence accelerated arrangement proceedings, the debtor may lodge a complaint
against it. The creditors, in turn, may lodge a complaint against the commencement of the accelerated arrangement
proceedings.

Within 2 weeks from the date on which the accelerated arrangement proceedings are commenced, the court supervisor
prepares and submits to the judge commissioner (i) a restructuring plan, (ii) a list of claims and (iii) a list of disputed claims


-----

providing them with (i) arrangement proposals, (ii) information on division of the creditors on the grounds of their category
of interests, as well as on (iii) a manner of way of voting at the creditors’ meeting. Subsequently, the judge commissioner
sets the date of the creditors’ meeting for the purpose of voting on the arrangement and informs of that date the creditors,
who are on the list of claims.

The debtor continues to manage its assets under the supervision of the court supervisor (optionally the court may appoint
an administrator (Polish: zarządca) to take over the management of the arrangement estate) but the debtor is required to
obtain the supervisor’s consent for all transactions and actions exceeding the scope of the ordinary course of business, as
otherwise those transactions and actions are null and void (the consent may be also issued by the supervisor within 30 days
upon such transaction - ex post ratification procedure). The court may revoke the debtor’s management of assets and
establish an administrator if: (i) the debtor does not comply with the judge commissioner’s or the court supervisor’s
directions, (ii) its management does not guarantee the performance of the arrangement or if a trustee (Polish: kurator) has
been appointed for the debtor or (iii) the debtor’s management does not comply with law (whether intentionally or not) to
the detriment (actual or potential) of the creditors.

In addition, once the accelerated arrangement proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) the estate which enables the debtor
to operate its undertaking and the debtor’s estate become the arrangement estate (Polish: masa układowa), (ii) the debtor
provides the judge commissioner and the court supervisor with information and documents concerning the debtor’s
undertaking and assets, (iii) execution proceedings relating to claims covered by the arrangement are suspended by virtue
of law, (iv) the debtor/administrator may not settle performances from the claims, which are covered by the arrangement
when the proceedings are pending (to some extend this rule does not apply to contractual compensation clauses (Polish:
_klauzula kompensacyjna))._

**_Arrangement proceedings_**

These proceedings are available only for the debtors, whose disputed claims exceed fifteen per cent of the total claims held
by creditors entitled to vote and, as a result, both types of previous proceedings cannot be initiated.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for the acceptance and approval of the arrangement without attaching the
arrangement proposals. The debtor needs to demonstrate in the petition the probability of settling by the debtor the costs
of the proceedings and fulfilling liabilities which will arise after the commencement of arrangement proceedings. In
principle, the court issues a decision whether to accept and approve the arrangement within two weeks from submitting the
petition (this period may be extended to six weeks if it is necessary to conduct a trial).

The court also appoints a court supervisor (Polish: nadzorca sądowy), who will supervise the debtor’s management of its
assets and a judge commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz), who will manage the restructuring proceedings and supervise
the activities of the court supervisor and, if applicable, the administrator (Polish: zarządca).

The court may: (i) secure the debtor’s assets through the appointment of an interim court supervisor (Polish: tymczasowy
_nadzorca sądowy) for the period between the filing of the petition and the commencement of the proceedings, (ii) suspend_
pending enforcement proceedings conducted in order to enforce claims covered with the arrangement and (iii) revoke the
seizure of the debtor’s bank account at the request of the debtor or the interim court supervisor. The debtor or the creditor
who is in the course of conducting the enforcement may lodge a complaint against the court’s decision to suspend pending
enforcement proceedings and to revoke the seizure of the debtor’s bank account. If the court decides to revoke the seizure
of the debtor’s bank account, it needs to appoint an interim court supervisor, who will give consent to the debtor’s
dispositions regarding the sums maintained on this bank account.

Within thirty days from the commencement of the arrangement proceedings, the court supervisor: (i) prepares and submits
to the judge commissioner a restructuring plan and a list of claims, (ii) determines the composition of the arrangement
estate (Polish: _masa układowa) by preparing a specification of inventory (Polish:_ _spis inwentarza) together with an_
estimation of the arrangement estate. Upon the receipt of the restructuring plan and the list of claims, the judge
commissioner sets the date of the creditors’ meeting for the purpose of voting on the arrangement and informs the creditors
of that date providing them with (i) arrangement proposals, (ii) information on division of the creditors on the grounds of
their category of interests as well as on (iii) a manner of way of voting at the creditors’ meeting.

The debtor continues to manage its assets under the supervision of the court supervisor (optionally the court may appoint
an administrator to take over the management of the arrangement estate) but the debtor is required to obtain the supervisor’s
consent for all transactions and actions exceeding the scope of the ordinary course of business, as otherwise those
transactions and actions are null and void (the consent may be also issued by the supervisor within 30 days upon such
transaction - ex post ratification procedure). The court may revoke the debtor’s management if: (i) the debtor does not
comply with the judge commissioner’s directions, (ii) its management does not guarantee the performance of the
arrangement or (iii) its management does not comply with the law (whether intentionally or not) to the detriment (actual
or potential) of the creditors.


-----

In addition, once the arrangement proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) execution proceedings relating to claims
covered by the arrangement are suspended by virtue of law, (ii) the creditors may initiate judicial, administrative or judicial
administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts (Polish: _sądy polubowne) regarding satisfaction of_
claims disclosed in the specification of inventory, (iii) the court supervisor accedes by virtue of law to pending judicial,
administrative or judicial administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts regarding the arrangement
estate.

**_Remedial proceedings_**

This type of proceedings provides for the broadest scope of restructuring activities and protection against creditors. Unlike
other types of restructuring proceedings, it may be also initiated by the debtor’s personal creditor (Polish: _wierzyciel_
_osobisty) provided that debtor has become insolvent and is not only threatened with the insolvency or a trustee (Polish:_
_kurator), if appointed by the registry court._

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for commencing remedial proceedings. As mentioned before, a petition against
an insolvent legal parson may also be submitted by its personal creditor. The debtor needs to demonstrate in the petition
the probability of settling by the debtor the costs of the proceedings and fulfilling liabilities which will arise after the
commencement of remedial proceedings. The court may secure the debtor’s assets through the appointment of an interim
court supervisor (Polish: tymczasowy nadzorca sądowy) or an interim administrator (Polish: tymczasowy zarządca) for the
period between the filing of the petition and the commencement of the proceedings. In principle, the court issues a decision
whether to commence remedial proceedings within two weeks from submitting the petition (this period may be extended
to six weeks if it is necessary to conduct a hearing). The court appoints a judge commissioner (Polish: sędzia komisarz),
who will manage the proceedings and supervise the activities of the administrator (Polish: zarządca). The appointment of
an administrator to manage the debtor’s estate (remedial estate) is mandatory unless the debtor’s involvement is necessary
to conduct successful restructuring and the debtor guarantees proper management (in which case the court may agree to
the debtor’s retaining management over the whole or a part of the undertaking).

Once the court issues the decision on the commencement of remedial proceedings, the debtor is obliged to pass the whole
estate and documents related thereto to the administrator (unless the debtor has been given the right to manage its assets),
and provide the judge commissioner and the administrator with all necessary or required information. Subsequently the
administrator, in cooperation with the debtor, submits a restructuring plan to the judge commissioner within thirty days
from the commencement of the proceedings (this period may be extended to three months), who accepts and approves the
restructuring plan upon obtaining, the opinion of the board of creditors (Polish: _rada wierzycieli). After obtaining the_
approval, the administrator performs the restructuring plan.

In addition, once the remedial proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) commercial power of attorney (Polish: prokura)
and other powers of attorney granted by the debtor expire by virtue of law (in the course of remedial proceedings new
commercial power of attorney or powers of attorney may be granted by the administrator), (ii) the administrator is granted
the right to “cherry-pick” so-called mutual contracts (Polish: umowy wzajemne) which have not been performed in full or
in part prior to the Commencement Date, subject to the judge commissioner’s consent. (ii) the estate which enables the
debtor to operate and the debtor’s estate becomes the remedial estate (Polish: masa sanacyjna), whose components are
determined by the administrator by means of preparing a specification of inventory (Polish: spis inwentarza) together with
an estimation of the remedial estate (Polish: ustalenie składu masy sanacyjnej), within thirty days from the commencement
of the proceedings, (iii) it is possible to adjust the employment level to the needs of the reorganized undertaking, (iv)
opened inheritance to which the debtor is appointed, is included in the remedial estate, (v) pending enforcement proceedings
relating to remedial estate are suspended by virtue of law, (vi) the creditors may initiate judicial, administrative or judicial
administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts (Polish: sądy polubowne) which regard satisfaction of
claims disclosed in the specification of inventory, (vii) judicial, administrative or judicial administrative proceedings or
proceedings before arbitration courts regarding the remedial estate may be initiated by or conducted against the
administrator, in such case the administrator acts in his/her own name but on behalf of the debtor, (viii) at the request of
the debtor, the judge commissioner may revoke the seizure of elements included in the remedial estate in the course of
enforcement or proceedings aimed at securing claims (Polish: _postępowanie zabezpieczające), if such elements are_
necessary for the debtor to operate.

Also, certain legal transactions are ineffective towards the remedial estate once the remedial proceedings are commenced.
These are: (i) transactions by means of which the debtor has disposed of its assets, if they were concluded by the debtor
within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings was submitted
and the value of the debtor’s performance (Polish: świadczenie) significantly exceeds the value of the performance received
by or reserved for the debtor, (ii) security interests, which have not been established directly in connection with receiving
a performance by the debtor within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial
proceedings was submitted (iii) security interests, which have been established by the debtor within one year preceding the
day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings was submitted in the extent such security
interests exceed more than the half of the value of secured performance received by or reserved for the debtor together with


-----

claims for ancillary claims on the day of establishing such security interests. The above rules also apply to guarantees,
suretyships (Polish: poręczenia) and to other similar activities performed to secure performances.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests**

Comments made below are relevant for the Polish Guarantor, being the Polish limited liability company.

**_Governing law and enforceability_**

In the event of subjecting the Polish Guarantor’s Guarantees and Collateral to the laws of Germany in a dispute before a
Polish court, only substantive laws of Germany will be applied (subject to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008
of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 17, 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I))
while the laws of procedure will be governed by Polish law. Furthermore, as a rule, Polish courts can refuse to apply or
execute foreign legal provisions, if the application of such provisions results in the contravention of peremptory rules of
Polish public policy, or if specific law has to be applied regardless of the choice of law (e.g., should any rights in rem be
involved, they will be subject to the laws of the country in which the subject of these rights is located).

As a general rule, the decisions of Polish courts become final and non-appealable after execution of appropriate remedy
path or after the expiry of the statutory term to file a remedy, subject to applicability of extraordinary legal remedies if
available.

The decisions issued by foreign courts, as the general rule, become enforceable in Poland after establishing their
enforceability by the Polish court. The Polish court may refuse to declare the enforceability of the decision of the foreign
court, inter alia, if the decision is in contravention of peremptory rules of Polish public policy.

As a general rule, the decisions of the courts of other EU member states do not need to be declared enforceable by the
Polish courts, prior to their enforcement in Poland. Enforceability of these decisions may be challenged, however, in a
separate proceeding before the Polish court.

As a general rule, decisions of the Polish courts (including on issuance of enforceability clause) and appropriate actions of
enforcement officers with whom the enforcement of claims is sought may be, depending on the circumstances, required
for the enforcement of the given security interest.

**_Insolvency as a result of an excess of obligations over the value of the company’s assets_**

Obligations of the Polish Guarantor under the Notes and the Guarantees and Collateral are subject to limitations resulting
from the application of provisions of the Polish Bankruptcy Law.

As already specified above, in addition to the “liquidity test” limited liability companies may also be deemed insolvent
under the “balance sheet test” if their financial obligations exceed the value of their assets and this “negative surplus”
continues to exist for longer than twenty four consecutive months (except for future liabilities, including liabilities subject
to a suspensory condition, and shareholder loans or other legal act having the similar effects made within five years prior
to declaration of the debtor’s bankruptcy). Nevertheless, even if the above conditions are met, the court may reject a
bankruptcy petition, provided that there is no threat to the debtor’s ability to perform its due and payable obligations in a
short-term.

**_Actio Pauliana_**

Polish civil law provides a basis for declaring some actions done to the detriment of creditors ineffective (so called “actio
_Pauliana”). In general, if as a result of a legal act performed by a debtor to the detriment of creditors, a third party gains a_
financial benefit, each of the creditors may demand that the said act be declared ineffective with respect to it, if the debtor
acted knowingly to the creditors’ detriment, and the third party knew or, having used due care, could have learned of it.
This provision applies accordingly if the debtor acts with an intention to harm future creditors. It is assumed that the
debtor’s legal act is performed to the creditors’ detriment if, as a result of such act, the debtor becomes insolvent or becomes
insolvent to a greater degree than he was before performing the act (as described in Supreme Court judgements Case No.
II CSK 548/11, Case No. III CSK 143/16, Case No. III CSK 214/11). The application to the court with respect to “actio
_Pauliana” can be filed within five years from the date of the act._

Furthermore, the Polish Civil Code stipulates that if a contract is executed whose performance renders the satisfaction of a
third party claim partly or wholly impossible, that party may demand that the contract be declared ineffective with respect
to it if the parties to the contract knew of the claim or if the contract was free of charge.

**_Limitations resulting from the Polish Commercial Code_**

The Notes and the Guarantees and the grant of Collateral by the Polish Guarantor is also subject to certain provisions of
the Polish Commercial Companies Code (Polish: Kodeks Spółek Handlowych) of September 15, 2000 (consolidated text:
Journal of Laws of 2022, item 1467, as amended) (the “Polish Commercial Companies Code”). With respect to the
limited liability company (Polish: spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, sp. z o.o.) pursuant to the Polish Commercial
Companies Code, the creation of a limited right in rem over the enterprise or over its organized part requires a resolution
of the shareholders under the pain of invalidity.

Pursuant to Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the shareholders may not receive, under any title,
any payments from the Polish limited liability company’s assets needed to fully cover the share capital of this company. A
breach of this rule results in the shareholders’ obligation to return the payments up to the amount of the share capital.
Therefore, the liability of any Guarantor incorporated under Polish law on account of payments under the up-stream
Guarantees should be limited by the Polish capital maintenance rules i.e., so that it would not result in a payment being
made in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code.

If a share pledge is enforced and the shareholder changes, a new “relation of domination” might arise. In such case the new
shareholder would be obliged to notify the dependent company, i.e., the Polish Guarantor, of this fact. Otherwise, its right
to vote from its shares representing more than 33% of the share capital of the dependent company will be suspended. A
new relation of domination might also arise if under a pledge agreement, the pledgee gains a majority of the votes at the
general meeting of the Polish Guarantor. The corresponding notification duty has to be fulfilled by the pledgee.

**_Interests limitation_**

Pursuant to Article 359 of the Act of April 23, 1964 Civil Code (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2023, item 1610 as
amended) (the “Civil Code”), the maximum interest resulting from the legal act, i.e., so called “capital interest” (Polish:
_odsetki kapitałowe) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest (i.e., double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate_
published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 3.5 percentage points).

In addition, according to the Article 481 of the Civil Code, the maximum interest resulting from a delay (Polish: odsetki za
_opóźnienie) cannot per annum exceed double statutory interest for delay (i.e., double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate_
published by the National Bank of Poland and (ii) 5.5 percentage points).

Should the value of interest exceed the value of relevant maximum interest, then relevant maximum interest is due.
Contractual provisions cannot exclude or limit the provisions on maximum interest. The above-mentioned specific
provision of Polish law shall be applied by a Polish court irrespective of the fact that the parties have chosen foreign law
to govern the transaction (overriding mandatory provisions).

**_Clearance from the President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers in order to execute_**
**_some rights over shares_**

An exercise of voting rights in the Polish Guarantor by the holder of the relevant security under a power of attorney may
be recognized as a change of control pursuant to the Act on Protection of Competition and Consumers of February 16,
2007 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2023, item 1689, as amended) (the “Competition Law”), if certain statutory
conditions regarding the requirement to notify the concentration (in particular, related to the turnover generated by the
parties), indicated in the art. 13 of the Competition Law, are met. However, art. 14 of the Competition Law provides with
exceptions, when the clearance from the President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers (the
“President of UOKiK”), is not required. Among others, the notification is not required, when an entity acquires or takes
up, on a temporary basis, stocks and shares with a view to securing debts, provided, that such entity does not exercise the
rights arising from these stocks or shares, except for the right to sell.

Thus, the holder of such security may be obliged to notify the President of UOKiK about its intention to exercise its voting
rights and to obtain prior antimonopoly clearance to exercise such voting rights. The enforcement of a pledge through the
appropriation of the shares by the Security Agent may be recognized as a notifiable merger under the Competition Law.
Therefore, the holder of the relevant security interest may be required to notify the President of UOKIK about the intended
concentration and obtain relevant antimonopoly clearance to take over the shares.

**_Decision of the President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers to take action to sell_**
**_shares or stocks_**

As a result of the amendments to the regulations of May 20, 2023, the aim of which is to extend the liability for competitionrestricting practices, in the event that a given entrepreneur commits unlawful anti-competitive practices, an entrepreneur
exercising decisive influence may also be deemed to be in breach, whereby an entrepreneur is presumed to exercise decisive


-----

influence if its share in the capital of another entrepreneur exceeds 90%. In such a situation, the President of UOKIK may,
in a decision on recognizing a practice as restrictive of competition, order to undertake actions consisting in the sale of
shares or stocks ensuring control over the entrepreneur or entrepreneurs.

**_Perfection requirements_**

Generally, under Polish law, for a valid and effective establishment of security interests certain perfection requirements
need to be fulfilled, including the requirements specified below.

The registered civil (ordinary) and financial pledges over the shares in the Polish Guarantor may be validly established
only after fulfillment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper registered pledge
agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register of pledges maintained by the competent
court and will become effective vis à vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such pledge; (ii)
the proper civil (ordinary) pledge agreement must be executed with the signatures certified by a Polish notary and will
become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such pledge; (iii) the proper
financial pledge agreement must be executed and will become effective vis-à-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified
of the establishment of such pledge, (iv) the pledges should be disclosed in the book of shares of the Polish Guarantor.
Additional formal requirements are to be complied with.

The registered civil (ordinary) and financial pledges over the bank accounts the Polish Guarantor may be validly established
only after fulfilment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper registered pledge
agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register of pledges maintained by the competent
court; (ii) the proper civil (ordinary) pledge agreement must be executed with a certified date (i.e., a date certified by a
Polish notary); (iii) the proper financial pledge agreement must be executed; (iv) the bank maintaining the bank account
needs to be notified by the pledgor about the establishment of the civil (ordinary) and financial pledge; and (v) a financial
pledge over the funds in a bank account should be noted in the relevant bank account that is the subject of the security. The
agreement of the security assignment or transfer of ownership of a thing, receivable or of other right (even if governed by
non-Polish law) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate (as defined by the Bankruptcy Law) of the assignor, if it was
executed in writing with a certified date (i.e., a date certified by a Polish notary).

In principle, a secured creditor can enforce its security once the secured claim becomes mature, in whole or in part (that is,
the debt becomes due and payable). Under certain circumstances, the creditor must obtain a final and non-appealable court
decision and enforcement clause before enforcing its security. A less formal procedure is possible, for example, if the claim
is secured by registered or financial pledge and the pledge agreement provides that the creditor can take over the pledge
object.

**_Parallel debt structure under Polish law_**

In majority of cases, under Polish law security interests cannot be granted to a party other than the creditor of the secured
claim. Generally, under Polish law, the pledge or mortgage is strictly accessory and follows the debt or claim it secures
and may not be transferred without such debt or claim. If such debt or claim is transferred without the pledge or mortgage,
the pledge or mortgage will expire.

For that reason, in certain transactions, also in Poland, a parallel debt structure is used, whereby the guarantor, as a separate
and independent obligation governed by non-Polish law, undertakes to pay to the security agent amounts equal to the
amounts due by it to all creditors in a given transaction. Such parallel debt structure, therefore, creates a single separate
and independent claim of the security agent that can be validly secured by a security interest. Consequently, the security
interests are granted to the security agent in its own capacity as a creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel
debt, and not as a representative of the creditors. It is usually expressly agreed in such parallel debt agreement that the
obligations of the debtor towards the security agent shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal
obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa).

The Supreme Court issued the judgments on October 9, 2009 (Case No. IV CSK 145/09, Case No. IV CSK 169/09 and
Case No. IV CSK 155/09) concerning the effectiveness of establishing security interests over the assets of the debtor of
parallel debt. In the above cases, the Supreme Court has not challenged the validity of a foreign law parallel debt structure,
however, such structure was only indirectly referred to in the above judgments. As there is no doctrine of “precedence”
under Polish law, uncertainty exists as to validity and enforceability of the parallel debt under Polish law.

As Polish law does not recognize the concept of “trust” or “trustee”, it is uncertain how the Security Agent will be treated
by a Polish court.


-----

**CZECH REPUBLIC**

One of the Guarantors is a private limited liability company (společnost s ručením omezeným) incorporated under the laws
of the Czech Republic (the “Czech Guarantor”). Consequently, in the event of insolvency of the Czech Guarantor,
insolvency proceedings may be initiated in the Czech Republic, and would then be governed by Czech Insolvency laws.

In principle, insolvency proceedings with respect to a Czech company should be based on the Czech insolvency laws.
Nevertheless, under the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a Czech company conducts business in another Member State
of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the Czech courts may be limited if the company’s “centre of main interests” is
found to be in a Member State other than the Czech Republic.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Under the Act No. 182/2006 Coll., the Insolvency Act, as amended (the “Czech Insolvency Act”), insolvency proceedings
can be initiated either by the debtor (Czech Guarantor) or by any of its creditors in the event of the insolvency (úpadek) in
the form of the over-indebtedness (předlužení) of the debtor or inability to meet the debtor’s obligations (platební
_neschopnost). The debtor is in “payment insolvency” if all of the following assumptions are fulfilled: the debtor (i) has_
more than one creditor; (ii) has unpaid debts which are overdue for more than 30 days ; and (iii) is unable to pay these
debts. A debtor is deemed unable to pay its monetary obligations if (i) it has suspended payments of a substantial portion
of its monetary obligations, (ii) it is in default with payment of its monetary obligations for more than three months
following their maturity, (iii) it is not possible to satisfy some of the due receivables against the debtor by means of a court
enforcement of decisions (výkon rozhodnutí) or distraint (exekuce), or (iv) the debtor fails to submit to the relevant Czech
court solving the debtor’s insolvency requested lists of its assets, obligations and employees or documents evidencing the
insolvency or imminent insolvency (hrozící úpadek) (in cases where such lists shall be submitted by the debtor to the
insolvency court pursuant to the Czech Insolvency Act). However, the debtor who is an entrepreneur and keeps accounting
books is deemed able to fulfill its monetary obligations if (i) the difference between its due and payable monetary
obligations and its disposable resources (the “gap coverage”) as stated in the report on its cash position amounts to less
than one tenth of its due and payable monetary obligations or if (ii) the report on development of its cash projection
evidences that the gap coverage will descend below one tenth of its due and payable monetary obligations during the period
of that projection. Both reports are to be prepared by an auditor, expert or other certified consultant in line with the
requirements by applicable laws.

A debtor is over-indebted if it has at least two creditors and its total liabilities exceed the value of its assets (taking into
account further administration of the debtor’s assets and/or further operation of its business if it is likely that the debtor
will be able to further administer its assets and/or conduct its business). However, since there is no clear guidance as how
to calculate the value of a debtor’s assets, in some cases it may be rather difficult to determine whether the debtor meets
the over-indebtedness criterion and the views of the debtor and its creditors may vary in this regard.

In addition, the debtor may also file an insolvency petition in case of imminent insolvency (hrozící úpadek), i.e., if it may
be reasonably expected with regard to all circumstances that the debtor will not be able to perform a substantial part of its
monetary obligations duly and on time.

Insolvency proceedings are commenced upon the entitled person filing the insolvency petition (insolvenční návrh) to the
relevant insolvency court, which is then published by the court in the publicly available insolvency register. The effects of
the commencement of insolvency proceedings are only invoked upon the publication of the notice of the commencement
of insolvency proceedings in the insolvency register. The insolvency petition can be filed by the debtor or any creditor of
the debtor. The debtor, as well as each of its statutory proxies, directors and liquidators, is under the statutory obligation to
file an insolvency petition without undue delay after it has learned or should have learned, acting diligently, of the debtor’s
insolvency The insolvency court is allowed to postpone the publication of the insolvency petition immediately after its
filing if it has been filed by debtor’s creditor and the court doubts reasonably the legitimacy of such petition until the final
decision about its legitimacy has become effective. The most substantial effects of the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings in respect of a debtor are the following:

- the debtor’s creditors may not seek their claims or other rights concerning the insolvency estate by a legal action
(žaloba) if they can lodge their claims in the insolvency proceedings by means of a lodgment of claims (přihláška
pohledávky);

- a security interest relating to the assets owned by the debtor or other assets belonging to the insolvency estate may
be created or realized (uplatnit) only pursuant to the statutory conditions of the Czech Insolvency Act;

- court enforcement of decisions or distrait that would affect the assets owned by the debtor or other assets belonging
to the insolvency estate may be ordered, but may not be generally performed; and


-----

- the debtor is generally prohibited from making disposals of the insolvency estate and assets which may belong to
it if it might substantially change the structure, use or determination of such assets or which might cause a
non-negligible reduction of such assets.

The relevant insolvency court is entitled to order protective measures to secure the property of the debtor before it issues
its decision on the debtor’s insolvency.

Furthermore, no later than within seven days (in case of an insolvency petition filed by the debtor) after the filing of the
insolvency petition or within 15 days (in case of an insolvency petition filed by the debtor’s creditor) after the delivery of
the insolvency petition by the insolvency court, the debtor may file a petition for a moratorium with the insolvency court
unless the debtor is being liquidated. However, the written consent of the majority of its creditors (counted on the basis of
the amount of claims of the respective creditors) and the latest financial statements of the debtor must be attached to such
a petition for a moratorium. The court may declare a moratorium of up to three months. The duration of the moratorium
may be further prolonged by the court upon the debtor’s request with the updated list of obligations and with the written
consent of the majority of its creditors (counted on the basis of the amount of claims of the respective creditors) for another
30 days.

Depending on the method of resolution of the debtor’s insolvency, the creditors who have submitted their claim in the
insolvency proceedings have different rights and possibilities to influence the insolvency proceedings. This is effectuated
via the creditors’ bodies:

- the assembly of creditors (schůze věřitelů); and

- the committee of creditors (věřitelský výbor) or representative of creditors (zástupce věřitelů).

The assembly of creditors comprises all creditors who have submitted their claims in the insolvency proceedings. The
competence of the assembly of creditors includes, among other things, replacement of the court-appointed insolvency
administrator with an insolvency administrator appointed by the assembly of creditors, election of the committee of
creditors (representative of creditors) and decision on the method of resolution of the debtor’s insolvency. Furthermore,
the assembly of creditors may in principle reserve for itself any matter that falls within the competence of the creditors’
bodies. Those creditors who are persons related to the debtor (osoba blízká) or persons belonging to the same group of
companies (koncern) as the debtor are not allowed to vote at the meeting of the assembly of creditors (besides few
exceptions stated in the Czech Insolvency Act).

The committee of creditors supervises the activity of the insolvency administrator, grants its consent to the conclusion of
debtor-in-possession financing agreements (úvěrové financování) to the debtor or the insolvency administrator (as
applicable), is entitled to make proposals to the insolvency court relating to the course of the insolvency proceedings, etc.
The committee of creditors comprises at least 3 and at most 7 members; the number depends on the resolution of the
assembly of creditors. In the event that not more than 50 creditors have lodged their claims in the insolvency proceedings
or if the method of resolving the insolvency is negligible bankruptcy (nepatrný konkurs), the assembly of creditors is not
obligated to elect the committee of creditors and may instead elect a representative of creditors and his/her substitute. If
the number of members of the committee of creditors falls below 3 or below the majority, the scope of the committee of
creditors is exercised by the insolvency court itself until the confirmation of the new election or the additional election of
the members of the committee of creditors.

The Czech Insolvency Act provides for different priorities of claims. Generally, the claims lodged in the insolvency
proceedings are subject to formal review process conducted in front of the insolvency court (přezkumné jednání) where
each of the insolvency administrator, the debtor and other creditors who have lodged their claims may challenge the
existence (validity) or the amount of a claim registered by a creditor as well the existence (validity) of the security interest
securing the claim. Should the claim be challenged, an incidental dispute within the insolvency proceedings is commenced
that will be decided by the insolvency court. If the challenge is successful, the claim, the amount thereof or the security
interest will not be ascertained in the insolvency proceedings. Moreover, that creditor may face severe monetary penalties
as set forth by the Czech Insolvency Act.

The insolvency court is obliged to take steps leading to the decision on the insolvency of the debtor within 10 days after
the filing of the insolvency petition. In case of the insolvency petition submitted by the debtor, the insolvency court is
obliged to decide on the petition 15 days after the submission thereof at the latest; if the moratorium is declared, such period
will not end before expiry of 10 days after the extinction of the moratorium. If the debtor’s insolvency or imminent
insolvency is evidenced or proven in the insolvency proceedings, the court shall issue a decision declaring the debtor’s
insolvency. In this decision, the court, among other things, (i) appoints an insolvency administrator (insolvenční správce)
which is to dispose of the debtor’s assets to the extent to which the debtor is prohibited from doing so, (ii) requests the
creditors which have not yet lodged their claims to do so within a time period of 2 months and (iii) request the debtor to


-----

file a list of his estate and all his debtors and creditors. The court however may not issue a decision declaring the debtor’s
insolvency during the moratorium.

Should the insolvency petition be filed by a creditor, then such a creditor (besides few exceptions stated in the Czech
Insolvency Act) is obliged to pay the deposit covering costs of insolvency proceedings in amount of CZK50,000.00 (in
case of the debtor being a legal person – entrepreneur) or CZK10,000.00 (in all other cases). As an expression of the
electronisation process of the insolvency proceedings the petition must be filed by electronic means. Also the
communication towards the majority of parties in the insolvency proceeding, is made generally only by a public notice
made by the insolvency court published in the online insolvency register.

Furthermore, the creditor filing the insolvency petition has to prove that he has a due and payable claim against the debtor,
and has to attach to the petition an application for registration of the claim. If the petitioner is a legal entity that keeps books
of accounts or tax records, it is in principle obliged to substantiate the claim by means of the debtor’s acknowledgment of
debt with authenticated signature, or by means of an enforceable judgment, or a notarial deed with an enforceability consent
clause, or an enforcement officer’s deed with an enforceability consent clause, or a confirmation by an auditor, courtappointed expert or tax adviser to the effect that the claim is reflected in the petitioner’s accounting books.

The insolvency court might order on the ground of a motion submitted by another participant of the insolvency proceeding
or by the insolvency administrator that the creditors who are foreign legal entities or foreigners with their usual residence
abroad are obliged to deposit a security (jistota) to cover costs of the insolvency proceedings or to compensate damages
emerging from their participation in the insolvency proceedings to other participants. Provided these creditors fail to obey
the order, their lodgment of claims shall not be taken into account. However, this rule does not apply on those creditors
(i) who are citizens or foreign legal entities from a Member State of the European Union or from another state of European
Economic Area, or (ii) who own a real estate in the Czech Republic with the sufficient value to ensure the aim of a security
or (iii) whose home country does not require such security from Czech nationals.

Depending on the facts of the case, the insolvency court should adopt a decision on the method of resolution of the debtor’s
insolvency either along with the decision on the debtor’s insolvency or no later than three months after the issuance of the
decision on the debtor’s insolvency. The Czech Insolvency Act provides for two methods of resolution of a debtor’s
insolvency applicable to entrepreneurs, namely bankruptcy liquidation (konkurs) and reorganization (reorganizace).

**_Bankruptcy liquidation_**

In principle, bankruptcy liquidation procedure is a method of resolution of a debtor’s insolvency in which the insolvency
estate is liquidated and the claims of the creditors are generally satisfied proportionately from the proceeds of such
liquidation. Accordingly, upon the declaration of bankruptcy liquidation, the right to dispose with the insolvency estate
and thus the management of the debtor’s enterprise is conveyed to the insolvency administrator.

A declaration of bankruptcy liquidation renders ineffective (i) all easements created in favor of creditors under strikingly
disadvantageous conditions after the effects of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings occurred and (ii) security
interests relating to the assets belonging to the insolvency estate created after the effects of the commencement of the
insolvency proceedings occurred unless created in accordance with the strict conditions of the Czech Insolvency Act.
Furthermore, executory contracts entered into by the debtor and requiring mutual performance which have not been fully
performed by both the debtor and the other party to the contract (smlouvy o vzájemném plnění) may be generally either
assumed or rescinded by the insolvency administrator.

Claims against the insolvency estate (e.g. for remuneration and reimbursement of costs of the insolvency administrator, the
members of the committee of creditors and the finance office regarding tax deduction correction) and certain other claims
(e.g. employment-related claims of the debtor’s employees) are satisfied preferentially in their full amount at any time after
the insolvency court passes a decision declaring the debtor’s insolvency. In addition to that, creditors whose claims are
secured (zajištění věřitelé) are separately satisfied in their respective rank from the achieved proceeds of sale of the asset
(after deduction of the remuneration of the insolvency administrator and costs of the administration and sale, but in principle
not more than 9% from the proceeds of sale of the asset) on which the security was established and are entitled to make
instructions to the insolvency administrator to the course of its realization and administration. However, should a housing
unit be sold during liquidation of the insolvency estate and should a person responsible for administration of the concerned
house lodge a claim relating to such administration, then such a claim is to be satisfied prior to satisfaction of secured
creditors’ claims (up to a maximum of one tenth of the sale proceeds). Claims of unsecured creditors are satisfied pari
passu from the proceeds of liquidation of the insolvency estate on the basis of the distribution resolution (rozvrhové
_usnesení) issued by the insolvency court. Subordinated claims and claims of debtor’s shareholders arising as a result of_
their participation in the company may only be satisfied if all of the claims to which the insolvency proceedings relate have
already been satisfied in full.


-----

As a general rule, claims or parts thereof which were not satisfied in the insolvency proceedings do not cease to exist after
the termination of the insolvency proceedings. However, the bankruptcy procedure in principle leads to the dissolution of
the debtor as a legal entity, and thus the unsatisfied claims or their parts cease to exist as result of the dissolution of the
legal entity.

**_Reorganization_**

In the reorganization procedure, the creditors’ claims are satisfied gradually as the debtor further operates its enterprise
whereas measures aiming at rescue of the debtor’s business are taken pursuant to the reorganization plan (reorganizační
_plán) approved by the insolvency court. As a principle, upon the court’s decision approving the reorganization becoming_
final and binding, the restrictions on the debtor’s right to dispose with its assets expire. However, the debtor is entitled to
enter into legal acts with substantial impact on the insolvency estate only with the consent of the committee of creditors.

However, the reorganization procedure is only available if all of the below mentioned conditions are satisfied:

(a) the debtor is an entrepreneur (which is met in case of the Czech Guarantor);

(b) the debtor is not a legal entity in liquidation, a securities trader, or an entity entitled to trade on the commodity
exchange; and

(c) the debtor’s annual total net turnover for the last accounting period preceding the filing of the insolvency petition
reached at least the amount of CZK50,000,000 or the debtor employs at least 50 employees in an employment relationship
(pracovní poměr).

The condition under letter (c) does not apply if the debtor, no later than the date on which the court issued a decision
declaring the debtor’s insolvency, submits a reorganization plan accepted by at least half of the creditors whose claims are
secured (zajištění věřitelé) and at least half of all unsecured creditors (nezajištění věřitelé) (in both cases counted on the
basis of the amount of claims of the respective creditors). If the insolvency petition is filed by the debtor’s creditor and the
debtor submits the respective request to the insolvency court before the declaration of insolvency, the debtor may, however,
submit a reorganization plan accepted by its secured and unsecured creditors as stated above within the period of up to
additional thirty days following the declaration of the debtor’s insolvency. The insolvency court cannot, however, order
reorganization if the assembly of creditors opts for bankruptcy liquidation pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Czech
Insolvency Act. Moreover, in order to finally order the reorganization plan, statutory conditions relating to the approval
thereof must be fulfilled.

**_Hardening Periods and Voidable Transactions_**

In the event that insolvency proceedings with respect to the Czech Guarantor were governed by Czech law, certain
transactions by the Czech Guarantor, including the provision of the Guarantee, could be potentially challenged by an
insolvency administrator by means of a legal action (žaloba) under the rules relating to voidable transactions as set out in
the Czech Insolvency Act if concluded or performed during the “hardening periods”.

Generally, the insolvency administrator may challenge legal acts by means of which the debtor curtails the satisfaction of
its creditors or by means of which the debtor favors certain creditors over the others (whereas the term legal act also covers
omissions). In particular, the insolvency administrator may challenge the effectiveness (účinnost) of the following legal
acts of the debtor against the insolvency administrator, the creditors and the insolvency estate:

(a) legal acts without reasonable consideration, _i.e., legal acts under which the debtor undertook to provide_
performance for no consideration or for consideration with a usual value substantially lower than the usual value
of the debtor’s performance, if they were undertaken during the debtor’s insolvency or which rendered the debtor
insolvent (whereas in case of legal acts in favor of a person related to the debtor (osoba blízká) or a person
belonging to the same group of companies (koncern) as the debtor it is up to such person to provide evidence that
the legal acts were not undertaken during the debtor’s insolvency);

(b) preferential legal acts, i.e., legal acts as a result of which a creditor receives a higher satisfaction than it would
receive in the bankruptcy liquidation procedure to the detriment of other creditors, in case they were undertaken
during the debtor’s insolvency or which rendered the debtor insolvent (whereas in case of legal acts in favor of a
person related to the debtor or a person belonging to the same group of companies as the debtor it is up to such
person to provide evidence that the legal acts were not undertaken during the debtor’s insolvency), whereas such
preferential legal acts may, in particular, include legal acts:

    - by which the debtor paid its debt before it became due;


-----

    - under which the debtor agreed upon a modification or replacement of its obligation, to its own detriment;

    - under which the debtor waived the performance of its receivable towards another debtor or otherwise
agreed upon or enabled the cessation or the non- performance of its right; and

    - under which the debtor provided its assets to secure an already existing obligation (unless the security
interest is established as a result of changes in the internal content of a pledged compound thing).

(c) intentionally fraudulent legal acts, i.e., legal acts by which the debtor intentionally curtails the satisfaction of a
creditor provided that the other party to the legal act knew or with regard to all circumstances must have known
about such debtor’s intention (whereas in case of legal acts in favor of a person related to the debtor or a person
belonging to the same group of companies as the debtor it is up to such person to provide evidence that the person
did not know about the debtor’s intention).

The insolvency administrator may, in one year period commencing from the legal effects of the court’s decision on the
debtor’s insolvency, challenge the effectiveness of the legal acts without reasonable consideration and preferential legal
acts which were taken during (i) the last three years prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings if they were
undertaken to the benefit of a person related to the debtor or a person belonging to the same group of companies as the
debtor, or (ii) in the last year preceding the commencement of the insolvency proceedings in all other cases. The
effectiveness of the intentionally fraudulent legal acts may be challenged if they were undertaken during the last five years
prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings. In general, the Czech Insolvency Act shifts the burden of proof
in respect to certain matters on the insolvent debtor’s counterparty and extends the clawback periods in case of legal acts
made in favor of connected persons.

In the event that the insolvency administrator successfully challenges the effectiveness of a legal act undertaken by the
debtor, the persons to the benefit of which such ineffective legal act was undertaken or which benefited from the ineffective
legal act are obligated to give up the performance from such legal act to the benefit of the insolvency estate.

**_Preventive Restructuring_**

As to September 23, 2023, the new Act no. 284/2023 Coll, on Preventive Restructuring (the “Czech Preventive
**Restructuring Act”), which is an implementation of the Preventive Restructuring Directive, became effective. The**
primary purpose of a preventive restructuring is to help managers and shareholders of companies at risk of insolvency and
to solve a financial crisis by agreement with the creditors (especially those creditors that are critical for further operation
of the business) before the insolvency (or even imminent insolvency) occurs. It is based on a mitigation plan (sanační
_projekt) that is later to be transformed into a more detailed restructuring plan (restrukturalizační plán) containing the_
restructuring measures for business operation or restoration (i.e., restructuring of debtor’s assets, restructuring of debtor’s
liabilities, restructuring of the equity capital and operational changes) to avoid the insolvency or imminent insolvency.
Access to preventive restructuring is limited to business corporations that meet especially the following fundamental
conditions: (i) the corporation should be in good faith regarding the keeping or restoration of its business; (ii) the
corporation is not unable to meet its monetary obligations (platební neschopnost); but (iii) its financial difficulties are so
serious that if the proposed restructuring measures are not implemented, the corporation would become insolvent, and (iv)
the corporation does not pursue a dishonest intent. Compared to insolvency proceedings, preventive restructuring does not
have to involve all the existing creditors of the company, but the key creditors only (usually the banks and the suppliers of
key components or energy sources) - the claims of the unaffected parties can be set aside as unaffected if satisfied within
the due dates in full. The Czech Preventive Restructuring Act further provides for special protection of new and interim
financing (such as protection against claw-back actions in case of future potential insolvency). The main difference of the
preventive restructuring proceedings from the insolvency proceedings is a limited publicity and limited involvement of the
court. Also, the corporation intended to use the preventive restructuring is entitled to use a protection against enforcement
of actions of secured and unsecured creditors and against discontinuation of key contracts in the form of general (against
all creditors) or individual (against any particular creditor) moratorium. In the Czech Republic, the proceedings under the
Czech Preventive Restructuring Act are initiated through a written debtor’s call to affected parties (creditors and
shareholders) for initiation of the negotiations on the restructuring plan; the mitigation plan is attached thereto. The effects
of the commencement of preventive restructurisation are invoked upon the delivery of the call for the negotiations on the
restructuring plan to the first party. The initiation of the restructuring proceeding is further noticed to the competent
restructuring court.

The main core of the preventive restructuring is taken pursuant to the restructuring plan set by the debtor deviding the
affected parties into particular groups, each with the particular legal position within the preventive restructuring proceeding
(similar to the reorganization plan – see above “Reorganization”). The restructuring plan can use some restructuring
measures (see above) that may negatively impact the affected parties, in particular the measures in form of the changes of
interest rates, change of the payment conditions, or change of the collaterals granted by the debtor (including provision of
the Guarantee by the Czech Guarantor) through the adjustments of way of security, change of ranking, change of way of


-----

satisfaction from such collateral, or even through the release. The restructuring plan will be adopted if accepted all the
affected persons’ groups whereas the three-quarters majority of votes is necessary for acception within each group;
nevertheless, the voting can be replaced by entry into an agreement on acceptance of the restructuring plan in the form of
the notarial deed. If some of the group do not adopt the restructuring plan (e.g. because of disapproval to the rate of debtor’s
exemption from the debts or to the deferred maturity of such debts), the adoption of such group can be replaced by the
decision of the restructuring court. Approval by the restructuring court is also required if the restructuring plan involves
the provision of the new financing or decrease in amount of employees by at least one-quarter.

The preventive restructuring proceeding is being terminated in particular by the fulfilment of the restructuring plan, but
also by the decision of the restructuring court on the unconfirmation of the restructuring plan or further cancellation of the
restructuring plan, or by the decision on the insolvency of the debtor within the insolvency proceeding.

**_Limitation on Enforcement of the Guarantee_**

In order to ensure that the Czech Guarantor does not violate the Czech rules on financial assistance pursuant to Act
No. 90/2012 Coll., as amended (the “Czech Act on Business Corporations”) or certain insolvency limitations by
providing a guarantee, it is standard practice for indentures, credit agreements and guarantees to contain “limitation
language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in the Czech Republic.

Accordingly, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Czech Guarantor subject to certain exceptions including those which if
incurred, directly or indirectly, would result in the violation of financial assistance rules arising from Section 41 and 200
of the Czech Act on Business Corporations.

Furthermore, the guarantees provided by the Czech Guarantor may be subject to additional limitations limiting the amount
of guaranteed obligations to the extent that is economically and operationally justifiable for a Czech Guarantor. Such
limitation may, without limitation to, mitigate a risk of assessment of the guarantee by the insolvency administrator as a
favoring legal act.

For completeness, upon the commencement of insolvency proceedings in respect of the Czech Guarantor, creditors from
the Guarantee will not be able to seek the direct enforcement of the obligations of the Czech Guarantor arising under the
Guarantee and will need to submit their claim in such insolvency proceedings initiated in respect of the Czech Guarantor.

**_Enforcement of security and Guarantees_**

Under Czech law, a security interest is not enforceable for the benefit of a beneficiary who is not a party to the relevant
security agreement creating such security interest. As a result, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of
parallel debt obligations for the purpose of Czech security interests securing the Notes and the Guarantees. Pursuant to
these parallel debt obligations, the security interests will be structured such that the Security Agent will become an
independent and separate creditor, acting on behalf of itself and the holders of the Notes in respect of each and every
obligation owing and incurred by the Issuer under the Notes and the relevant security documents. The parallel debt
obligations procedure is, however, generally untested before the Czech courts, and we cannot assure you that it will be
recognized in accordance with its terms by the Czech courts.

**_Prohibition of provision of gratuitous performance to shareholders or related persons_**

Under Czech law a Czech company may not provide gratuitous performance to its shareholders or a person close to such
shareholders (including a person directly or indirectly controlling the Czech company). Czech law does not expressly
stipulate whether such prohibition applies also to provision of security interests for debts of Czech company’s shareholders
or persons close to them and whether a breach of such prohibition could cause such security interests or guarantees to be
invalid.

In order to mitigate the risk that the provision of the Guarantees and the Collateral by the Czech Guarantor will result in a
breach of the prohibition of gratuitous performance the relevant corporate approvals of the Czech Guarantor approving
such provision by the Czech Guarantor will contain a representation that the Czech Guarantor will benefit (monetarily or
not) from such provision of the Guarantees and the collateral by the Czech Guarantor.

**_Limitation language in the security documents to be provided by the Czech Guarantor_**

In order to mitigate certain risks, including that the Czech Guarantor breach some of the Czech financial assistance rules,
and/or become insolvent as a result of performing under a guarantee, indemnity and/or enforcement of security interests, it
is a standard practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents provided by Czech companies
to contain a limitation language.


-----

The obligations and liabilities of the Czech Guarantor under the Guarantee and/or indemnity provided in respect of the
Notes may not exceed a maximum cap calculated by reference to the book value of all assets of a Czech Guarantor so as
to mitigate the risk that the Czech Guarantor becomes insolvent by being over indebted as a result of payment under the
Guarantee. While this cap should generally protect the Czech Guarantor from insolvency resulting from its over
indebtedness (i.e., balance sheet insolvency), it cannot fully protect the Czech Guarantor from insolvency resulting from a
lack of liquidity in the event that the Guarantee is enforced and the Czech Guarantor is unable to fulfill its obligations under
the Guarantee in accordance with its terms.

**_Perfection of security interests_**

In general, Czech security interests become perfected by registration in public or similar registries (e.g., Land Registry in
respect of the real estate mortgage, Register of Pledges in respect of the moveable assets pledge and the Commercial
Register in respect of pledge over shares in limited liability companies) or execution of a pledge agreement over receivables
(if not concluded in form of a notarial deed). However, the pledge over receivables becomes effective against the debtor
owing the receivables (the sub debtor) once the sub debtor is notified of the pledge in accordance with the security
agreement or when the existence of the pledge is proved to the sub debtor by the pledgee.

**UNITED KINGDOM**

Progroup Board Ltd. (the "English Guarantor") is incorporated in England and Wales and its registered office is also
located in England and Wales. Therefore any insolvency proceedings in respect of the English Guarantor are likely to be
commenced in England and Wales and conducted in accordance with the requirements of English insolvency laws in force
at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. The scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the
different insolvency (and restructuring) proceedings available in England and Wales, further detail is set out below. To the
extent that the English Guarantor has any assets and/or creditors in any overseas jurisdictions and enters into insolvency
proceedings in England, recognition of those proceedings in such other jurisdictions is likely to be a relevant consideration.
Such recognition would be a matter for the private international law of the relevant jurisdictions.

Insolvency proceedings in relation to the English Guarantor could also be opened in a country other than England and
Wales in circumstances dictated by the domestic local rules of the jurisdiction in which those insolvency proceedings were
to be commenced. By way of example, where a debtor has its “center of main interests” (as defined in Regulation (EU)
2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings) in a member state
of the EU (other than Denmark), then (and subject to certain exceptions), insolvency proceedings in relation to that debtor
could be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state.

If insolvency proceedings were to be opened in a place other than England and Wales, such proceedings could be in parallel
to proceedings opened in England. Such foreign proceedings may be recognized in England, albeit such recognition would
not be automatic. For instance, there may be recognition in England pursuant to the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations
2006 (the "CBIR"), which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency in Great Britain (i.e.,
England, Wales and Scotland). The CBIR provide that foreign insolvency proceedings may be recognized in England
where a company has its center of main interest (as that concept is used in the CBIR) or an “establishment” (being a place
of operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such
foreign jurisdiction. Such recognition under the CBIR would be accompanied (depending upon the circumstances) by a
stay and a suspension of the right to transfer, encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company (neither of which
will affect a creditor's right to enforce security interests over the Collateral (albeit such a stay may be requested from the
English court) or to set off its claim against a claim of the company, provided that such right would have been exercisable
if the company had been made the subject of a winding-up order under the UK Insolvency Act (defined below)). Upon
recognition of a foreign proceeding, where necessary to protect the assets of the company or the interests of creditors the
court may, at the request of the foreign representative, grant any appropriate relief. This may include, without limitation,
staying the commencement or continuation of individual actions or individual proceedings concerning the company’s
assets, rights, obligations or liabilities, staying execution against the company’s assets, suspending the right to transfer,
encumber or otherwise dispose of any assets of the company, providing for the examination of witnesses, the taking of
evidence or the delivery of information concerning the company’s assets, affairs, rights, obligations or liabilities entrusting
the administration or realization of all or part of the company’s assets located in Great Britain to the foreign representative
or another person designated by the court, extending relief of a provisional nature previously granted and the granting of
any additional relief that may be available to a British insolvency officeholder under the laws of Great Britain, including
any relief provided under paragraph 43 of Schedule B1 to the UK Insolvency Act (defined below).

It is therefore not possible to say with certainty where insolvency proceedings will be brought.

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be
familiar. In the event that the English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty
the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes are guaranteed by the English Guarantor


-----

and secured by security interests over the Collateral created by, among others, the English Guarantor. English insolvency
laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a Guarantee against the English Guarantor and the enforceability
of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the
Guarantee and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their
ability to enforce their rights under the Guarantee and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees and therefore
may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of the English Guarantor.

**_The Insolvency Test_**

The Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the “UK Insolvency Act”) has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but
instead relies on the concept of a company’s ‘inability to pay its debts’ as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant
to Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act, a company will be deemed “unable to pay its debts” if it is proved to the court’s
satisfaction that the company is not able to pay its debts as they fall due (“cashflow” basis) or that the value of the
company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities)
(“balance sheet” basis). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, a statutory demand for over £750 is served
on the company and remains unsatisfied for three weeks after service of the statutory demand or the company has failed to
secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the relevant creditor within such period, or if any execution or
other process issued in respect of a court judgment in favor of a creditor is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England may be initiated in a number of ways and by different parties
depending on the process (see below for further detail on each process).

**_Applicable insolvency proceedings_**

For these purposes, the applicable insolvency regimes under English law are administration and liquidation.

The English legal regime (which is principally set out in the UK Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales)
Rules 2016 (together with the UK Insolvency Act, (the “UK Insolvency Legislation”)) that would apply in the event of
any insolvency proceedings of the English Guarantor may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions with which creditors may be more familiar.

For the Holders of the Notes, indirectly benefiting from the Guarantee and security interests granted by the English
Guarantor, the most important consequences of the opening of formal insolvency proceedings in England and Wales against
the English Guarantor would be that:

  - the appointed insolvency practitioner (an administrator or liquidator) would have the right to administer and
dispose of the assets of such English Guarantor as the representative of the insolvent estate;

  - in certain circumstances, an administrator or a liquidator will have powers to challenge the Guarantee and security
interests granted by the English Guarantor and potentially certain intercompany obligations entered into by the
English Guarantor; and

  - in general terms, the Holders of the Notes could only pursue their claims against the English Guarantor in
accordance with the provisions in the UK Insolvency Legislation.

**_Administration_**

Administration is a flexible procedure, the primary purpose of which is the rescue of the company as a going concern (the
other purposes are set out below). A company can enter into administration if the company is (i) registered under the
Companies Act 2006 (“CA06”) in England and Wales or Scotland, (ii) is incorporated in an EEA State; (iii) is not
incorporated in an EEA State but has its center of main interests (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act) (“COMI”) in an
EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the UK; (iv) has its center of main interests (as defined in Article 3 of
Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (as
it applies under English law) (“Retained European Insolvency Regulation”) (“Retained EIR COMI”) in an EU Member
State (other than Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK; or (v) it has its Retained EIR COMI in the UK. Without
limitation and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant
company is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve
the purpose of administration.

Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), the English Guarantor can be placed into administration by court
order on the application of, among others, the English Guarantor itself, a majority of its directors or one or more of its


-----

creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors) and, where applicable, the Financial Conduct Authority or the
Prudential Regulation authority or certain other designated persons.

If the English Guarantor grants a “qualifying floating charge” (as defined below) to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party has the right to appoint an administrator. On that basis, the holder of a qualifying floting charge
has the right to intervene in an application made by another person for an administration order with respect to the English
Guarantor by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the
appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver (see below). A qualifying floating charge is
defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the UK Insolvency Act as being a floating charge created by an instrument
which: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; and/or (ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge
to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the UK Insolvency Act and/or an
administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a qualifying floating charge if that person holds one or more
debentures of the company secured by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or
substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge.

Separately, an administrator can be appointed to the English Guarantor through an out-of-court appointment process. The
out-of-court method of appointment is available only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying
floating charge. No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment takes effect when the court
stamps receipt of the relevant forms. In the case of an out-of-court appointment being effected by directors or the company,
each holder of a qualifying floating charge is required to be provided with advance notice of the directors’ or company’s
intention to appoint an administrator or be notified that the company has filed for liquidation so that the holder of the
qualifying floating charge can then appoint its own administrator or administrative receiver.

Please note that carve-outs in the security document which apply to the floating charge may, on their own, or cumulatively
with other carve-outs, impact the analysis of whether the ‘whole or substantially the whole of the property’ is covered and
thereby whether the charge is a “qualifying floating charge” and the lender is able to appoint an administrator out-of-court.
There is further, the risk of re-characterization referred to below, which can occur in a variety of circumstances, including
in less obvious cases, for example, where the granting of security is subject to contractual consents, or where covenant lite
style disposal covenants may not restrict transfers of shares in subsidiaries.

Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, the administrator will need to consent to act as administrator and to state
that, in his or her opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be satisfied, which the administrator must attempt
to achieve in order: (i) the rescue of the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going
concern (the primary objective); (ii) if the primary objective is not reasonably practicable, the achievement of a better result
for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in
administration) (the second objective); or (iii) if neither the primary nor the secondary objective is reasonably practicable
and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unneccessirly harmed thereby, the realization of some or all of the
company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (the third objective). Subject to
this, the administrator must perform his or her functions in the interests of the company’s creditors as a whole. In order to
make an order, the court must be satisfied that it is reasonably likely that the administration will achieve one or more of
these purposes.

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order (in the case of
court appointment) is made or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court and, when an administrator
is appointed, a full statutory moratorium applies. Whilst there are a few exceptions, save where the court or (in the case of
a full statutory moratorium) the administrator consents, that moratorium prevents creditors taking any action against the
company to recover their debts including, among other things, commencing or continuing any legal process against the
company, winding up the company, enforcing security or repossessing goods in the company’s possession under a hire
purchase or similar agreement. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their
security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of
the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial
instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Arrangements
**Regulations”).**

Subject to the above points, were the English Guarantor to enter administration, it is possible that the security granted by
it may not be enforced while it is in administration. Similarly, whilst any principal debt or guarantee obligation owed by it
would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action could be taken in respect of any failure to pay.

Upon appointment, an administrator takes control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control
of all property to which the administrator thinks the company is entitled. While an administrator is in office in respect of
the English Guarantor, the powers of the board of directors of the English Guarantor (save those that do not interfere with
the exercise of that administrators' powers, and those permitted by the administrator) are suspended. The administrator has


-----

broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets which are subject to fixed charge security
(where powers are more restrictive). Administrators may dispose of property that is subject to a floating charge without the
consent of the relevant charge holder, which will have the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal as it
had in respect of the property disposed of. With the prior approval of the court, an administrator can dispose of property
subject to a fixed charge without the consent of the relevant secured creditor, provided that: the disposal is likely to promote
the administration’s purpose; and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question
(plus any additional amount required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court
as the net amount which would be realized on a sale of property at market value) towards discharging the obligations of
the company to the secured creditor.

An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and an administrator does not have the power to disclaim contracts
(although he or she can choose to breach a contract if he or she considers it to be in the best interests of the creditors as a
whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt.

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very limited
circumstances. The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying floating charge
where either the security document granting such charge pre-dates September 15, 2003 or where it falls within one of the
exceptions under the UK Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most relevant exception to the
prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as
defined in the UK Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the
relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets
investment” (which is defined in the UK Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument, and debt
instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the
company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the
person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the
administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid
floating charge (see “Transactions at an undervalue”, “Preference” and “Floating charges capable of being set aside”
below, respectively). If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office.

**_Liquidation / Winding-up_**

Liquidation proceedings may be opened where: (i) the company is registered in England and Wales or Scotland; (ii) the
debtor’s Retained EIR COMI is in the UK, or (iii) the debtor’s Retained EIR COMI is in an EU member state (other than
Denmark) and there is an establishment in the UK. The English courts can also open compulsory liquidation (see below)
in respect of foreign companies as unregistered companies if such foreign company has a sufficient connection to England
and Wales.

Liquidation is a procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors
in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the UK Insolvency Legislation. At the end of the liquidation process, the
company will normally be dissolved and removed from the register of companies. Liquidation proceedings can be opened
by a creditor filing a petition with a court to wind up the company (a “compulsory winding up”), which will in most cases
be on the ground that the company is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the UK Insolvency Act), or the
company resolving to do so in a general meeting of shareholders (a “voluntary winding up”), which in turn can be divided
into members’ voluntary liquidation and creditors' voluntary liquidation. The key differences between the two voluntary
winding-up proceedings is in a members’ voluntary winding-up, the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration
as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months prior to the members resolving to place the company into
liquidation. The process is controlled by the shareholders. Note that while a creditors' voluntary liquidation (other than as
an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is
subject to some degree of control by the creditors.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory
winding up, under Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company’s property, any transfer
of the company’s shares and any altering of the status of company members made after the commencement of the winding
up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a
company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a
winding up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or
proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court although there is no
freeze on the enforcement of security. In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the
retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a


-----

result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the UK Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a
voluntary winding-up – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply to court for a stay.
Ordinary practice is to grant the stay on proceedings brought by a creditor in respect of a debt that is largely admitted and
should be determined in the liquidation rather than through separate legal proceedings. As with a compulsory liquidation,
this is important because it means secured creditors, for example, can go ahead and enforce their security.

Regardless of how a liquidator is appointed, a liquidator owes his or her duties to the company and its creditors as a whole
and has wide powers to do whatever is necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. A liquidator has the power to agree,
compromise and pay creditor claims, bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business
of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property and execute documents
in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. While a liquidation does not in itself terminate
financial or commercial contracts, a liquidator does have the power to disclaim onerous property if he or she considers it
to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an unsecured debt.
Onerous property is any unprofitable contract or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may
give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, by giving the prescribed notice. A contract may be
unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may
be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because
the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does
not apply to an executed contract (being a contract under which all the obligations have been performed) nor can it, except
so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other
person. Any person suffering loss or damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor
of the company and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating charges – see
“Administrative Receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed charge in
accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute
under the Law of Property Act 1925, although it is standard market practice to augment the powers of any receiver
appointed through the relevant security document.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a
default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take
place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge
receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under
a “financial collateral arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations.

The primary duty of the fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which he or she is appointed, meaning he or she
owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his or her
duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas
administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to
obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory
indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the
benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the
proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part (as defined below) and any preferential creditors.

**_Priority of claims in UK insolvency proceedings_**

In the liquidation of the English Guarantor or its administration (where the relevant administrator makes a distribution),
the insolvent company’s assets will be realized and distributed to its creditors. Creditors are placed into different classes
and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s
property applied in a descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined
below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking
class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari
_passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class._

Whereas the principle of pari passu distribution would dis-allow contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a
company enters liquidation or an administrator issues notice of his/her intention to make a distribution of assets to creditors,
it does not prevent the effect of mandatory insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each
party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable
in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the creditor) or, conversely, is payable by


-----

the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the company).

The general statutory order of priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

  - First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in
the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the company but only to the extent of the realizations
from those secured assets or with respect to the value of the asset in which they have a proprietary interest;

  - Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there
is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which those expenses are paid);

  - Third ranking claims: ordinary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), which include (but are
not limited to) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, employment claims (wages and salaries
of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person
and holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place
before or after the insolvency date);

  - Fourth ranking claims: secondary preferential debts (these rank equally among themselves), including (but not
limited to) claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan
repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation
tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers;

  - Fifth ranking claims: subject to certain exceptions, the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of money
that the administrator or liquidator must set aside from realizations from floating charge assets for the benefit of
unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge
realizations, and unless the cost of making the prescribed part available to unsecured creditors would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors) (the “Prescribed Part”). calculated as 50 per cent of the first
£10,000 of net realizations and 20 per cent of the net realizations thereafter, up to a maximum aggregate cap of
£800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking
floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000);

  - Sixth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets
according to the priority of their security. However, before distributing such asset realizations to the holders of
floating charges, the Prescribed Part must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured
creditors;

  - Seventh ranking claims: general

        - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and secured creditors to the extent of any unsecured
shortfall (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place
between any of them) in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured
shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors
are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall unless the Prescribed
Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

        - secondly, statutory interest that arises on debts after the commencement of liquidation or after the
commencement of an administration which has been converted into a distributing administration at the
higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act
1838; and

        - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and
which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and

  - Eigth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company, provided that it is in the process of
being wound up. There are no equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured
shareholder loan ranks as a provable debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the subordination
language in the relevant documentation.

**_Fixed and Floating charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security: (a) a fixed
charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the same
charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted); (b) general
costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s or administrator’s remuneration and the costs of continuing to operate the
business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in a winding up or administration are payable
out of the charging company’s assets (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and
insolvency officeholders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to
meet such general costs and expenses in priority to floating charge claims; (c) an administrator may dispose of or take
action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the
floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the
floating charge; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject
to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by
the charging company so as to give a third-party good title to the assets free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to
the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge security; (e) in comparison to fixed
charge security, floating charge security is subject to certain additional challenges under English insolvency law; and (f)
where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge
over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims)
under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations, floating charge security is subject to the claims of certain
preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ringfencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors. This summary does not set out an exhaustive statement of
consequences of the distinction between fixed and floating security interests.

**_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the security
documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed
charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather
than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of
control over the English Guarantor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such
control is exercised by the holder of the security in practice. Where the English Guarantor is free to deal with the assets
that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be
likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described
as a fixed charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to
create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its
receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent
of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any
unsecured creditors of the English Guarantor in respect of that part of the English Guarantor’s net property which comprises
the ring fenced Prescribed Part (see explanation about ring fencing under “—Priority of Claims in UK Insolvency
_Proceedings” above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the English Guarantor may have priority_
over the rights of the Security Agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the
expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the Security Agent as floating charge
holder.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Collateral_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of a guarantee or
security interest can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or liquidator is appointed to the
company within a specified period (as set forth in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security interest
and, in certain circumstances, if the company was unable to pay its debts when the guarantee or security interest was
granted or became unable to pay its debts as a result of granting the guarantee or security interest. If the Guarantee or any
security interest granted by the English Guarantor is successfully challenged under the laws of England and Wales, and the
court makes certain findings (as described further below), the court may:

  - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of the English Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantee or security interests
provided by it;

  - direct that the Holders of the Notes return any amounts paid to them by the English Guarantor under the Guarantee,
either directly to the English Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the English Guarantor’s creditors generally;
and/or


-----

  - take other action that may be detrimental to the Holders of the Notes.

The English Guarantor cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as described
below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes
would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

_Onset of insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating
charges (as discussed below), depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is
made; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the
appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the windingup petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant windingup resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial
administration.

_Connected persons_

If the given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge (as described below) has been entered into
by the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an
undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director;
(c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife or
civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; or (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a
relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relevative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil
partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A company is associated with another
company if the same person has control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his
associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has
control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same
persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has
control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to
exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of
another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are
to be taken as having control of the company.

The following potential grounds of challenge may apply to the Guarantee and/or security interests given by the English
Guarantor under the UK Insolvency Act:

**_Transaction at an Undervalue_**

Under Section 238 of the UK Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a guarantee granted or collateral provided by a company (or give other relief) on the grounds that the
creation of such guarantee or provision of collateral constituted a transaction at an undervalue. Liquidators and
administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any transaction
under Section 238 of the UK Insolvency Act. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under the CBIR,
he or she also has standing to bring a claim for a transaction at an undervalue.

The grant of a guarantee or provision of collateral will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company either receives
no consideration in return for the guarantee or provision of collateral, or receives consideration of significantly less value,
in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by it. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee must be granted
or the collateral must be provided within a period of two years ending with the onset of the company’s insolvency (as
defined in Section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act).

In addition the company must either be “unable to pay its debts” when it grants the guarantee or provides the collateral or
become unable to pay its debts as a result. Even if these tests are satisfied, a court will not make an order in respect of a


-----

transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose
of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would
benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, it will
make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered
into (which could include reducing payments under the relevant guarantee or setting it or the provision of the collateral
aside). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was
unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction is a “connected person” of the English company (as defined
in the UK Insolvency Act - see “Connected persons” above), in which case there is a presumption, unless the contrary is
shown, that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and the connected person must demonstrate that
the company was in fact solvent.

**_Preference_**

Under section 239 of the UK Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a guarantee or security interest granted by such company (or give other relief) on the grounds that such
guarantee or security interest constituted a preference. Liquidators and administrators may assign the cause of action
(including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any preference claim under section 239 of the UK Insolvency
Act. Where a foreign officeholder has been granted recognition under the CBIR he or she also has standing to bring a
preference claim.

The grant of a guarantee or security interest will be a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or
guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the guarantee or
security interest had not been granted. The company must either have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the
transaction or become so unable as a result of the transaction. A challenge can only be made if the guarantee or security
interest was granted within the period of (i) six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of
the UK Insolvency Act—see above) if the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is not a connected person or (ii)
if the beneficiary is a connected person of the English company, two years ending with the onset of insolvency.

A court should not make an order that a preference has been granted unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in
deciding to enter into the relevant transaction by a desire to put the relevant creditor in a better position in the event of the
company’s liquidation. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other
commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position. If the court determines that the
transaction was a preference, it will make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if
that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting them or any
security interests aside). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company
was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential
effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption, unless the
contrary is shown, that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person
must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was in fact no such influence.

**_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_**

Under Section 423 of the UK Insolvency Act, a liquidator or an administrator of a company, or a person who is a victim
of the relevant transaction (with leave of the court if the company is in liquidation and a moratorium on creditor action is
in place with respect to that company, or if the company is in administration), could apply to the court for an order to set
aside a guarantee or collateral on the grounds that the guarantee or provision of collateral was a transaction defrauding
creditors. A claim can also be made by, subject to certain conditions, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential
Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. A foreign officeholder recognized under the CBIR also has standing
to apply to court.

A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it satisfies the criteria for being a transaction at an
undervalue (see above) and the court is satisfied that the substantial purpose of the company in entering into the transaction
was to put assets beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against the company or to prejudice the interests of such
persons in relation to their actual or potential claim.

There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within which the company must enter insolvency proceedings
for this ground of challenge to be available (although general statutory limitation periods will apply) and the relevant
company does not need to be unable to pay its debts at the time or as a result of the relevant transaction for a challenge
under this head of claim to be made out. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no
defense to the claim. It will suffice that the company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of
creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose
is likely to suffice.


-----

If the court determines the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, it may make such order as it sees fit to restore
the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims
of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting it or the collateral aside). The relevant court
order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom
the transaction was entered into. However, such an order may not prejudice any interest in property that was acquired from
a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances or require a third party who received
a benefit from the relevant transaction that acted in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances
to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction.

**_Extortionate credit transactions_**

Under Section 244 of the UK Insolvency Act, a liquidator or an administrator of a company (or a foreign officeholder
recognized under the CBIR) could apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. Liquidators and
administrators may assign the cause of action (including the proceeds of the cause of action) in respect of any extortionate
credit transaction claim under Section 244 of the UK Insolvency Act.

The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into by the English Guarantor up to three years before the day
on which the English Guarantor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if,
having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly
exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the
credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**_Floating charges capable of being set aside_**

Section 245 of the UK Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by an English
company during the “relevant time” will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods
or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of (and the amount of such interest payable in respect
of the money paid, services supplied, or discharge or reduction of debt), the relevant English company at the same time as
or after the creation of the floating charge (the “Consideration”). This means that a floating charge can be partly invalid
to the extent that it is provided for past consideration.

In the case of a floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not connected to the English Guarantor, the
relevant time is deemed to be the period of 12 months ending with the onset of the English Guarantor’s insolvency provided
that at the time the charge was granted the English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts or became unable to pay its debts
as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted. If the floating charge is created in favor
of a person connected to the English Guarantor, the relevant look back time is a period of two years ending with the onset
of insolvency and there is no requirement that at the time the charge was granted the English Guarantor was unable to pay
its debts or became unable to pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted.

Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantor becomes unable to pay its debts within a period of up to two years of
the issuance of the Notes, any floating charge created during the relevant time period will be automatically invalid, except
to the value of the Consideration received by the English Guarantor. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) will not
need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law save for where there is a
foreign officeholder recognized under the CBIR who wishes to attack the floating charge under article 23 of the CBIR.

However, if the floating charge qualifies as a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral
Arrangements Regulations, the floating charge will not be void as described in this paragraph.

**_Enforcement_**

Enforcement of security and guarantees may be affected by general legal and equitable principles regarding the legality,
validity and enforceability of contractual provisions and contractual obligations and liabilities (including guarantees and
security).

**_Equitable share charge_**

The fixed charges over shares in companies incorporated in England and Wales granted by a Guarantor are equitable
charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor transfers the beneficial interest in the shares to the
chargee but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable
considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.


-----

**_Application of proceeds_**

The enforceability of a provision in a security document that relates to the application of proceeds will be subject to any
obligations mandatorily preferred by applicable law.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, any debt of a
company payable in a currency other than British pounds (such as euros in the case of the Notes) must be converted into
British pounds at a single rate for each currency determined by the officeholder by reference to the exchange rates
prevailing on the date that the company went into administration or liquidation. This provision overrides any agreement
between the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court to determine the rate.

Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be
subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which the English Guarantor goes into liquidation or administration and
receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become entitled (by way of distribution in the liquidation
or administration).

**_Post-petition interest_**

Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Guarantee to which the English Guarantor is a party (at
the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of
administration or liquidation proceedings would only be recoverable from any surplus remaining after payment of all other
debts proved in the English Guarantor’s insolvency proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of the
commencement of those proceedings provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured
assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries.

**_Trust Assets_**

Assets held on trust by the company for a third party generally fall outside the insolvent estate that is available for
distribution.

**_Ranking_**

The description given by the parties to the ranking of security interests is not determinative of the ranking of those security
interests.

**_Foreign laws_**

If, and to the extent that, an asset subject to security under a security document (or the obligor of any debt or other right
against any person, which debt or right constitutes all or part of the property or rights subject to that security) is located in
any jurisdiction other than England and Wales or is not governed by English law, the validity and priority of that security
may be affected by any applicable foreign laws.

**_Third party rights_**

Security granted over debts from, or other rights against, third parties (including contracts and insurance policies) may be
subject to any rights of those third parties.

**_Amendments_**

An English court may interpret restrictively any provision purporting to allow the beneficiary of a guarantee or other
suretyship to make a material amendment to the obligations to which the guarantee or suretyship relates without further
reference to the guarantor or surety.

**_Fetters on exercise of powers_**

A provision under which a company or other legal person agrees, or purports to agree, to fetter the exercise of its powers
under its constitutional documents or any applicable law (or regulation) may not be enforceable against the company or
other legal person.


-----

**_Account banks’ right to set off_**

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an “Account Charge”) granted by the English Guarantor over any of
its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may hold a right at
any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of
netting or set off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that English Guarantor. As
a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral
constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set off with
respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized and
converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to
the relevant English Guarantor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer
be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set off rights (unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved setoff rights in such circumstances, albeit the Account Bank is unable to contract out of insolvency set-off whereby mandatory
rules of insolvency set-off apply as soon as the English Guarantor were to enter administration or liquidation), since the
Account Bank will only be entitled to exercise its netting and set off rights until such time as it is informed that the beneficial
interest in the debt represented by the account credit balance has been transferred to a third party.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Notes Guarantees and Collateral_**

Independent of provisions of UK insolvency law, the grant of the Guarantee and provision of the Collateral by the English
Guarantor in respect of the obligations of another Group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More
specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the English Guarantor’s memorandum and articles of association. To
the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the Guarantee or provision of the
Collateral can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for
third parties if they are dealing with the company in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties
in its interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for the company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed
transaction. Section 172 of the CA06 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be
most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a
transaction where there is no or insufficient corporate benefit for the company in question, they may be found as abusing
their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the CA06
additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of
the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors’ duties to creditors arise, a majority decision
of the Supreme Court has held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in
question is insolvent or is bordering on insolvency or that an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an obligor incorporated in England and Wales may also be subject to potential
limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions (including the application of the Financial Collateral
Arrangements Regulations), any security granted by a chargor incorporated in England and Wales (including security
governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) should be delivered
to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest in
accordance with Chapter A1 of Part 25 of the CA06. While the CA06 does not impose an obligation as such on English
companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator,
administrator and any creditor of the applicable chargor if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes
so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited
circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the
relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar
of Companies. Security created on or after October 1, 2011 by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales does
not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Registration with applicable asset registries may, however, still
be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. Registration may also determine the order of priority of
registrable security interests and may provide notice of a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities.

**_Restructuring procedures_**

As well as formal insolvency proceedings, there are various restructuring tools under the laws of England and Wales which
the English Guarantor may be subject to and which may adversely affect investors and their ability to enforce their rights
relating to the Notes or the Guarantees. Some of these processes are under the CA06 (e.g. a scheme of arrangement and a
restructuring plan) and some under the UK Insolvency Act (e.g. a company voluntary arrangement). Further details on the


-----

these processes are set out below.

**_Schemes of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the CA06, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction
a compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors (or classes of creditors) where such company is liable
to be wound up under the UK Insolvency Act. In order for a scheme of arrangement proposed by a non UK company to be
sanctioned by the English courts, the relevant company must also have a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

In previous cases, a sufficient connection has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where, among other things:
the relevant company has assets situated in England or carries on business there; its COMI is in England; and/or it owes
liabilities to creditors based in England or under agreements governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be
considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of
the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote at a creditors’ meeting on
the proposed compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such
creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are to be granted under the
scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. The scheme will be passed at a creditors’
meeting if a majority in number representing 75% or more in value of those creditors present and voting either in person
or by proxy at the relevant creditors’ meeting vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval
thresholds contained in the finance documents. Provided that all the classes of creditors in respect of which crediors’s
meetings are covened vote in favor of the scheme, the scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all
affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme and those who voted
against the scheme. In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order
to ensure the effectiveness of the compromise. Following the creditors’ voting at the meeting, the scheme then needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether
there has been compliance with the statutory requirements, whether the class(es) were fairly represented (and did the
majority act in a bona fide manner and for the proper purposes when voting), whether the scheme is one which an intelligent
and honest person, acting in respect of their interests, might reasonably approve and whether there are otherwise any blots
or defects in the scheme. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order
conditional upon modifications being made to the scheme or reject the scheme.

**_Restructuring plan_**

Pursuant to Part 26A of the CA06, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a compromise or arrangement (a
“Restructuring Plan”) proposed between a company and its creditors and/or members (or any class of its creditors and/or
members) in circumstances where the company has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that affect,
or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern. The purpose of the Restructuring Plan must be to
eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of these financial difficulties. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, the
Restructuring Plan procedure is open to any company liable to be wound up under the UK Insolvency Act (i.e., a foreign
company may use the procedure provided that certain conditions are met).

For a consensual plan (i.e., one where each class of creditors and/or members votes in favor) to be capable of being
sanctioned by the court, the Restructuring Plan must be approved by 75% by value of creditors or members in each class
present in person or by proxy and voting at each meeting convened to consider the Restructuring Plan (there is no majority
by number test unlike with a scheme of arrangement). The applicant may also apply to the court to exclude a class from
voting if they have no genuine economic interest in the company. Unlike a scheme, if the Restructuring Plan is not approved
by a number representing at least 75% in value of any class of creditors or members of the company present in person or
by proxy and voting at the relevant plan meeting (the “Dissenting Class”), the Dissenting Class may be “crammed down”
provided that: (i) the court is satisfied that no members of the Dissenting Class would be any worse off under the
Restructuring Plan than they would be in the most likely alternative scenario (in the court’s view) if the Restructuring Plan
is not sanctioned (the ‘relevant alternative’); and (ii) the Restructuring Plan is agreed by 75% by value of a class of creditors
or (as the case may be) members present in person or by proxy and voting at the relevant plan meeting who would receive
a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the relevant alternative. Even if the voting
threshold is met, the court has discretion as to whether to sanction the Restructuring Plan and will refuse to sanction if it is
not ‘just and equitable’ to do so. If the Restructuring Plan is sanctioned, it will be binding on all affected parties, including
those who did not participate in the vote on the Restructuring Plan and those who voted against the Restructuring Plan.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangement ("CVA")_**

A company voluntary arrangement is a procedure intended to allow companies to avoid potentially terminal insolvency
proceedings and to address their financial difficulties by obtaining a binding agreement or compromise with their unsecured


-----

creditors. Although it does not result in the insolvency of a company, a company voluntary arrangement is implemented
under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who acts as the nominee before the company voluntary proposals are
approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. A company voluntary arrangement may also be used as a tool alongside a
formal insolvency procedure, such as administration, in order to implement a compromise between the debtor company
and its creditors.

English courts are empowered to oversee company voluntary arrangements in respect of companies within their general
jurisdiction, together with companies incorporated in England and Wales, Scotland or an EEA State or with their respective
COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark) and those which have either their Retained EIR COMI in
an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an establishment in the UK, or their Retained EIR COMI in the UK.

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may
propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or
other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts.
Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind
all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the right
of a secured creditor to enforce its security, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of
the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors
may vote against it. A simple majority of the company’s members must also have voted on the proposal. However, if the
company’s creditors approve the proposal, the CVA will be implemented notwithstanding a vote against by the members.
Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement, however, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that
its claims are undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt
may be deemed to have given up its security.

**_Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_**

One of the common challenges involved in using a formal process to rescue and restructure a company is that it can trigger
termination or other consequences under supplier contracts. This makes the company vulnerable to ransom creditors.
Recent changes to the UK Insolvency Act have been introduced in order to supplement the existing essential supplier
regime (see below) to help the continuation of supply of goods and services to companies in an insolvency process.

**_Essential suppliers_**

The essential supplier regime under sections 233 and 233A of the UK Insolvency Act prevents the suppliers from, where
a company is subject to a qualifying form of insolvency procedure (including administration, liquidation and CVA) and a
request is made by or with the concurrence of the insolvency officerholder for the giving, after the date that insolvency
procedure commenced or the CVA took effect (as applicable), of any essential supplies, making it a condition of the giving
of the supply, or doing anything which has the effect of making it a condition of the giving of the supply, that any
outstanding charges in respect of a supply given to the company before the effective date are paid; and where a company
enters administration or a CVA takes effect, subject to certain exceptions, compels continued supply by restricting the
effect of existing insolvency-related terms in contracts for the supply of essential goods or services.

Essential goods and services include such things as water, gas, electricity, communications services, wi-fi and chip-andpin devices.

**_Other suppliers_**

Section 233B of the UK Insolvency Act provides that (subject to certain exceptions), if a company is subject to a qualifying
form of insolvency procedure (including CVA, administration and liquidation or where a court order is made summoning
a meeting relating to a Restructuring Plan), (i) any provision of a supply contract which provides that the contract or supply
would terminate, or any other thing would take place, or that the supplier would be entitled to terminate the contract or the
supply or do any other thing (for example, change payment or supply terms) because the company becomes subject to the
relevant insolvency procedure, will cease to have effect; (ii) suppliers will be unable to exercise any entitlement arising
before the start of the insolvency period to terminate the contract or the supply because of an event occurring before the
start of the insolvency period, for the duration of the insolvency period (which in some cases could be measured in years)
and (iii) suppliers will be unable to make it a condition of the giving of the supply, that any outstanding charges in respect
of a supply given to the company before the effective date are paid as a condition of continuing supply.

Suppliers may still terminate contracts if the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants
permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Supplier
rights relating to events arising after the insolvency process begins are not affected.


-----

The prohibitions apply to both new and pre-existing contracts. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving
financial services including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the
purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the
issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act). In addition, certain types of entities (such as
banks or insurance companies), whether such entities are the customer or the supplier, are excluded from this regime.
Additionally, the regime does not apply to insolvency-related terms of a contract for the supply of essential goods or
services which cease to have effect under section 233A of the UK Insolvency Act (as described above).

**TAXATION**

**CERTAIN GERMAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Income received from the Notes is subject to taxation. In particular, the tax laws of any jurisdiction with authority to impose_
_taxes on the holder and the tax laws of the Issuer’s state of incorporation, statutory seat and place of effective management,_
_i.e., Germany, might have an impact on the income received from the Notes._

_The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and disposal of the_
_Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax considerations that may be relevant to a_
_decision to purchase Notes, and, in particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a_
_particular purchaser. This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of_
_this offering memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

_Potential purchasers of the Notes should be aware that (i) the tax treatment of payments in respect of the Notes may be_
_different (and in some cases significantly different) from that set out below, and (ii) tax laws and regulations and their_
_application or interpretation by the relevant taxation authorities or courts may change from time to time (including the flat_
_tax rate described below). Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the precise tax treatment of the Notes which will apply_
_to a particular investor at any given time._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the_
_purchase, ownership and disposal of the Notes, including the effect of any state, local or church taxes, under the tax laws_
_of Germany and any country of which they are resident or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons._

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing payments, such as interest payments, received by an individual holder of the Notes will be subject to German
withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account with (a) a German branch
of a German or non German credit or financial services institution, (b) a German securities institution or (c) – if no German
branch of a German or non-German credit or financial services institution or German securities institution is the Disbursing
Agent – the Issuer (each, a “Disbursing Agent”, auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity
surcharge (Solidaritätszuschlag) at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%); with respect to the
solidarity surcharge see “—Partial Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge”. If the individual holder is subject to church tax
(Kirchensteuer), a church tax surcharge will also be withheld. The church tax surcharge is automatically withheld by the
Disbursing Agent, unless the holder notifies the Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) that it objects
to automatic withholding. In this case, the holder has to include the capital investment income in his or her tax return and
will be assessed to church tax (if applicable).

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest”, Stückzinsen) derived by an individual
holder irrespective of any holding period provided the Notes have been kept or administered in a custodial account with
the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition. If Notes kept or administered in the same custodial account
were acquired at different points in time, the Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold first for the purposes
of determining any capital gains. Where the Notes are acquired and/or sold in a currency other than Euro, the
sales/redemption price and/or the acquisition costs have to be converted into Euro on the basis of the foreign exchange
rates prevailing on the sale or redemption date and the acquisition date, respectively. The separation of interest claims or
interest coupons from the Notes is treated as disposition of the Notes at their fair market value which has to be apportioned
to the capital and the interest strips. If interest claims or interest coupons are disposed of separately (i.e., without the Notes),
the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption or
collection of interest claims or interest coupons if the Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent
since the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a
rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if
applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (including Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has
been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement
of a credit, financial services or securities institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or certain
other countries, e.g., Switzerland.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of the withholding
tax certain negative capital investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g.,
losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares) and carry forward any losses that cannot be offset to


-----

the following calendar year. If losses cannot be offset in full against positive capital investment income by the Disbursing
Agent, the holder can instead request that the Disbursing Agent issues a certificate stating the losses in order for them to
be offset against other positive income from capital investments or carried forward in the assessment procedure. The request
has to reach the Disbursing Agent by 15 December of the current year and is irrevocable. The Disbursing Agent may also
deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via
the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign
withholding taxes levied on capital investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in
the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent, the Disbursing
Agent will take up to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for married couples and for
partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing
jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing
Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate
of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax office.

Subject to further (procedural) requirements being met, German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including
Notes held via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal
forms the tax status of the corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while ongoing
payments, such as interest payments, are generally subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax
and losses incurred). The same applies where the Notes form part of a German trade or business (of an individual or a
commercial partnership) subject to further requirements being met.

Interest and capital gains on the Notes received by non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German
withholding tax or the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German
taxation (as set forth under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non Tax Residents”) and the Notes are
kept or administered in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain
circumstances. The withholding tax may be (fully or partially) refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an
applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

Payments made to a holder of the notes resident in a so called“non-cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht kooperatives
_Steuerhoheitsgebiet) within the meaning of the Defense against Tax Havens Act (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung_
_und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze –“StAbwG”) may generally be subject to a (definitive)_
tax deduction by the Issuer in Germany at a tax rate of 15% (plus solidarity surcharge in an amount of 5.5% of such tax)
of the gross payment. However, according to recently introduced legislation, there should be no obligation to deduct tax in
the case of bearer notes (Inhaberschuldverschreibungen), such as the Notes, represented by a global note (Globalurkunde),
and held in collective safe custody (Girosammelverwahrung) with a central depositary or similar instruments, in each case
which are tradable on certain recognized stock exchanges.

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence,
habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management is located in Germany).

Income (i.e., interest and capital gains) derived under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany,
irrespective of any holding period, is in general subject to German income tax at a flat tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity
surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Notes are held as private investment
(Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance
(Sparer—Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered
partnership law (Gesetz über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher
expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from capital
investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld. To the extent withholding tax has not been
levied, such as in the case no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment process, the individual holder must include
his or her interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in his or her tax return and will then also be taxed at a
rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). If the withholding tax on a disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual
gain), an individual holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds, must apply for an
assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs unless, according to administrative guidance, the difference


-----

between the actual gain and 30% of the respective proceeds does not exceed €500 and there are no further circumstances
requiring a tax assessment. Further, an individual holder may apply for a tax assessment on the basis of general rules
applicable to him or her if the resulting individual income tax burden is lower than 25% with any amounts of German tax
over withheld being refunded. The deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not
permitted.

Capital losses from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes held as private investment should
generally be tax-recognized irrespective of the holding period of the Notes. The losses may, however, not be used to offset
other income like employment or business income but may only be offset against capital investment income subject to
certain limitations. Losses not utilized in one year may be carried forward into subsequent years but may not be carried
back into preceding years. However, if the losses result from the full or partial non-recoverability of the repayment claim
under the Notes including a default of the Issuer or a (voluntary) waiver, or from a write-off of worthless notes, from the
transfer of worthless notes to a third party or from any other default (Ausfall), such losses together with other losses of such
kind of the same year and loss-carry forwards of previous years can only be offset up to an amount of €20,000 per annum
("Limitation on Loss Deduction"). Any exceeding loss amount can be carried forward and offset against future capital
investment income, but again subject to the €20,000 limitation. Given that certain losses (e.g., losses which are subject to
the Limitation on Loss Deduction) will not be applied by the German Disbursing Agent (as defined above) holding the
Notes in custody, holders suffering losses which are subject to the Limitation on Loss Deduction are required to declare
such losses in their income tax return.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or where the income from the Notes
qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or
corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge
and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Where Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued
Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder will have to include income and
related (business) expenses in the tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding
tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder
or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, will be refunded. Where Notes form part of a
German trade or business the current income and capital gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of
the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade
tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz) of the relevant municipality where the holder’s business is located. If the holder is an
individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may be completely or partly credited against the personal
income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

Partnerships can opt to be treated as a corporation for purposes of German income taxation. If the holder of the Notes is a
partnership that has validly exercised such option right, any interest payments on Notes (including Accrued Interest) and
capital gains from the disposal or redemption of Notes are subject to corporate income tax (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
trade tax).

_Non Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management is not located in Germany).

Interest, including Accrued Interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not tax resident in Germany are generally
not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment,
including a permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise
constitutes German source income (e.g., such as income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German
situs real estate (or other assets that are from a German civil law perspective treated as real estate) or ships which are
registered with a German ship register (unless the Notes qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of
Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibung)) or income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs real estate or income from profit
participating instruments). Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German
withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over the counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent
and the Notes are not held in custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. To the extent the German source income
is subject to German withholding tax, this withholding tax is, in general final and the German tax liability is satisfied by
the tax withheld. Where the German source income is not subject to German withholding tax or in case (i) of this paragraph
(i.e., if Notes form part of the business property of a German permanent establishment), a tax regime similar to that
explained above under “—Tax Residents” applies. Subject to certain requirements, a holder who is not tax resident in
Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable double taxation treaty
(Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen) and German tax law.


-----

Where the Issuer makes a tax deduction from a payment to a holder of the Notes tax resident in a non-cooperative
jurisdiction under the StAbwG (as set forth under "—Withholding Tax"), such holder should in principle incur a definitive
tax charge.

**_Bond Premium_**

If the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen) and if a German holder purchases a Note for an amount (not
including any amount paid for pre issuance accrued interest) that is greater than the principal amount of the Note, the bond
premium is part of the acquisition costs which are deducted from the proceeds upon the disposal, redemption, repayment
or assignment of the Notes.

According to the German tax authority, German holders, holding the Notes as their trade or business assets
(Betriebsvermögen) could be obliged to create a deferred item (Rechnungsabgrenzungsposten) in the amount of the bond
premium which is to be dissolved linearly over the term of the Note. Moreover, under certain circumstances, the German
Holder may amortize (wholly or partly) a bond premium before disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the
Notes.

**_Partial Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge_**

As of the assessment period 2021, the solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished for certain individuals and reduced
for certain other individuals, depending on certain income thresholds. The solidarity surcharge continues to apply for capital
investment income and, thus, on withholding taxes levied (including the flat tax regime) as well as to corporate income
tax. In case the individual income tax burden for an individual holder is lower than 25%, the holder can apply for his or
her capital investment income being assessed at his or her individual tariff-based income tax rate in which case solidarity
surcharge would be refunded. Holders are advised to monitor further future developments.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or gift tax if the decedent
or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany
or in certain cases for German citizens who previously maintained a residence in Germany. If neither the holder nor the
recipient is a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes
will be levied unless (i) the Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent establishment or
fixed base is maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii), the obligations under the
Notes are directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (or other real estate-like rights) or ships which are
registered with a German ship register (unless the Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)).

In addition, certain German expatriates will be subject to inheritance and gift tax. Should a double taxation treaty be
applicable in the individual case, however, German taxation provisions may be restricted thereby.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes will be payable in Germany in connection with the issuance, delivery or execution of
the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, except for any notarial fees). However, under certain conditions, entrepreneurs (for
value added tax purposes) may opt for a liability to value added tax with regard to the sale of the Notes which would
otherwise be tax exempt. Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**_The Proposed Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)_**

In 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transaction tax (“FTT”)
in certain EU Member States. The proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in the form of the proposal,
apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The proposed
FTT Directive has not yet been implemented. However, some jurisdictions (e.g., Italy and France) have introduced a
domestic financial transaction tax that may apply to certain dealings in the Securities in certain circumstances. Other
jurisdictions may also introduce a domestic financial transaction tax. Subject to the final scope of any FTT, holders of the
Notes could be exposed to higher transaction fees.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT and domestic
financial transaction taxes.


-----

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion is limited to U.S. holders (defined below) who purchase the Notes
for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to
the public (not including bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers)) and hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the United
States Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”) (generally assets held for investment purposes). The following
discussion does not address certain considerations that may apply to particular holders including, but not limited to, tax
exempt entities, holders subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, U.S. expatriates, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities who elect to apply a mark to market method of accounting, certain financial institutions,
insurance companies, regulated investment companies, partnerships or other pass through entities (or investors in such
entities), U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar, persons who hold the Notes in connection with a
“straddle”, “hedging”, “conversion” or other risk reduction transaction, and holders in their capacity as holders of the
Notes. This discussion does not address the tax considerations relevant to holders of the Notes under any state, local or non
U.S. tax laws or any other tax laws other than the U.S. federal income tax laws, or the consequences to taxpayers subject
to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code.

The discussion below is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury Regulations”),
court decisions, revenue rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) currently
in force, all as of the date of this Offering, and all of which are subject to change or changes in interpretation. Prospective
investors should particularly note that any such change or changes in interpretation could have retroactive effect so as to
result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. Consequently, prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors as to the consequences of holding the Notes.

As used herein, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

- an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

- a corporation (or any other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state or political subdivision thereof or the District of
Columbia;

- an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

- a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the
trust and one or more U.S. persons control all of the substantial decisions of the trust or if a valid election is in
place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is an owner of the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment
of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A
holder of the Notes that is a partnership and partners in such partnership should consult their own tax advisors regarding
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of the Notes.

**Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to**
**them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including the tax consequences under any state, local,**
**non-U.S. and other tax laws.**

**_Characterization of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see, e.g., “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”, “Description of the Notes—Payment
_of Additional Amounts” and “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control”)_
we may be obligated to make payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. If (i) the exercise of the
Issuer’s option to redeem the Notes is not remote and (ii) it is not significantly more likely than not that no Change of
Control will occur, the Notes could be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
We intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. This position is binding on a holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the
manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required
to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in
accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully
challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required
to accrue interest income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity, to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain,
any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of such a Note, and to recognize foreign currency


-----

exchange gain or loss with respect to such income. This disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent
payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to
the Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Interest_**

Payments of stated interest (including any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding
taxes imposed on payments on the Notes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) on a Note generally will be
includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as foreign source ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received
or accrued, depending on the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and, for purposes
of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income).

A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated
at the “spot rate” on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S.
dollars. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment,
but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received.

A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise
is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of
interest income in euros that has accrued with respect to a Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such
accrued income may be determined by translating such income at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period
or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial period within each
taxable year. Alternatively, an accrual basis holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income
at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period within
each taxable year, in the case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year), or at the spot rate on the date of
receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of a Note that uses the
accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes may recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to
accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal
the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (translated at the “spot rate” on the date
such payment is received) in respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued
during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars.
Such exchange gain or loss will generally constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes,
as U.S. source income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income and expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

A series of Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event,
U.S. holders of such series of Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders of such series of Notes will generally
include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

A series of Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such series of Notes exceeds its issue
price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025
multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date).

In the event that a series of Notes is issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note of such series includible
in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the
taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to
each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note
may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than
one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The
amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue
price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity”, determined on the basis of compounding at the
close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest
allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period is equal to its issue
price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period and decreased by any payments other than stated interest.
The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and
interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note.


-----

OID, if any, on a series of Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars in
accordance with one of the methods described above in the third paragraph under “—Interest”.

A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of
a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the
difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the
date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above.
For these purposes, all receipts on a Note (other than payments of stated interest) will be viewed first, as receipts of
previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and
second, as receipts of principal. Such foreign currency gain or loss will generally constitute ordinary income or loss and be
treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to
interest income and expense The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective investors should consult
their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay between the application of
the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss above, stated interest income (including any amounts withheld and any
Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Notes) and OID, if any, on a Note
generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be considered “passive category income” in computing
the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by
a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such
credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. If a U.S. holder does not meet a minimum
holding period with respect to the Notes during which the holder is not protected from risk of loss, such holder generally
will not receive a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes. Certain U.S. Treasury Regulations
that apply to foreign income tax paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 restrict the
availability of any such credit based on the nature of the tax imposed by certain non-U.S. jurisdiction (although Notice
2023-55 provides temporary relief from the application of certain aspects of these regulations and such relief has been
extended by Notice 2023-80 indefinitely until new guidance or regulations are issued). The rules governing the foreign tax
credit are complex. The calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S.
holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their independent tax advisors regarding the availability of
foreign tax credits.

**_Sale and Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss in an
amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated
interest, which, to the extent not previously included in income, will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance
with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above and exchange gain or loss on such accrued and unpaid
interest) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will
equal the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on
that date, increased by prior accruals of OID, if any. The amount realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition
of a Note for an amount of euros will be the U.S. dollar value of that amount on (i) the date payment is received in the case
of a cash basis U.S. holder, (ii) the date of disposition in the case of an accrual basis U.S. holder, or (iii) the settlement date
(if the Note is traded on an established securities market) in the case of a cash basis U.S. holder (and, if it elects, an accrual
basis U.S. holder). If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a U.S. holder will have a tax basis in the euro
received equal to the U.S. dollar value of such amount on the settlement date. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the
election described in this paragraph, the election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and
cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable
to changes in currency exchange rates relating to the principal thereof will be ordinary income or loss and will generally
be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in euros, determined
on the date of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price
of the Note in euros, determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. In addition, a U.S. holder may recognize
foreign currency gain or loss with respect to amounts of previously accrued and unpaid stated interest and accrued OID, if
any, based on the difference between the rate of exchange at which the interest or OID was included in income and the
applicable rate of exchange at which the holder is required to translate euros at the time the Note matures or is otherwise
disposed of. The foregoing foreign exchange gain or loss will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss
realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will generally be treated as
U.S. source ordinary income or loss for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.


-----

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange
or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain
or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year at the time of the sale or other disposition. In the case of noncorporate U.S. holder (including an individual), any such long term capital gain generally will be subject to preferential
U.S. federal income tax rates if that U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of
capital losses is subject to significant limitations.

**_Receipt of Euros_**

The tax basis of any euros received by a U.S. holder generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the euros at the spot rate
of exchange on the date the euros are received. Upon any subsequent exchange of euros for U.S. dollars, a U.S. holder
generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of U.S. dollars received and the
U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euros. Upon any subsequent exchange of euros for property (including non U.S. currency), a
U.S. holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the
euros exchanged for such property based on the U.S. dollar spot rate of exchange for euros on the date of the exchange and
the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euros so exchanged. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S.
source ordinary income or loss.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS including, in certain
circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or foreign currency received in respect
of a Note to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a foreign currency tax loss
in excess of a threshold amount. If investors fail to timely file a required disclosure under these rules, substantial penalties
can apply. Potential investors should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any,
with respect to an investment in the Notes.

**_U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of interest, accruals of OID, if any, and proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of a Note may
be reported to the IRS unless the holder establishes a basis for exemption. Backup withholding may apply to amounts
subject to reporting if the holder fails to timely provide an accurate taxpayer identification number, fails to report all interest
and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal income tax returns, or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable
requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. A holder can claim a credit
against its U.S. federal income tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding and a refund of any excess provided
the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain owners of “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000 (and in some
circumstances, a higher threshold), will generally be required to file an information report on IRS Form 8938 with respect
to such assets with their U.S. federal tax returns. “Specified foreign financial assets” include any financial accounts
maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are held for investment and
not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non United States persons,
(ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign
entities. Such reporting requirement may also apply to certain non-individual holders. Holders are urged to consult their
tax advisors regarding the application of this reporting requirement to their ownership of Notes.

**_Medicare Tax_**

Certain U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be subject to
an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on some or all of such U.S. holder’s “net investment income”. Net investment income
generally includes interest on, and gain from the disposition of, the Notes unless such interest income or gain is derived in
the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or
trading activities). U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect this tax may have, if any, on their
acquisition, ownership or disposition of Notes.


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

**General**

Subject to the following discussion, the Notes may be acquired by an “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3)
of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), that is subject to Title I of ERISA,
a “plan” as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including individual retirement accounts) or an entity
deemed to hold “plan assets” within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA)
of the foregoing (each, a “Benefit Plan Investor”), as well as by “governmental plans” (as defined in Section 3(32) of
ERISA), “church plans” (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) or other plans that are subject to any applicable state, local
or other laws that are substantially similar to the fiduciary and/or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Law”) (collectively, with Benefit Plan Investors, referred to as “Plans”).

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit a Benefit Plan Investor from engaging in certain transactions
with persons that are “parties in interest” (as defined in Section 3 paragraph 14 of ERISA) or “disqualified persons” (as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to such Benefit Plan Investor unless an exemption is available. A violation
of these “prohibited transaction” rules may result in an excise tax or other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code for such persons or the fiduciaries of such Benefit Plan Investor. A Plan that is not a Benefit Plan Investor may be
subject to similar restrictions under Similar Law.

**General Fiduciary Matters**

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of a
Benefit Plan Investor or the management or disposition of the assets of such a Benefit Plan Investor, or who renders
investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Benefit Plan Investor, is generally considered to be a fiduciary
of the Benefit Plan Investor.

ERISA requires fiduciaries of a Benefit Plan Investor subject to ERISA to make investments that are prudent, diversified
and in accordance with the governing plan documents. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets
of any Plan, a fiduciary should consult with its counsel in order to determine the suitability of the Notes for such Plan,
including whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code
and any Similar Law.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the Guarantors or any of their respective
affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase
or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on
any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold
the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are
intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice
regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the
Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by or on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor could be considered to give rise to a
prohibited transaction if we or any other Transaction Party is or becomes, a party in interest or a disqualified person with
respect to such Benefit Plan Investor. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the
purchase and holding of the Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor depending on the type and circumstances of the plan fiduciary
making the decision to acquire the Notes and the relationship of the party in interest to the Benefit Plan Investor. Included
among these exemptions are: Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions
between a Benefit Plan Investor and non-fiduciary service providers to the Benefit Plan Investor; Prohibited Transaction
Class Exemption (“PTCE”) 96-23, regarding transactions effected by in-house asset managers; PTCE 95-60, regarding
investments by insurance company general accounts; PTCE 91-38, regarding investments by bank collective investment
funds; PTCE 90-1, regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; and PTCE 84-14, regarding
transactions effected by qualified professional asset managers. Even if the conditions specified in one or more of these
exemptions are met, the scope of the relief provided by these exemptions might or might not cover all acts which might be
construed as prohibited transactions. There can be no assurance that any of these, or any other exemption, will be available
with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, and prospective acquirers that are Benefit Plan Investors
should consult with their legal advisors regarding the applicability of any such exemption.


-----

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any Plan or person investing “plan assets” of any
Plan, unless such purchase and holding (i) are entitled to exemptive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar Law or (ii) would not otherwise constitute
a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any violation of applicable
Similar Law.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor should it be construed as legal
advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on
behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the suitability of an acquisition of the Notes
in light of such prospective purchaser’s particular circumstances, potential applicability of Title I of ERISA, Section 4975
of the Code and any Similar Law to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and
holding of the Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any of the Transaction Parties or their
respective representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any
such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any such Plan.

**Representation**

By acquiring a Note (or interest therein), each purchaser and transferee (and if the purchaser or transferee is a Plan, its
fiduciary) is deemed to represent, warrant and covenant that (A) either (i) it is not acquiring the Note (or interest therein)
with the assets of a Plan; or (ii) (x) the acquisition and holding of the Note (or interest therein) will not give rise to a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of Similar Law and
(y) none of the Transaction Parties is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the devision to purchase
or hold the Notes or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes and (B) it will not sell or otherwise transfer the Note (or interest
therein) other than to a purchaser or transferee that is deemed to make these same representations, warranties and covenants
with respect to its acquisition of the Note (or interest therein).


-----

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Notes will be represented by two global notes in bearer form, without interest coupons attached. One global note (the
“144A Global Note”) will represent Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A, and one global
note (the “Regulation S Global Note” and together with the 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”) will represent Notes
sold in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S.

Upon issuance, each of the Global Notes will be deposited with and immobilized, and held by Clearstream Banking AG,
Frankfurt am Main, Germany, (“Clearstream Banking”) and will be kept in custody by Clearstream Banking until all
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes have been satisfied. Definitive notes representing individual Notes and interest
coupons will not be issued.

All interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of Clearstream Banking. The Notes will
be transferable, subject to the limitations and procedures described below under “—Transfers”, by appropriate entries in
securities accounts in accordance with applicable rules of Clearstream Banking. The Notes will not be eligible for clearance
through the facilities of the Depositary Trust Company.

Pursuant to the Book-Entry Registration Agreement between the Issuer and Clearstream Banking, to be dated on or around
the Issue Date, the Issuer has appointed Clearstream Banking as its book-entry registrar (the “Book-Entry Registrar”) in
respect of the Notes, and agreed on an agent for the Issuer to maintain (i) a register reflecting the aggregate number of
Notes, represented by each Global Note in accordance with the Conditions of Issue and (ii) a register (the “Book-Entry
**Register”) containing records of the Notes credited to the accounts of the accountholders of Clearstream Banking, for the**
benefit of the Holders of the co-ownership interests (Miteigentumsanteile) in the Notes represented by the Global Notes.

The Issuer and Clearstream Banking have agreed, for the benefit of the Holders of co ownership interests in the Notes, that
the actual number of Notes, represented by each Global Note from time to time shall be evidenced by the records of the
Book-Entry Registrar. No transfer of any Note through the clearing system shall be effective unless it is recorded in the
Book-Entry Register. Ownership of interests in each Global Note will be limited to persons who have accounts with
Clearstream Banking (“participants”) or persons who hold interests through participants (“indirect participants”).

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Clearstream Banking will be effected in accordance with the applicable rules of
Clearstream Banking rules and, outside of the Federal Republic of Germany, of Clearstream Banking, (42 Avenue JF
Kennedy, 1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg) and Euroclear Bank SA/NV (Boulevard du Roi Albert II, 1210 Brussels,
Belgium) as operator of the Euroclear System and any successor in such capacity, and will be settled in immediately
available funds. The Notes will be transferable only in minimum aggregate principal amounts of €100,000 and any integral
multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer
_Restrictions”. Each Global Note and interests in each Global Note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described_
under “Transfer Restrictions” and “Plan of Distribution—Selling and Transfer Restrictions”.

The Notes represented by the 144A Global Note may be exchanged for Notes represented by the Regulation S Global Note
and vice versa, except that no such exchange can be effected in the period starting three business days prior to any payment
of principal, interest or any other amount under the Conditions of Issue until (and including) the date of such payment.

If a holder who holds a book-entry interest in the 144A Global Note wishes at any time to exchange its interest in the 144A
Global Note for an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, or to transfer its interest in the 144A Global Note to a person
who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in a Regulation S Global Note, it may, subject to the rules
and procedures of the clearing system and the requirements set forth in this paragraph, exchange or transfer or cause the
transfer of such interest for an equivalent interest in the Regulation S Global Note. Such exchange or transfer shall only be
made upon:

(a) receipt by the Transfer Agent of a certificate, in the form obtainable from the Transfer Agent, given by
such holder (i) instructing the Transfer Agent to credit or cause to be credited an interest in the
Regulation S Global Note in an amount equal to the interest in the 144A Global Note of the same series
to be exchanged or transferred, (ii) containing information regarding the account to be credited with such
increase and instructing the Transfer Agent to make arrangements to deliver such increase to such
account, and (iii) stating that the exchange or transfer of such interest has been made pursuant to and in
accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act; and


-----

(b) transfer of its interest in the 144A Global Note to be transferred or exchanged to the account of the
Transfer Agent with the clearing system designated by the Transfer Agent.

If a Holder who holds a book-entry interest in the Regulation S Global Note wishes at any time to exchange its interest in
the Regulation S Global Note for an interest in the 144A Global Note, or to transfer its interest in the Regulation S Global
Note to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in a 144A Global Note, it may, subject to
the rules and procedures of the clearing system and the requirements set forth in this paragraph, exchange or transfer or
cause the transfer of such interest for an equivalent interest in the 144A Global Note. Such exchange or transfer shall only
be made upon:

(a) receipt by the Transfer Agent of a certificate, in the form obtainable from the Transfer Agent, given by
such holder (i) instructing the Transfer Agent to credit or cause to be credited an interest in the 144A
Global Note in an amount equal to the interest in the Regulation S Global Note to be exchanged or
transferred, and (ii) containing information regarding the account to be credited with such increase and
instructing the Transfer Agent to make arrangements to deliver such increase to such account; and

(b) transfer of its interest in the Regulation S Global Note to be transferred or exchanged to the account of
the Transfer Agent with the Clearing System designated by the Transfer Agent.

Any exchange of Notes represented by the 144A Global Note for Notes, represented by the Regulation S Global Note, or
vice versa, shall be recorded on the register and shall be effected by an increase or a reduction in the aggregate amount
represented by the 144A Global Note by the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, so exchanged and a corresponding
reduction or increase in the aggregate principal amount of Notes represented by the Regulation S Global Note.

Pursuant to an agreement dated on or around the Issue Date between the Issuer and Clearstream Banking, the Issuer has
appointed Clearstream Banking as the Book-Entry Registrar. The Book-Entry Registrar has agreed to maintain the
Book-Entry Register, as agent of the Issuer, showing the interests of Clearstream Banking accountholders in the Global
Notes. No transfer of any Note through the clearing system shall be effective unless it is recorded in the Book-Entry
Register. On any redemption of, or payment of an installment on, or purchase and cancellation of, any of the Notes
represented by a Global Note the Issuer shall procure that details of any redemption, payment or purchase and cancellation
(as the case may be) in respect of that Global Note shall be entered accordingly in the register and, upon any such entry
being made, the principal amount of the Notes represented by the Global Notes shall be reduced by the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes so redeemed or purchased and cancelled or by the aggregate amount of such installment so paid and
appropriate entries shall be made in the Book-Entry Register by the Book-Entry Registrar.

**Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes**

The following summaries of those operations and procedures are provided herein solely for the convenience of investors.
The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at
any time. None of the Issuer, Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

The Issuer and the Guarantors understand the following with respect to Clearstream Banking:

- Clearstream Banking holds securities for participating organizations and facilitates the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of those
participants;

- Clearstream Banking provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration,
clearance and settlement of securities and securities lending and borrowing;

- Clearstream Banking participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations; and

- indirect access to Clearstream Banking is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust
companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Clearstream Banking participant, either
directly or indirectly.

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes will be made by the Issuer in euros to the
Paying Agent, which will pay such amounts to Clearstream Banking, as the holder of the Global Notes. Clearstream
Banking will, in turn, distribute those payments to its participants in accordance with its procedures. Payments by
participants and indirect participants of Clearstream Banking to the owners of interests in a Global Note will be the
responsibility of those participants or indirect participants.


-----

Investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications relating to the Notes
through Clearstream Banking on days when the Clearstream Banking system is open for business. That system may not be
open for business on certain days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States. In
addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications in connection with completing transactions through
Clearstream Banking on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer an interest in a
Global Note or to receive or make a payment or delivery of such an interest on a particular day may find that the transaction
will not be performed until the next business day in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

**ACTION BY OWNERS OF BOOK-ENTRY INTERESTS**

Clearstream Banking has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes only at
the direction of one or more participants to whose account the book-entry interests in the Global Notes are credited and
only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has
or have given such direction. Clearstream Banking will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or
the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes.

Book-entry interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements as
discussed in “Plan of Distribution—Selling and Transfer Restrictions”.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or_
_other transfer of the Notes offered hereby._

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act, or any state securities
laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable state securities laws. Accordingly,
the Notes are being offered and sold only (i) to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act) (“QIBs”) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) in offshore transactions (as defined in Regulation S) in reliance
on Regulation S.

The Issuer uses the terms “offshore transaction” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of the Notes hereunder (other than each of the Initial Purchasers) will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented and agreed with us, each Guarantor and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) It understands and acknowledges that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been registered under the
U.S. Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the Notes are being offered for resale
in transactions not requiring registration under the U.S. Securities Act or any other securities laws,
including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise
transferred except in compliance with the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or any other
applicable securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto
and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set out in paragraphs (5) and (6) below;

(2) It is neither the Issuer’s “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144), nor acting on its behalf and that either;

(a) it is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of these Notes to it will
be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for its own account or for the
account of another QIB; or

(b) it is purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S;

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer and its subsidiaries
or the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this offering memorandum,
which has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect
to the Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this offering
memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning the Issuer and its
subsidiaries and the Notes that it deems necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the
Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request information from, the Issuer and the
Initial Purchasers;

(4) It is purchasing the Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which it is acting
as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities
laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor
account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell
such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under
the U.S. Securities Act, or in any transaction not subject to the U.S. Securities Act;

(5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the Notes,
and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell
or otherwise transfer such Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is,
in the case of the Rule 144A Notes, one year after the latest of the original issue date of the Notes and
the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any predecessor
thereof), only (i) to the Issuer or the Guarantors; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been
declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for its own account or
for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A;
(iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in offshore transactions in
compliance with Regulation S; or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration

requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law
that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times
within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any applicable
local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer and the Holders’ Representative’s rights prior
to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) above to require the delivery of an opinion of
counsel, certification and other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing
cases, to require that a certificate of transfer is completed and delivered by the transferor to the Holders’
Representative. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction
Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN, AND WILL NOT BE, REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY
NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED,
TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE
OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT
SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.

IN THE CASE OF RULE 144A NOTES: THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY, BY ITS
ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT IS A “QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER” (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”)) OR
(B) IT IS ACQUIRING THIS NOTE IN AN “OFFSHORE TRANSACTION” PURSUANT TO
RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, AND (2) AGREES ON ITS
OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR FOR WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED
SECURITIES TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE
RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE, WHICH IS ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATEST OF
THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF, AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR
ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY
PREDECESSOR OF THIS SECURITY), ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER OR THE GUARANTORS,
(B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED
EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE
ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A, TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY
BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN
ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM
NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A,
(D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN
COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, OR (E) PURSUANT
TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT IN EACH OF THE FOREGOING CASES TO ANY
REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY
OF SUCH INVESTOR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR
CONTROL AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND
ANY APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE
ISSUER’S AND THE HOLDERS’ REPRESENTATIVE’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER,
SALE OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSES (D) OR (E) TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF
AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY
TO EACH OF THEM.

If the Notes are issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Notes will
bear the following legend:

ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT. THE NOTES HAVE BEEN ISSUED WITH ORIGINAL ISSUE
DISCOUNT (“OID”) FOR UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. IN SUCH
CASE, THE ISSUE PRICE, THE AMOUNT OF OID, THE ISSUE DATE AND THE YIELD TO
MATURITY MAY BE OBTAINED BY CONTACTING THE ISSUER AT PROGROUP AG, HEAD
OF TREASURY, HORSTRING 12, 76829 LANDAU, GERMANY

A purchaser of Notes will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to Holders
of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to Holders of these Notes.


-----

(6) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on the
transfer of such Notes;

(7) It acknowledges that the Book-Entry Registrar and Transfer Agent will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the
Issuer, Transfer Agent and the Book-Entry Registrar that the restrictions set out therein have been
complied with;

(8) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth
and accuracy of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any
of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by your
purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers.
If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it
has sole investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to
make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor
account; and

(9) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the Issuer,
the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the Notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the
Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any
transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set out under “Plan of Distribution”, “Notice
_to EEA Investors”, “Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors”, “Notice to UK Investors” and_
“Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors”.


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

**General**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, Erste Group Bank AG and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (the “Initial Purchasers”), and the Initial
Purchasers have agreed, subject to certain customary closing conditions, to subscribe to and pay for, the Notes on the Issue
Date.

The sale will be made pursuant to an agreement among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers (the “Purchase
**Agreement”). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial**
Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, to purchase from the Issuer all of the Notes. The Purchase Agreement
provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among
other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by the Issuer’s and their counsel. The Purchase Agreement also
provides that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make
in respect thereof. The Issuer has furthermore agreed to reimburse the Initial Purchasers for certain expenses incurred in
connection with the issue of the Notes. In the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have made certain
representations and given certain warranties in respect of their respective legal and financial matters. The Initial Purchasers
is entitled, under certain circumstances, to terminate the Purchase Agreement. In such event, no Notes will be delivered to
investors.

**No Sale of Similar Securities**

The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that it or its affiliates and subsidiaries will not, directly or
indirectly, sell or offer to sell any securites that are substantially similar to the Notes for a period of 90 days from the date
the Notes are issued without first obtaining the written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

**New Issue of Notes**

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made to The International
Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official
List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the
Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted, or that such listing will be
maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any time, without the consent of the Holders
or the Holders’ Representative, de-list the Notes from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of the
Notes to another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by
the European Union). The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completion
of the Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may discontinue any market-making
activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by
the U.S. Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, it cannot be assured that any market for the Notes will develop,
or that such market will be liquid if it does develop, or that an investor will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or
at a price which will be favorable.

**Stamp Tax**

Persons that purchase the Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in
accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, London Branch (the “Stabilizing Manager”) (or
persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These transactions may include over
allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids. Over allotment involves sales in excess
of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to
purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate
covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order
to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker/dealer
when the Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short
positions.

These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. These activities may stabilize, maintain or
otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise


-----

might exist in the open market. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the
direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition,
there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and neither the Issuer nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will engage in these transactions or that these transactions,
once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later than
the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes.

**Alternative Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefore on or around the date specified on the cover
page of this offering memorandum, which will be the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (this
settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+10”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary
market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.
Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days will
be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers
of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days should consult
their own advisor.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and/or certain of their respective affiliates have provided, currently provide and/or, from time to
time, may provide in the future, investment banking, commercial banking (including hedging transactions), lending,
guarantees, letters of credit, cash management, asset-backed securities programs, consulting, rating, and financial advisory
and /or other banking services to the Issuer and its affiliates for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction
fees, commissions and expense reimbursement. In particular, (i) the Issuer as company and original guarantor, Progroup
Paper PM3 GmbH as borrower and original guarantor, the other Guarantors as original guarantors and Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft as lender and agent, have entered into the Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities Agreement, (ii) the
Issuer as company, borrower and original guarantor, the Guarantors as original guarantors and Erste Group Bank AG as
lender and agent, have entered into the Senior Secured Erste Group Bank Facility Agreement, (iii) the Issuer as company,
borrower and original guarantor, the Guarantors as original guarantors and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg as lender and
agent, have entered into the Senior Secured LBBW Facilities Agreement, and (iv) the Initial Purchasers or certain of their
affiliates may be holders of the Existing Notes that will be redeemed at full by use of a portion of the proceeds from the
Offering. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or certain of their affiliates are arrangers and lenders under the Senior Secured
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, and such entities may act as counterparties under certain hedging arrangements into
which the Group has entered and expects to enter into in the future, and they will receive customary fees for their services
in such capacities. If the Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer and/or its
affiliates (e.g. under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), they may hedge their credit exposure
consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, they would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities,
including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect
future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments.

**Selling and Transfer Restrictions**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or qualified for sale
under the securities laws of any U.S. state or any jurisdiction outside the United States and may not be offered or sold
within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.
Accordingly, the Notes will be subject to significant restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to
_Investors”, “Notice to EEA Investors”, “Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors”, “Notice to UK Investors” and_
_Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions”. Any offer or sale of Notes in the United States in_
reliance on Rule 144A will be made by broker dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act.

The Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. The Initial Purchasers have advised
us that, following the completion of the Offering, they currently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so, and the Initial Purchasers may
discontinue any market making activities with respect to the Notes at any time in its sole discretion. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid and that you will be able to sell any
of the Notes held by you at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable to you. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—An active trading market may not develop for the Notes, in which case your
_ability to sell the Notes may be limited”. Each purchaser of the Notes, by its purchase of the Notes, will be deemed to have_


-----

made certain acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Notice to Investors”,
“Notice to EEA Investors” and “Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors”, “Notice to UK Investors”, “Prohibition of
_Sales to UK Retail Investors”._

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

  - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated
any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the United
Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) received by it in connection with the issuance
or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21 paragraph 1 of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer
or the Guarantors); and

  - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in
relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not
offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the purposes of this provision, the
expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following (i) a retail client as defined in point (11)
of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II, or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus
**Regulation”). The expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information**
on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the
Notes.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of
the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning
of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in
Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. The expression “offer”
includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes
to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Notes.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, by the Issuer
or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of
this offering memorandum or any other material relating to the Issuer or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this
purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this offering
memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or
published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any
such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to
purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering
memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the
distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to the Investors”, “Notice to EEA Investors”,
“Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors”, “Notice to UK Investors”, “Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors”
and “Transfer Restrictions”.

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or
disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of
Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.


-----

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany. Other Guarantors are incorporated in
Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. None of the directors, officers or other executives of the Issuer and
the Guarantors are residents or citizens of the United States. Therefore, you may be unable to effect service of process
within the United States on the directors, officers or executives. Furthermore, since the assets of the Issuer and each of the
Guarantors, and its and their respective directors and officers are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained
in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the
payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil
liabilities under U.S. Federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States.

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities
based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in
U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently,
a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court,
however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German
court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.
The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number of factors,
including the following:

  - the judgment being valid and final under U.S. federal or state law;

  - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

  - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served complaint;

  - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a recognized judgment of
a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court;

  - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the matter (Verfahren)
pending before a German court, provided that such German matter was pending before a German court prior to
the U.S. court entered its judgment;

  - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial foundations of German
law, in particular with the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution
(Grundgesetz); and

  - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters
obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments
in Germany will be successful. Enforcement is also subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, liquidation, moratorium as well as other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts as
incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual
losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the
production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common
law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production
of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive
in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

We have been advised by French, Czech, Polish and English counsel that similar risks related to enforcing judgments from
a U.S. federal or state court exist in such jurisdictions, and we cannot assure you that such risks do not and will not exist
in other jurisdictions, including those in which the assets of some or all of our subsidiaries that may guarantee the Notes in
the future are located.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

Certain legal matters in connection with the Offering will be passed upon for us by Mayer Brown LLP and Rittershaus
Rechtsanwälte Partnerschaftsgesellschaft mbB, as to matters of German law, and by Mayer Brown International LLP as to
matters of U.S. federal law. Certain legal matters in connection with the Offering will be passed upon for the Initial
Purchasers by Latham & Watkins LLP, as to matters of German and U.S. federal law.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, which
were prepared on the basis of German GAAP and are included in this offering memorandum, have been audited in
accordance with Section 317 HGB (German Commercial Code) and German generally accepted standards for the audit of
financial statements promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in
_Deutschland e.V.) by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”), independent auditors, as_
stated in their independent auditor’s reports appearing herein, which is a member of the German Chamber of Public
Accountants (Wirtschaftsprüferkammer), Berlin. The auditor’s adress is PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Glücksteinallee 43-45, 68163 Mannheim, Germany. Each of the respective independent
auditor’s reports of PwC on the consolidated financial statements refers to the respective group management report of
Progroup AG. The group management reports as a whole are not included or incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum. They were prepared by and are the sole responsibility of, the Company's management in accordance with
German generally accepted accounting principles. The examinations of, and the auditor’s reports upon, such group
management reports are required and were performed in accordance with Section 317 of the German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and German generally accepted standards for the audit of management reports promulgated by
the German Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Those examinations were not made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing or attestation standards in the United States. Accordingly, PwC does not express any opinion on this
information or on the consolidated financial statements included in this offering memorandum, in each case in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted auditing standards or U.S. attestation standards. The information contained in such group
management reports and the auditor's reports upon such group management reports should not be relied upon by U.S.
investors.

**AVAILABLE INFORMATION**

Each purchaser of the Notes from the Initial Purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this offering memorandum and
any amendments or supplements to this offering memorandum. Each person receiving this offering memorandum and any

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2023**

**A.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

The consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, comprising the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated
income statement, notes to the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated cash flow statement and the
consolidated statement of changes in equity, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Parts One and Two of the Third Book of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB—German Commercial Code) and the
supplementary provisions of the Aktiengesetz (AktG—German Stock Corporation Act). The previous year's
figures are stated for comparative purposes.

In the interest of greater clarity and transparency, below-the-line items to be reported for consolidated balance
sheet or consolidated income statement line items pursuant to the statutory provisions, as well as disclosures and
below-the-line items which may be reported either in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income
statement or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have all been reported in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

Insofar as individual consolidated balance sheet items and/or consolidated income statement items have been
combined as part of the statutory regulations so as to provide better transparency, the composition of these line
items is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

The presentation and the previous year’s figures of deferred taxes were adjusted in the reporting year. For more
details, please refer to Section F.

**B.** **SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS**

**I.** **Investments in a new Progroup Board plant in Germany**

Construction work for the future PW15 corrugated sheetboard plant in Petersberg/Höheischweiler (RhinelandPalatinate) were continued successfully in the financial year 2023. The new site is scheduled to start production in
August 2024. The state-of-the-art production facility is being constructed directly next to the plant of packaging
manufacturer G&G Preißer. The cooperation between the two companies will create a new packaging park on the
site, in which the neighbouring packaging manufacturer will be supplied just-in-time with corrugated sheet board
via a direct connection. The line item “Prepayments and construction in process” reported for Progroup Board
GmbH includes an amount of approximately €94.3 mn resulting from construction activities in relation to PW15.

**II.** **Investments in a new Progroup Power 2 plant**

In the financial year 2023, construction work for the future waste-to-energy power plant in Sandersdorf-Brehna
(Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) was continued successfully. The new site is scheduled to start production in the
summer of 2025. The new power plant is being constructed directly next to the paper mill of Progroup Paper PM3
GmbH. The share in the balance sheet item “Prepayments and construction in process” amounts to around €73.0
mn.

**III.** **Start of production for the new Progroup Board plant in Poland**

Construction in process, capitalised at Progroup Board Sp.z.o.o. in the amount of €76.6 mn as at 31 December
2022, which mainly resulted from the PW14 plant in Stryków, Poland, was reclassified to the corresponding asset
categories in January 2023; this was also the start of depreciation for the related assets. Production was successfully
started in early 2023.

F-13


-----

**IV.** **Investments in a new Progroup Board plant in Italy**

Construction work for the future PW16 corrugated sheetboard plant in Cessalto/Treiso (Veneto) was started in the
financial year 2023. Operations at the new plant are expected to commence in the second half of the financial year
2025. The line item “Prepayments and construction in process” reported for Progroup Board S.r.l. includes an
amount of approximately €26.4 mn resulting from construction activities in relation to PW16.

**V.** **Use of prior year net retained profits**

On 14 June 2023, the general meeting of shareholders resolved to distribute to the shareholders from the net
retained profits reported in the annual financial statements of Progroup AG for the 2022 financial year in the
amount of €519,147,110.55 a dividend of €0.66 (gross) per share entitled to dividends, i. e. a total amount of
€5,008,235.76 (gross), and to carry forward to new account the remaining net retained profits of €514,138,874.79.

**C.** **BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION**

The subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are presented in section F. III. 3 to 5 of the notes
to the consolidated financial statements.

In 2023, Progroup Paper PM4 GmbH was included for the first time in Progroup AG’s group of consolidated
companies.

**D.** **PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION**

Acquisitions made until 31 December 2009 continue to be accounted for in accordance with section 66(3) of the
Einführungsgesetz zum Handelsgesetzbuch (EGHGB—Introductory Act to the German Commercial Code), using
the carrying amount method under section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB (former version) by eliminating the cost of the
equity investments against the proportionate amount that these shares represent in the equity of the subsidiaries.

Acquisitions made after 31 December 2009 are accounted for in accordance with section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB
(as amended) using the purchase method. With this method, the acquisition cost of the investments is eliminated
against the equity reflecting the fair value of the assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred income as well
as special items to be included in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.

Receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies have been eliminated, with receivables and liabilities
of €886,925 thousand being eliminated outside profit or loss.

In the financial year 2023, intercompany profits from paper deliveries of Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup
Paper PM2 GmbH and Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH to affiliated companies decreased by €5,931 thousand.
Intragroup sales, intragroup other operating income and interest income have been eliminated against
corresponding expenses, with expenses and income of €847,579 thousand having been eliminated.

Deferred taxes are generally recognised for first-time consolidation adjustments recognised outside profit or loss
as well as for consolidation adjustments recognised through profit or loss. In 2023, consolidation adjustments
recognised through profit or loss related exclusively to the elimination of intercompany profits. Deferred tax assets
of €222 thousand (previous year: €1,991 thousand) were recognised on eliminated intercompany profits of €744
thousand (previous year: €6,675 thousand).

**E.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**I.** **Disclosure of accounting policies applied**

**Intangible assets are measured at cost less amortisation. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over**
the standard useful lives. The intangible assets are amortised over a useful life of 3–10 years. To the extent that
the fair values of individual intangible fixed assets fall below their carrying amounts, additional impairment losses
are recorded in case of an expected permanent impairment.

**Tangible fixed assets are measured at purchase and production cost less depreciation. Depreciation on additions**
to tangible fixed assets is generally recorded pro rata temporis. To the extent that the fair values of individual
assets fall below their carrying amounts, additional impairment losses are recorded in case of an expected
permanent impairment.

F-14


-----

The purchase costs comprise expenses incurred to acquire an asset and to bring it to its working condition to the
extent that such costs can be allocated individually to such asset. Production cost comprises, if applicable, direct
material costs, direct labour costs and special costs of production, appropriate and necessary indirect material costs
and indirect labour costs, general and administrative costs and expenses for social amenities, for voluntary social
benefits and for occupational pensions. Borrowing costs have also been included in production cost to the extent
that they were attributable to the period of production.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the standard useful lives. Buildings are depreciated over a
useful life of 33 years, technical equipment and machinery over a useful life of 3–25 years, and other equipment,
factory and office equipment over a useful life of 3–8 years.

Prepayments made are presented in the balance sheet at their nominal amount.

**Financial assets are measured at cost or, in the event of an expected permanent impairment, at their lower fair**
value as at the balance sheet date.

**Investment grants are reported separately at their nominal amount on the liability side under the special item**
“Investment grants for fixed assets” and are reversed in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for
which the grants were awarded.

Low-value assets costing up to €250.00 each are fully written off in the year of acquisition. Assets which are
capable of being used independently and which cost between €250.00 and €1,000.00 are posted to a collective
item in the year of acquisition; this collective item is reversed as a charge to profit or loss over 5 years.

**Inventories** are measured at cost, taking account of the lower of cost or market value. Appropriate valuation
allowances are recorded for any identifiable risks resulting from above-average storage periods, reduced
recoverability and/or lower replacement costs. In all cases, fair value measurement was applied, i. e. write-downs
are recognised to the extent that the expected selling prices less costs incurred prior to disposal result in a lower
fair value.

**Raw materials, consumables and supplies are measured at actual cost or, taking account of the principle of lower**
of cost or market value, at lower market values as at the reporting date. Replacement parts for machines are also
recognised under raw materials, consumables and supplies. Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to
inventories which are obsolete, second-hand, damaged or slow-moving. Lump-sum valuation allowances
amounting to €10,951 thousand (previous year: €11,016 thousand) were applied to replacement parts which are
obsolete, second-hand or slow-moving.

**Work in process and finished goods are measured at production cost. Production cost comprises, if applicable,**
direct material costs, direct labour costs and special costs of production, appropriate and necessary indirect material
costs, indirect labour costs, depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets that is attributable to the production
process and general and administrative costs and costs of occupational pensions. Borrowing costs are not included
in production cost.

**Receivables and other assets are recognised at their principal amount or at their lower fair value as at the balance**
sheet date.

Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to receivables whose recoverability is associated with identifiable
risks; irrecoverable receivables are written off in full.

To cover the general risk from trade receivables, a global valuation allowance of 1% is recognised on domestic
and foreign receivables (net of value added tax) which are not subject to a specific valuation allowance.

**Securities held as current assets are recognised at cost or at their lower fair value as at the balance sheet date.**

**Cash in hand and bank balances are measured at their nominal amounts.**

Payments before the balance sheet date are recognised as prepaid expenses to the extent that they represent an
expense for a specific period of time after this date.

The measurement of the **excess of plan assets over post-employment benefit liability is determined as the**
residual amount from offsetting plan assets measured at fair value against the amount of the liabilities from post
F-15


-----

employment benefit obligations or comparable long-term obligations.

**Subscribed capital is recognised at its calculated amount.**

**Provisions are recognised at the settlement amount dictated by prudent business judgement. Provisions are**
recognised for liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount as well as for losses from onerous contracts. All risks
arising up to the balance sheet date and identifiable up to the date of the preparation of the financial statements
have been taken into account. Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year have to be discounted using
the average market interest rate of the last seven years applicable for their remaining term, while pension provisions
are discounted using the average market interest rate of the past ten years.

**Liabilities are carried at their settlement amount.**

Payments received before the reporting date are recognised as deferred income to the extent that they represent
income for a specific time period after this date.

To determine deferred taxes based on temporary or quasi-permanent differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts for assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges, and deferred income and their tax
bases, or based on tax loss carryforwards, the amounts of the resulting tax liability and benefit were measured at
the individual companies’ tax rates at the point in time when the differences are reversed; they were not discounted.
For further information, please refer to Section F.

In 2023, the Minimum Tax Act (MinStG) was passed in Germany to implement the Council Directive (EU)
2022/25234 on ensuring a global minimum level of taxation based on the OECD’s Pillar Two Model. According
to the current status of the analyses regarding the potential impact of the Pillar Two rules on the companies of the
Progroup Group, the national top-up tax will, in principle, not result in any additional tax burden for Progroup in
the future, as the company is neither the ultimate parent entity nor the group head (Gruppenträgerin) of the
minimum tax group (Mindeststeuergruppe) within the meaning of section 3 of the MinStG. Progroup therefore
assumes that the first-time application of the regulations on global minimum taxation (Pillar Two rules) for the
2024 financial year will not have any material impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations.

**II.** **Currency translation disclosures**

Receivables, other assets, cash and cash equivalents, provisions and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated during the year into euros. Measurement as at the balance sheet date is at the average spot exchange
rate on 31 December 2023, with the principle of lower of cost or market value, or higher settlement amount, as
appropriate, being taken into account for receivables and liabilities with a maturity of over one year in accordance
with section 256a of the HGB.

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from currency translation are recognised in other operating income or
expenses.

Translation of foreign subsidiary annual financial statements is carried out using the modified closing rate method
in accordance with section 308a HGB.

Currency translation differences from the consolidation of intercompany balances are recognised directly in
currency translation adjustments in equity.

**F.** **DISCLOSURES AND EXPLANATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS IN THE**
**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT**

The financial year of all companies included in the consolidated financial statements corresponds to the calendar
year.

**I.** **Consolidated balance sheet**

**1.** **Fixed assets**

In connection with the acquisition of Progroup Power 1 GmbH in 2015 and related revaluation of acquired fixed
assets in correspondence with the capital consolidation, an operating license at acquisition cost of €23,894
thousand was acquired. Subsequently, the operating license has been amortised since 2015 over a remaining useful

F-16


-----

life of 10 years. As at the balance sheet date, the residual carrying amount is €4,814 thousand with a remaining
term of 2 years.

The classification and movement in the financial year of the fixed asset accounts recognised in the consolidated
financial statements are separately presented as an appendix to the notes to the financial statements in the fixed
asset movement schedule.

The value of prepayments and construction in process as at 31 December 2023 is €239.5 mn (previous year: €164.5
mn) and primarily results from the Progroup Board plant in Petersberg (Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) in the
amount of €94.3 mn (previous year: €29.7 mn), the waste-to-energy plant currently built in Sandersdorf-Brehna in
the amount of €73.0 mn (previous year: €9.6 mn) and the Progroup Board plant currently under construction in
Cessalto (Italy) in the amount of €26.4 mn (previous year: €9.5 mn).

In the previous year, the new Progroup Board plant PW14 in Stryków (Poland) in the amount of €76.6 mn was
included in the line item “Prepayments and work in process”; the plant started production in January 2023.

**2.** **Receivables and other assets**

As in the previous year, receivables and other assets do not include receivables due in more than one year.

Receivables from affiliated companies of €632 thousand (previous year: €30 thousand) include receivables from
shareholders in the amount of €632 thousand (previous year: €18 thousand). As in the previous year, the full
amount of receivables from affiliated companies and receivables from shareholders refers to sales and services.

Furthermore, other assets include input tax refund claims in an amount of €117 thousand (previous year: €112
thousand), which in accordance with tax law provisions will arise only after the balance sheet date.

**3.** **Securities held as current assets**

The line item “Securities” includes own bonds repurchased at a nominal amount of €32 mn; the related carrying
amount as at 31 December 2023 is €28.360 thousand.

**4.** **Prepaid expenses and deferred charges**

Prepaid expenses and deferred charges for the financial year total €4,415 thousand (previous year: €7,131
thousand).

As a result of the pledging of shares of the shareholders, these shareholders were granted a liability compensation.
This liability compensation is reported as prepaid expenses in the financial statements of Progroup AG and is
reversed rateably over the term of the financings. The amount deferred as at the reporting date amounts to €3,676
thousand (previous year: €6,024 thousand).

**5.** **Subscribed capital**

The share capital of the parent company is €7,588,236.00 and is divided into 7,588,236 no-par value shares with
a calculated amount of subscribed capital of one euro each.

Distribution potential is based on the annual financial statements of Progroup AG. The articles of association do
not contain any restrictions on distributions. There is a restriction on distributions pursuant to section 253(6) of
the HGB in connection with the measurement of pension obligations in the amount of €19 thousand (previous
year: €72 thousand).

**6.** **Investment grants for fixed assets**

Investment grants as well as redemption subsidies for fixed assets are reported as a special reserve and are reversed
on a pro rata basis in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for which the grants were awarded.

**7.** **Pension provisions**

Pension provisions are measured in accordance with the PUC method (projected unit credit) using Prof. Dr. Klaus

F-17


-----

Heubeck’s 2018 G mortality tables. The provisions were discounted at the market interest rate of the preceding ten
years published by Deutsche Bundesbank (10-year average interest rate) assuming that all liabilities have a
remaining maturity of 15 years (section 253(2) sent. 2 of the HGB).

Reinsurance policies entered into to finance pension claims were recorded using matching measurement bases.
Accordingly, so-called “matching components” of the obligation and the reinsurance cover are recognised, in
principle, at identical amounts on both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet. If the amount of the
liability item is used as the measurement basis for the matching component, recognition is based on the required
settlement amount in accordance with section 253 of the HGB.

Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions:

   - Pension increase: + 2.00% (unchanged from 2022)

   - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2022)

   - Interest rate (10-year average): 1.82% (previous year: 1.78%)

   - Interest rate (7-year average): 1.72% (previous year: 1.43%)

Pension obligations for which provisions are required to be recognised amounted to €1,542 thousand as at the
balance sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve exclusively to settle
liabilities from post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment by third parties (so-called
plan assets). A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan asset. Plan assets that serve a
specific purpose, have been pledged and are protected against insolvency were measured at the asset value based
on information from the insurer as at 31 December 2023 at the asset value (€1,597 thousand; this corresponds to
the fair value). The balance remaining after offsetting against the carrying amount of the pension provision (€55
thousand) is reported on the assets side under “Excess of plan assets over post-employment benefit liability”. Effect
on profit in 2023:

   - Interest expense from pension provision: €29 thousand (previous year: €31 thousand)

   - Interest income from plan assets: €31 thousand (previous year: €33 thousand)

The balance of interest expenses from the measurement of the pension provision (including the effect from changes
in interest) and interest income from the measurement of the plan assets was reported in the financial result. For
the financial year, the balance between the measurement of the pension provision with the 7-year average interest
rate and the 10-year average interest rate amounts to €19 thousand and is subject to a distribution restriction.

In addition, there are pension obligations within Progroup Board S.A.S, Douvrin, France, in the amount of
approximately €180 thousand as at the balance sheet date.

________________________________________
*) The previous year’s figures were adjusted.

To determine deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for
assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges and deferred income, and their tax bases, or based on tax
loss carryforwards and interest carried forward, the amounts of the resulting tax liability and benefit were measured

F-20


-----

at the individual companies’ tax rates (19% – 29.83%) at the point in time when the differences are reversed; they
were not discounted. Deferred tax assets relating to loss carryforwards were taken into account if it was probable
that the loss would be offset within the next five years. Today’s assessment may change in accordance with the
companies’ income positions and tax legislation in future years and may require to be adjusted. In addition,
deferred tax assets were recognised in the financial year 2023 on consolidation adjustments for the elimination of
intercompany profits in accordance with section 306 HGB as well as deferred tax liabilities from initial
consolidation of Progroup Power 1 GmbH acquired in 2015.

Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards of €9,262 thousand (previous year: €6,516 thousand) were fully
recognised because the underlying tax planning confirms that the amounts recognised can actually be utilised to
reduce tax liabilities in the next 5 years, or a net deferred tax liability exists as at the balance sheet date. Eligible
interest carried forward from the German earnings stripping rule or from other comparable rules in foreign
countries did not exist as at the balance sheet date.

In the year under review, deferred tax assets and liabilities were reported net, to the extent permitted in compliance
with the offsetting rules applicable in the various jurisdictions, in the amount of €12,301 thousand. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are only netted if there is a legally enforceable right to off-set the current tax assets against
tax liabilities and the deferred tax balances relate to the same tax au-thority. Full netting was applied for the
consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022, regardless of the offsetting rules. In the consolidated
financial statements as at 31 December 2023, the presentation as at 31 December 2022 was adjusted.

**II.** **Consolidated income statement**

**III.** **Other disclosures**

**1.** **Contingent liabilities, off-balance sheet transactions and other financial commitments**

The note outstanding on the balance sheet date and the Revolving Credit Facility, which can also be utilised by
subsidiaries of Progroup AG, as well as of all bank loans existing within the Progroup Group are secured by
pledging all shares in Progroup AG and the company shares in its main subsidiaries, by pledging the bank deposits
of the parent company, by assigning tangible fixed assets of the subsidiaries and by granting real estate liens.
Furthermore, certain covenants apply with regard to the loans and/or bonds.

The notes, the Revolving Credit Facility as well as any bank loans of the Progroup Group are secured pari passu
as mentioned above. However, in an Intercreditor Agreement, the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility
were granted priority satisfaction from possible proceeds of sale.

Furthermore, the parent company has provided letters of comfort and guarantees for a total amount of €52,653
thousand (previous year: €55,748 thousand) to various suppliers of subsidiaries. The parent company also has
assumed joint and several co-liability vis-à-vis CommerzFactoring GmbH for obligations of Progroup
Board GmbH from a forfaiting framework agreement.

The risk of enforcement should be regarded as low as none of the affiliates have a strained liquidity position.

The companies lease forklifts and trucks under operating lease agreements so that these assets are not recognised
in the companies’ financial statements. As at 31 December 2023, the remaining obligations from the lease
agreements for forklifts, trucks and passenger cars of Progroup AG for the following years amounted to €14,626
thousand (previous year: €21,822 thousand). In addition, there were rental and lease agreements for movable assets
as well as for the rental of factory buildings and space as at the balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2023, the
remaining obligations from these rental/lease agreements for subsequent years were €9,024 thousand (previous
year: €11,373 thousand) (nominal amount). The advantage of these agreements is that a lower amount of capital
is tied up in the beginning than compared to a purchase and there is an absence of realisation risk. Risks could
arise from the lease agreement periods if the assets can no longer be fully utilised, although there are currently no
indications of this.

As at the balance sheet date, there were gas and electricity supply contracts in place for the reliable supply of
energy at fixed prices which did not lead, however, to a recognition. These contracts have remaining terms until
31 December 2025.

Due to specific contractual agreements entered into as at the balance sheet date, total obligations from energy
supply contracts for the following year 2024 amount to €66,825 thousand (previous year: €159,153 thousand).

In addition, as at the balance sheet date, there were contractual purchase commitments for waste paper and
corrugated board base paper supplies; respective commitments amount to €23,654 thousand (previous year:
€47,854 thousand). Furthermore, there are outstanding purchase commitments for other services in the amount of
€194,872 thousand (previous year: €53,028 thousand).

The following independent auditor's report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) has been issued in

statements and group management report of Progroup AG, as of and for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. The

German-language documents.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To Progroup AG, Offenbach an der Queich

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, Offenbach an der Queich, and its subsidiaries (the
Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated income statement,
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year from 1 January to
31 December 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the presentation of the recognition and
measurement policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Progroup AG for the financial year
from 1 January to 31 December 2023.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

   - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of
German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group
as at 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December
2023 in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, and

   - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In
all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements,
complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future
development.

Pursuant to § [Article] 322 Abs. [paragraph] 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code],
we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial
statements and of the group management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with
§ 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those
requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated
Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report“ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the
group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements
and on the group management report.

_Other Information_

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The publication “Annual Report 2023” is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other
information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

   - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report
disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

F-29


-----

   - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the_
_Group Management Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all
material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the consolidated financial statements give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal
control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable
the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e.,
fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided
no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole,
provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as
they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the
applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the
group management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides
an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial
statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately
presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317
HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

   - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of
arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion
on the effectiveness of these systems.

   - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of
estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

   - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that

F-30


-----

may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as
a going concern.

   - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting
Principles.

   - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group
management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We
remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

   - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

   - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper
derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on
the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that
future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our
audit.

**D.** **PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION**

Acquisitions made until 31 December 2009 continue to be accounted for in accordance with section 66(3) of the
Einführungsgesetz zum Handelsgesetzbuch (EGHGB—Introductory Act to the German Commercial Code), using the
carrying amount method under section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB (former version) by eliminating the cost of the equity
investments against the proportionate amount that these shares represent in the equity of the subsidiaries.

Acquisitions made after 31 December 2009 are accounted for in accordance with section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB (as
amended) using the purchase method. With this method, the acquisition cost of the investments is eliminated against the
equity reflecting the fair value of the assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred income as well as special items to be
included in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
Receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies have been eliminated, with receivables and liabilities of
€1,623,466 thousand being eliminated outside profit or loss.

In the financial year 2022, intercompany profits from Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH’s, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH’s and
Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH’s paper deliveries to affiliated companies increased to €1,398 thousand; they were eliminated
through profit or loss. Intragroup sales, intragroup other operating income and interest income have been eliminated against
corresponding expenses, with expenses and income of €1,005,092 thousand having been eliminated.

Deferred taxes are generally recognised for first-time consolidation adjustments recognised outside profit or loss as well as
for consolidation adjustments recognised through profit or loss. In 2022, consolidation adjustments recognised through
profit or loss related exclusively to the elimination of intercompany profits. Deferred tax assets of €1,991 thousand
(previous year: €1,574 thousand) were recognised on eliminated intercompany profits of €6,675 thousand (previous year:
€5,277 thousand).

**E.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**I.** **Disclosure of accounting policies applied**

**Intangible assets are measured at cost less amortisation. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the**
standard useful lives. The intangible assets are amortised over a useful life of 3 to 10 years. To the extent that the fair values
of individual intangible fixed assets fall below their carrying amounts, additional impairment losses are recorded in case
of an expected permanent impairment.

**Tangible fixed assets are measured at purchase and production cost less depreciation. Depreciation on additions to tangible**
fixed assets is generally recorded pro rata temporis. To the extent that the fair values of individual assets fall below their
carrying amounts, additional impairment losses are recorded in case of an expected permanent impairment.

The purchase costs comprise expenses incurred to acquire an asset and to bring it to its working condition to the extent that
such costs can be allocated individually to such asset. Production cost comprises, if applicable, direct material costs, direct
labour costs and special costs of production, appropriate and necessary indirect material costs and indirect labour costs,
general and administrative costs and expenses for social amenities, for voluntary social benefits and for occupational
pensions. Borrowing costs have also been included in production cost to the extent that they were attributable to the period
of production.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the standard useful lives. Buildings are depreciated over a useful
life of 33 years, technical equipment and machinery over a useful life of 10–17 years, and other equipment, factory and
office equipment over a useful life of 3–8 years.

Prepayments made are presented in the balance sheet at their nominal amount.

**Financial assets are measured at cost or, in the event of an expected permanent impairment, at their lower fair value as at**
the balance sheet date.

F-44


-----

**Investment grants are reported separately at their nominal amount on the liabilities side under the special item “Investment**
grants for fixed assets” and are reversed in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for which the grants were
awarded.

Low-value assets costing up to €250.00 each are fully written off in the year of acquisition. Assets which are capable of
being used independently and which cost between €250.00 and €1,000.00 are posted to a collective item in the year of
acquisition; this collective item is reversed as a change to profit or loss over 5 years.

**Inventories are measured at cost, taking account of the lower of cost or market value. Appropriate valuation allowances**
are recorded for any identifiable risks resulting from above-average storage periods, reduced recoverability and/or lower
replacement costs. In all cases, fair value measurement was applied, i. e. write-downs are recognised to the extent that the
expected selling prices less costs incurred prior to disposal result in a lower fair value.

**Raw materials, consumables and supplies are measured at actual cost or, taking account of the principle of lower of cost**
or market value, at lower market values as at the reporting date. Replacement parts for machines are also recognised under
raw materials, consumables and supplies. Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to inventories which are obsolete,
second-hand, damaged or slow-moving. Lump-sum valuation allowances amounting to €11,016 thousand (previous year:
€8,394 thousand) were applied to replacement parts which are obsolete, second-hand or slow-moving.

**Work in process and finished goods are measured at production cost. Production cost comprises, if applicable, direct**
material costs, direct labour costs and special costs of production, appropriate and necessary indirect material costs, indirect
labour costs, depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets that is attributable to the production process and general and
administrative costs and costs of occupational pensions. Borrowing costs are not included in production cost.

**Receivables and other assets are recognised at their principal amount or at their lower fair value as at the balance sheet**
date.

Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to receivables whose recoverability is associated with identifiable risks;
irrecoverable receivables are written off in full.

To cover the general risk from trade receivables, a global valuation allowance of 1% is recognised on domestic and foreign
receivables (net of value added tax) which are not subject to a specific valuation allowance.

**Securities held as current assets are recognised at cost or at their lower fair value as at the balance sheet date.**

**Cash in hand and bank balances are measured at their nominal amounts.**

Payments before the balance sheet date are recognised as prepaid expenses to the extent that they represent an expense
for a specific period of time after this date.

The excess of plan assets over post-employment benefit liability is measured at nominal value.

**Subscribed capital is recognised at its calculated amount.**

**Provisions are recognised at the settlement amount dictated by prudent business judgement. Provisions are recognised for**
liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount as well as for losses from onerous contracts. All risks arising up to the balance
sheet date and identifiable up to the date of the preparation of the financial statements have been taken into account.
Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year have to be discounted using the average market interest rate of the
last seven years applicable for their remaining term, while pension provisions are discounted using the average market
interest rate of the past ten years.

**Liabilities are carried at their settlement amount.**

Payments received before the reporting date are recognised as deferred income to the extent that they represent income
for a specific time period after this date.

**Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at their calculated amount. For further explanations, please refer to Chapter F.**

**II.** **Changes in accounting policies applied**

In the financial year 2022, after an analysis of the expense accounts, production-related maintenance expenses in the
amount of €2,721 thousand were reclassified from other operating expenses to costs

-----

of materials (comparative period 1 January – 31 December 2021: €935 thousand).

**III.** **Currency translation disclosures**

Receivables, other assets, cash and cash equivalents and provisions and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated during the year into euros. Measurement as at the balance sheet date is at the average spot exchange rate on 31
December 2022, with the principle of lower of cost or market value, or higher settlement amount, as appropriate, being
taken into account for receivables and liabilities with a maturity of over one year in accordance with section 256a of the
HGB.

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from currency translation are recognised in other operating income or expenses.

Translation of foreign subsidiary annual financial statements is carried out using the modified closing rate method in
accordance with section 308a HGB.

Currency translation differences from the consolidation of intercompany balances are recognised directly in currency
translation adjustments in equity.

**F.** **DISCLOSURES AND EXPLANATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED**
**BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT**

The financial year of all companies included in the consolidated financial statements corresponds to the calendar year.

**I.** **Consolidated balance sheet**

**1.** **Fixed assets**

In connection with the acquisition of Progroup Power 1 GmbH in 2015 and related revaluation of acquired fixed assets in
correspondence with the capital consolidation, an operating license at acquisition cost of €23,894 thousand has been
acquired. Subsequently, the operating license has been amortised since 2015 over a remaining useful life of 10 years. As
at the balance sheet date, the residual carrying amount is €7,221 thousand with a remaining term of 3 years.

The classification and movement in the financial year of the fixed asset accounts recognised in the consolidated financial
statements are separately presented as an appendix to the notes to the financial statements in the fixed asset movement
schedule.

The value of construction in process as at 31 December 2022 is €164.5 mn (previous year: €74.7 mn), mainly resulting
from the Progroup Board plant in Strykow, Poland, as well as the Progroup Board plant in Petersberg (RhinelandPalatinate), Germany.

The line item “Prepayments and construction in process” includes disposals in the amount of €18.2 mn as at the balance
sheet date. An amount of €16.6 mn is attributable to the Italian subsidiary and results from the reclassification in the balance
sheet from fixed assets to current assets.

**2.** **Receivables and other assets**

As in the previous year, receivables and other assets do not include receivables due in more than one year.

Receivables from affiliated companies of €30 thousand (previous year: €12 thousand) include receivables from
shareholders in the amount of €18 thousand (previous year: €12 thousand). As in the previous year, the full amount of
receivables from affiliated companies and receivables from shareholders refers to sales and services.

Furthermore, other assets include input tax refund claims in an amount of €112 thousand (previous year: €268 thousand),
which in accordance with tax law provisions come into existence only after the balance sheet date.

**3.** **Securities held as current assets**

The line item “Securities” includes repurchased own bonds in a nominal amount of €32 mn; the related carrying amount
as at 31 December 2022 is €27,432 thousand.

F-46


-----

**4.** **Prepaid expenses and deferred charges**

Prepaid expenses and deferred charges for the financial year total €7,131 thousand (previous year: €10,200 thousand).

As a result of the pledging of shares of the shareholders, these shareholders were granted a liability compensation. This
liability compensation is reported as prepaid expenses in the financial statements of Progroup AG and is reversed rateably
over the term of the financings. The amount deferred as at the reporting date amounts to €6,024 thousand (previous year:
€8,645 thousand).

**5.** **Subscribed capital**

The share capital of the parent company is €7,588,236.00 and is divided into 7,588,236 no-par value shares with a calculated
amount of subscribed capital of one euro each.

Distribution potential is based on the annual financial statements of Progroup AG. The articles of association do not contain
any restrictions on distributions. There is a restriction on distributions pursuant to section 253(6) of the HGB in connection
with the measurement of pension obligations in the amount of €72 thousand (previous year: €119 thousand).

**6.** **Investment grants for fixed assets**

Investment grants as well as redemption subsidies for fixed assets are reported as a special reserve and are reversed on a
pro rata basis in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for which the grants were awarded.

**7.** **Pension provisions**

Pension provisions are measured in accordance with the PUC method (projected unit credit) using Prof. Dr. Klaus
Heubeck’s 2018 G mortality tables. The provisions were discounted at the market interest rate of the preceding ten years
published by Deutsche Bundesbank (10-year average interest rate) assuming that all liabilities have a remaining maturity
of 15 years (section 253(2) sent. 2 of the HGB).

In accordance with Accounting Practice Statement RH FAB 1.021, newly adopted by the Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany (IDW), direct pension commitments and reinsurance policies entered into to finance pension claims have to be
recorded using matching measurement bases. The new rules provide for a comparison of expected cash flows from the
direct pension commitment and the related reinsurance policies. Accordingly, so-called “matching components” of the
obligation and the reinsurance cover are recognised, in principle, at identical amounts on both the asset and the liability
side of the balance sheet. The new rules are required to be applied for annual financial statements for periods ended on or
after 31 December 2022. If the amount of the liability item is used as the measurement basis for the matching component,
recognition is based on the required settlement amount in accordance with section 253 of the HGB.

Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions:

   - Pension increase: 2.00 % (unchanged from 2021)

   - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2021)

   - Interest rate (10-year average): 1.78 %

   - Interest rate (7-year average): 1.43 %

Pension obligations for which provisions were required to be recognised amounted to €1,610 thousand as at the balance
sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve exclusively to settle liabilities from
post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment by third parties (so-called plan assets). A pledged
pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan asset. Plan assets that serve a specific purpose, have been pledged
and are protected against insolvency were measured based on information from the insurer as at 31 December 2022 at the
asset value (€1,666 thousand; this corresponds to the fair value). The balance remaining after offsetting against the carrying
amount of the pension provision (€56 thousand) is reported on the assets side under “Excess of plan assets over postemployment benefit liability”. Effect on profit in 2022:

   - Interest expense from pension provision: €31 thousand

   - Interest income from plan assets: €33 thousand

F-47


-----

The balance of interest expenses from the measurement of the pension provision (including the effect from changes in
interest) and interest income from the measurement of the plan assets was reported in the financial result. For the financial
year, the balance between the measurement of the pension provision with the 7-year average interest rate and the 10-year
average interest rate amounts to €72 thousand and is subject to a distribution restriction.

In addition, there are pension obligations within Progroup Board S.A.S, Douvrin, France, in the amount of approximately
€159 thousand as at the balance sheet date.

To determine deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for assets,
liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges and deferred income, and their tax bases, or based on tax loss
carryforwards and interest carried forward, the amounts of the resulting tax liability and benefit were measured at the
individual companies’ tax rates (19% – 29.83%) at the point in time when the differences are reversed; they were not
discounted. Deferred tax assets relating to loss carryforwards were taken into account if it was probable that the loss would
be offset within the next five years. Today’s assessment may change in accordance with the companies’ income positions
and tax legislation in future years and may require to be adjusted. In addition, deferred tax assets were recognised in
financial year 2022 on consolidation adjustments for the elimination of intercompany profits in accordance with section
306 HGB as well as deferred tax liabilities from initial consolidation of Progroup Power 1 GmbH acquired in 2015.

Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards of €6,516 thousand (previous year: €4,220 thousand) were fully recognised
because the underlying tax planning confirms that the amounts recognised can actually be utilised to reduce tax liabilities
in the next 5 years. Eligible interest carried forward from the German earnings stripping rule or from other comparable
rules in foreign countries did not exist as at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
reported net.

The companies lease forklifts and trucks under operating lease agreements so that these assets are not recognised in the
companies’ financial statements. As at 31 December 2022, the remaining obligations from the lease agreements for
forklifts, trucks and passenger cars of Progroup AG for the following years amounted to €21,822 thousand. In addition,
there were rental and lease agreements for movable assets as well as for the rental of factory buildings and areas as at the
balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2022, the remaining obligations from these rental/lease agreements for subsequent
years were €11,373 thousand (nominal amount). The advantage of these agreements is that a lower amount of capital is
tied up in the beginning than compared to a purchase and there is an absence of realisation risk. Risks could arise from the
lease agreement periods if the assets can no longer be fully utilised, although there are currently no indications of this.

As at the balance sheet date, there were steam and electricity supply contracts in place for the reliable supply of energy at
fixed prices which did not lead, however, to a recognition. These agreements have terms of up to 2 years (31 December
2024).

Due to specific contractual agreements entered into as at the balance sheet date, total obligations from energy supply
contracts for the following year 2023 amount to €159,153 thousand (previous year: €72,750 thousand).

In addition, as at the balance sheet date, there were contractual purchase commitments for waste paper and corrugated
board base paper supplies; respective commitments are €47,854 thousand (previous year: €58,639 thousand). Furthermore,
there are outstanding purchase commitments for other services in the amount of €53,028 thousand (previous year: €108,150
thousand).

The following independent auditor's report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) has been issued in
accordance with Section 322 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial
statements and group management report of Progroup AG, as of and for the financial year ended 31 December 2022. The
group management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The abovementioned independent auditor's report and the consolidated financial statements are both translations of respective
German-language documents.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To Progroup AG, Offenbach an der Queich

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, Offenbach/Queich, Germany, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2022, and the
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for
the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements,
including the presentation of the recognition and measurement policies. In addition, we have audited the group
management report of Progroup AG for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

   - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of
German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group
as at 31 December 2022 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December
2022 in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, and

   - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In
all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements,
complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future
development.

Pursuant to § [Article] 322 Abs. [paragraph] 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial
Code], we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated
financial statements and of the group management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance
with § 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our
responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for
the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report” section of our auditor’s
report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and
professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

_Other Information_

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the
other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion
thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

F-57


-----

   - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report
disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

   - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the_
_Group Management Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all
material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the consolidated financial statements give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal
control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable
the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e.,
fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided
no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole,
provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as
they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the
applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the
group management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides
an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial
statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents
the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on
the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317
HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

   - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of
arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion
on the effectiveness of these systems.

   - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of
estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

F-58


-----

   - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of
our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as
a going concern.

   - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting
Principles.

   - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group
management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We
remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

   - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

   - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information and evaluate the proper
derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on
the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that
future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.

**PROGROUP AG**

**OFFENBACH A. D. QUEICH, GERMANY**

**COMMERCIAL REGISTER LANDAU, HRB NO. 2268**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2021**

**A.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

The consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, comprising the consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income
statement, notes to the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated cash flow statement and the consolidated
statement of changes in equity, have been prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of Parts One and Two of
the Third Book of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB—German Commercial Code) and the supplementary provisions of the
Aktiengesetz (AktG—German Stock Corporation Act). The previous year’s figures are stated for comparative purposes.

In the interest of greater clarity and transparency, below-the-line items to be reported for consolidated balance sheet or
consolidated income statement line items pursuant to the statutory provisions, as well as disclosures and below-the-line
items which may be reported either in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement or in the notes to
the consolidated financial statements have all been reported in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Insofar as individual consolidated balance sheet items and/or consolidated income statement items have been combined as
part of the statutory regulations so as to provide better transparency, the composition of these line items is presented in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements.

**B.** **SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS**

**I.** **Investments in a new Progroup Board plant in Germany**

Planning for the PW15 corrugated sheetfeeder plant are proceeding as planned. The line item “Prepayments and
construction in process” of Progroup Board GmbH increased in the financial year 2021 by €10.1 mn. This growth
was mainly attributable to the construction of the PW15 corrugated sheetfeeder plant in Petersberg (RhinelandPalatinate). Construction on the plant is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023.

**II.** **Investments in a new Progroup Board plant in Poland**

Completion of PW14 in Stryków, Poland, is getting closer. The construction works have continued as planned so that
the PW14 corrugated sheetfeeder plant will be producing corrugated board as from the fourth quarter of 2022. In the
context of these construction works, the line item “Prepayments and construction in process” rose be €32.3 mn.

**III.** **Early repayment of loans in the amount of €80.0 mn**

Two loans were fully redeemed ahead of schedule thanks to the growth of cash funds in 2021. One 30 million euro facility,
originally used to finance the PM3 investment and with final maturity on 31 December 2023, was fully repaid at the end of
2021. The facility granted by the German state development bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) in the amount of
€100 mn was agreed during the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic in order to have sufficient flexibility in order to
account for any uncertainties surrounding the pandemic situation. As at 31 December 2020, an amount of €25 mn was
utilised. In January 2021, a further amount of €25 mn was drawn down. Overall, only an amount of €50 mn of the original
nominal value was utilised. The total amount outstanding was repaid during the fourth quarter as a result of the comfortable
liquidity position. The final maturity of this amortising loan was end of 2025.

**IV.** **Use of prior year net retained profits**

On 12 May 2021, the Annual General Meeting resolved to carry forward to new account the full net retained profits of
€339,730,371.12. As in the previous year, there was no dividend distribution.

**C.** **BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION**

The subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are presented in section F. III. 3 and 4 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

The scope of consolidation remains unchanged compared with 31 December 2020.

**D.** **PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION**

Acquisitions made until 31 December 2009 continue to be accounted for in accordance with section 66(3) of the
Einführungsgesetz zum Handelsgesetzbuch (EGHGB—Introductory Act to the German Commercial Code), using the
carrying amount method under section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB (former version) by eliminating the cost of the equity
investments against the proportionate amount that these shares represent in the equity of the subsidiaries.

Acquisitions made after 31 December 2009 are accounted for in accordance with section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB (as
amended) using the purchase method. With this method, the acquisition cost of the investments is eliminated against
the equity reflecting the fair value of the assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred income as well as special
items to be included in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.

Receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies have been eliminated, with receivables and liabilities of
€1,319,900 thousand being eliminated outside profit or loss.

In the financial year 2021, intercompany profits from Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH’s, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH’s and
Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH’s paper deliveries to affiliated companies increased to €4,406 thousand; they were eliminated
through profit or loss. Intragroup sales, intragroup other operating income and interest income have been eliminated against
corresponding expenses, with expenses and income of €740,841 thousand having been eliminated.

Deferred taxes are generally recognised for first-time consolidation adjustments recognised outside profit or loss as well as
for consolidation adjustments recognised through profit or loss. In 2021, consolidation adjustments recognised through
profit or loss related exclusively to the elimination of intercompany profits. Deferred tax assets of €1,574 thousand
(previous year: €260 thousand) were recognised on eliminated intercompany profits of €5,277 thousand (previous
year: €871 thousand).

**E.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**I.** **Disclosure of accounting policies applied**

**Intangible assets are measured at cost less amortisation. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the standard**
useful lives. The intangible assets are amortised over a useful life of 3 to 10 years. To the extent that the fair values of
individual intangible fixed assets fall below their carrying amounts, additional impairment losses are recorded in case of an
expected permanent impairment.

**Tangible fixed assets are measured at purchase and production cost less depreciation. Depreciation on additions to tangible**
fixed assets is generally recorded pro rata temporis. To the extent that the fair values of individual assets fall below their
carrying amounts, additional impairment losses are recorded in case of an expected permanent impairment.

The purchase costs comprise expenses incurred to acquire an asset and to bring it to its working condition to the extent that
such costs can be allocated individually to such asset. Production cost comprises, if applicable, direct material costs, direct
labour costs and special costs of production, appropriate and necessary indirect material costs and indirect labour costs,
general and administrative costs and expenses for social amenities, for voluntary social benefits and for occupational
pensions. Borrowing costs have also been included in production cost to the extent that they were attributable to the period
of production.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the standard useful lives. Buildings are depreciated over a useful life
of 33 years, technical equipment and machinery over a useful life of 10–17 years, and other equipment, factory and office
equipment over a useful life of 3–8 years.

As at 1 July 2020, the useful life for the paper mill (PM2) was adjusted from previously 25 to now 17 years. This resulted
in an increase of depreciation by €13.0 mn in 2021 (previous year, 1 July to 31 December 2020: €6.5 mn).

Prepayments made are presented in the balance sheet at their nominal amount.

F-72


-----

**Financial assets are measured at cost or, in the event of an expected permanent impairment, at their lower fair value as at**
the balance sheet date.

**Investment grants are reported separately at their nominal amount on the liabilities side under the special item “Investment**
grants for fixed assets” and are reversed in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for which the grants were
awarded.

Low-value assets costing up to €250.00 each are fully written off in the year of acquisition. Assets which are capable of
being used independently and which cost between €250.00 and €1,000.00 are posted to a collective item in the year of
acquisition; this collective item is reversed as a charge to profit or loss over 5 years.

**Inventories are measured at cost, taking account of the lower of cost or market value. Appropriate valuation allowances**
are recorded for any identifiable risks resulting from above-average storage periods, reduced recoverability and/or lower
replacement costs. In all cases, fair value measurement was applied, i. e. write-downs are recognised to the extent that the
expected selling prices less costs incurred prior to disposal result in a lower fair value.

**Raw materials, consumables and supplies are measured at actual cost or, taking account of the principle of lower of cost**
or market value, at lower market values as at the reporting date.Replacement parts for machines are also recognised under
raw materials, consumables and supplies. Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to inventories which are obsolete,
second-hand, damaged or slow-moving. Lump-sum valuation allowances amounting to €8,394 thousand (previous year:
€7,184 thousand) were applied to replacement parts which are obsolete, second-hand or slow-moving.

**Work in process and finished goods are measured at production cost. Production cost comprises, if applicable, direct**
material costs, direct labour costs and special costs of production, appropriate and necessary indirect material costs, indirect
labour costs, depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets that is attributable to the production process and general and
administrative costs and costs of occupational pensions. Borrowing costs are not included in production cost.

**Receivables and other assets as well as the remaining assets are recognised at their principal amount or at their lower fair**
value as at the balance sheet date.

Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to receivables whose recoverability is associated with identifiable risks;
irrecoverable receivables are written off in full.

To cover the general risk from trade receivables, a global valuation allowance of 1% is recognised on domestic and foreign
receivables (net of value added tax) which are not subject to a specific valuation allowance.

**Cash in hand and bank balances are measured at their nominal amounts.**

Payments before the balance sheet date are recognised as prepaid expenses to the extent that they represent an expense for
a specific period of time after this date.

**Subscribed capital is recognised at its calculated amount.**

**Provisions are recognised at the settlement amount dictated by prudent business judgement. Provisions are recognised for**
liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount as well as for losses from onerous contracts. All risks arising up to the balance
sheet date and identifiable up to the date of the preparation of the financial statements have been taken into account.
Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year have to be discounted using the average market interest rate of the
last seven years applicable for their remaining term, while pension provisions are discounted using the average market
interest rate of the past ten years.

**Liabilities are carried at their settlement amount.**

Payments received before the reporting date are recognised as deferred income to the extent that they represent income for
a specific time period after this date.

**Deferred tax liabilities are recognised at their calculated amount. For further explanations, please refer to Chapter F.**

**II.** **Changes in accounting policies applied**

As from January 2021, the accounting policies applied within the Group were changed due to the high share of pallet sales.
Pallets held as external inventory are now reported as current assets (balance as at 31 December 2021: €1.6 mn).
Furthermore, production-related maintenance expenses were reclassified in the financial year 2021 from other operating

F-73


-----

expenses to costs of materials (1 January – 31 December 2021: €24.9 mn; comparative period 1 January – 31 December
2020: €19.9 mn), following an analysis of expense accounts.

**III.** **Currency translation disclosures**

Receivables, other assets, cash and cash equivalents and provisions and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated during the year into euros. Measurement as at the balance sheet date is at the average spot exchange rate on 31
December 2021, with the principle of lower of cost or market value, or higher settlement amount, as appropriate, being
taken into account for receivables and liabilities with a maturity of over one year in accordance with section 256a of the
HGB.

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from currency translation are recognised in other operating income or expenses.

Translation of foreign subsidiary annual financial statements is carried out using the modified closing rate method in
accordance with section 308a HGB.

Currency translation differences from the consolidation of intercompany balances are recognised directly in currency
translation adjustments in equity.

**F.** **DISCLOSURES AND EXPLANATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED**
**BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT**

The financial year of all companies included in the consolidated financial statements corresponds to the calendar year.

**I.** **Consolidated balance sheet**

**1.** **Fixed assets**

In connection with the acquisition of Progroup Power 1 GmbH in 2015 and related revaluation of acquired fixed assets in
correspondence with the capital consolidation, an operating license at acquisition cost of €23,894 thousand has been
acquired. Subsequently, the operating license has been amortised since 2015 over a remaining useful life of 10 years. As at
the balance sheet date, the residual carrying amount is €9,629 thousand with a remaining term of 4 years.

The classification and movement in the financial year of the fixed asset accounts recognised in the consolidated financial
statements are separately presented as an appendix to the notes to the financial statements in the fixed asset movement
schedule.

Intangible assets include prepayments for the implementation of SAP S4 Hana in the amount of €14.4 mn (previous year:
€3.5 mn).

Fixed asset production cost includes capitalised borrowing costs of €35 thousand which were attributable to the period of
production. The capitalised borrowing costs were recognised in tangible fixed assets in the line item “Construction in
process” and were subsequently reclassified to factory buildings as well as to technical equipment and machinery. Interest
capitalised in previous years was capitalised in tangible fixed assets, primarily in buildings and technical equipment and
machinery.

The value of construction in process as at 31 December 2021 is €74.7 mn (previous year: €7.9 mn), mainly resulting from
the Progroup Board plant in Stryków, Poland, as well as the Progroup Board plants in Piadena Drizzona, Italy, and in
Petersberg (Rhineland-Palatinate), Germany.

**2.** **Receivables and other assets**

As in the previous year, receivables and other assets do not include receivables due in more than one year.

There were no receivables from affiliated companies as at the balance sheet date. The full amount of receivables from
shareholders refers to sales and services.

Furthermore, other assets include input tax refund claims in an amount of €268 thousand (previous year: €456 thousand),
which in accordance with tax law provisions come into existence only after the balance sheet date.

F-74


-----

**3.** **Prepaid expenses and deferred charges**

Prepaid expenses and deferred charges for the financial year total €10,200 thousand (previous year: €13,007 thousand).

As a result of the pledging of shares of the shareholders, these shareholders were granted a liability compensation. This
liability compensation is reported as prepaid expenses in the financial statements of Progroup AG and is reversed rateably
over the term of the financings. The amount deferred as at the reporting date amounts to €8,645 thousand (previous year:
€11,488 thousand).

**4.** **Subscribed capital**

The share capital of the parent company is €7,588,236.00 and is divided into 7,588,236 no-par value shares with a calculated
amount of subscribed capital of one euro each. Distribution potential is based on the annual financial statements of Progroup
AG. The articles of association do not contain any restrictions on distributions. There is a restriction on distributions
pursuant to section 253(6) of the HGB in connection with the measurement of pension obligations in the amount of €119
thousand (previous year: €154 thousand).

**5.** **Investment grants for fixed assets**

Investment grants as well as redemption subsidies for fixed assets are reported as a special reserve and are reversed on a
pro rata basis in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for which the grants were awarded.

**6.** **Pension provisions**

As at 31 December 2021, the balance amounts to €583 thousand (previous year: €516 thousand).

This amount mainly includes pension provisions which were measured in accordance with the PUC method (projected unit
credit) using Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck’s 2018 G mortality tables.

The provisions were discounted at the market interest rate of the preceding ten years published by Deutsche Bundesbank
(10-year average interest rate) assuming that all liabilities have a remaining maturity of 15 years (section 253(2) sent. 2 of
the HGB).

Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions:

  - Pension increase: 2.00% (unchanged from 2020)

  - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2020)

  - Interest rate (10-year average): 1.90%

  - Interest rate (7-year average): 1.36%

Pension obligations for which provisions were required to be recognised amounted to €1,646 thousand as at the balance
sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve exclusively to settle liabilities from
post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment by third parties(so-called plan assets). A pledged
pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan asset. Plan assets that serve a specific purpose, have been pledged
and are protected against insolvency were measured based on information from the insurer as at 31 December 2021 at the
asset value (€1,290 thousand; this corresponds to the fair value). The balance remaining after the offset with the carrying
amount of the pension provision (€356 thousand) is reported under “provisions for pensions”.

Effect on profit in 2021:

  - Interest expense from pension provision: €38 thousand

  - Interest income from plan assets: €45 thousand

The balance of interest expenses from the measurement of the pension provision (including the effect from changes in
interest) and interest income from the measurement of the plan assets was reported net in the financial result. For the
financial year, the balance between the measurement of the pension provision with the 7-year average interest rate and the
10-year average interest rate amounts to €119 thousand and is subject to a distribution restriction at the level of the
individual financial statements of Progroup AG.

In addition, there are pension obligations within Progroup Board S.A.S., Douvrin, France, in theamount of approximately
€226 thousand as at the balance sheet date.

To determine deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for assets,
liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges and deferred income, and their tax bases, or based on tax loss
carryforwards and interest carried forward, the amounts of the resulting tax liability and benefit were measured at the
individual companies’ tax rates (19% – 29.83%) at the point in time when the differences are reversed; they were not
discounted. Deferred tax assets relating to loss carryforwards were taken into account if it was probable that the loss would
be offset within the next five years. Today’s assessment may change in accordance with the companies’ income positions
and tax legislation in future years and may require to be adjusted. In addition, deferred tax assets were recognised in
financial year 2021 on consolidation adjustments for the elimination of intercompany profits in accordance with section
306 HGB as well as deferred tax liabilities from initial consolidation of Progroup Power 1 GmbH acquired in 2015.

Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards of €4,220 thousand (previous year: €4,790 thousand) were fully recognised
because the underlying tax planning confirms that the amounts recognised could actually be utilised to reduce tax liabilities
in the next 5 years. Eligible interest carried forward from the German earnings stripping rule or from other comparable rules
in foreign countries did not exist as at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are reported
net.

The bonds outstanding on the balance sheet date and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, which can also be utilised
by subsidiaries of Progroup AG, as well as of all bank loans existing within the Progroup Group are secured by pledging
all shares in Progroup AG and the company shares in its main subsidiaries, by pledging the bank deposits of the parent
company, by assigning tangible fixed assets of the subsidiaries and by granting real estate liens. Furthermore, certain
covenants apply with regard to the loans and/or bonds.

The notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility as well as any bank loans of the Progroup Group are secured pari

various suppliers of subsidiaries. The parent company also has assumed joint and several co-liability vis-à-vis

The companies lease forklifts and trucks under operating lease agreements so that these assets are not recognised in the
companies’ financial statements. As at 31 December 2021, the remaining obligations from the lease agreements were
€15,442 thousand. In addition, there were rental and lease agreements for movable assets as well as for the rental of factory
buildings and areas as at the balance sheet date. As at 31 December 2021, the remaining obligations from these rental/lease
agreements for subsequent years were €18,601 thousand (nominal amount). The advantage of these agreements is that a
lower amount of capital is tied up in the beginning than with a purchase and there is an absence of realisation risk. Risks
could arise from the lease agreement periods if the assets can no longer be fully utilised, although there are currently no
indications of this.

fixed prices which did not lead, however, to a recognition. These agreements have terms of up to 3 years (31 December

The following independent auditor's report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) has been issued in
accordance with Section 322 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial
statements and group management report of Progroup AG, as of and for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. The
group management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. The abovementioned independent auditor's report and the consolidated financial statements are both translations of respective
German-language documents.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

**To Progroup AG, Offenbach an der Queich**

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, Offenbach/Queich, Germany, and its subsidiaries
(the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2021, and the consolidated income
statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year from 1
January to 31 December 2021, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the presentation of the
recognition and measurement policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Progroup AG for the
financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

  - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements
of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of
the Group as at 31 December 2021 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to
31 December 2021 in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, and

  - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial
statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks
of future development.

Pursuant to § [Article] 322 Abs. [paragraph] 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial
Code], we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated
financial statements and of the group management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance
with § 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschahsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our
responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for
the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report” section of our auditor’s
report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and
professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

_Other Information_

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the
other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion
thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

F-85


-----

  - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report
disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

  - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the_
_Group Management Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all
material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the consolidated financial statements
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in
compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles. In addition, the executive directors are responsible
for such internal control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have
determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of
accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a
whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such
arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group
management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide
sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole
provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that
includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317
HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group
management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of
arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion
on the effectiveness of these systems.

-----

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of
estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

  - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

  - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting
Principles.

  - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group
management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We
remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

  - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

  - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper
derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on
the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that
future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
