In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as ‘‘aim’’, ‘‘anticipate’’, ‘‘believe’’, ‘‘continue’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘estimate’’, ‘‘expect’’, ‘‘forecast’’, ‘‘guidance’’, ‘‘intend’’, ‘‘may’’, ‘‘ongoing’’, ‘‘plan’’, ‘‘potential’’, ‘‘predict’’, ‘‘projected’’, ‘‘propose’’, ‘‘seek’’, ‘‘should’’, ‘‘targets’’ or ‘‘will’’ or the negative of such terms or other variation or comparable terminology. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous assumptions and that our actual results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: - the level of economic growth and activity and fluctuations in the demand for our products; - the cyclical nature of the containerboard and corrugated board industry and industry-wide production capacity; - operational disruptions at our facilities; - risks associated with our expansion and other investment projects, in particular our new paper machine project; - pricing pressure, consolidation of our customers, product substitution and competition in the markets in which we operate; - fluctuations in the costs of our raw materials and other input costs and our ability to pass on increases to our customers; - our ability to secure a reliable supply of raw materials, including recycled paper; - the availability of, and increases in the costs of transportation; - increases in energy costs and loss of financial privileges in this respect; - failure to successfully continue our Continuous Improvement Program and to further improve our operational efficiency and asset utilization and to successfully implement our business strategy; - adverse effects arising from costs and difficulties of acquiring and integrating complementary businesses; - our ability to comply with numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations as well as changes to such laws and regulations; - currency exchange rate fluctuations; - insufficient insurance coverage; - loss of key customers or key personnel; - risks arising from uncertainties regarding the European Monetary Union; - IT and communication system failure or data loss; - tax risks attributable to previous tax assessment periods and risks associated with restrictions on the deduction of interest expense or forfeiture of interest carry forwards under German tax laws; v ----- - our substantial leverage and debt service obligations; - limited operating flexibility due to financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; - risks of a default under our debt agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment; - risks associated with our capital structure, the Notes, the Guarantees and our other indebtedness; - force majeure and other unforeseeable events; and - other factors discussed in ‘‘Risk Factors’’. The risks described in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section of this offering memorandum are not exhaustive. Other sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive industry. New risks may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Since we commenced operations in 1992, we have carefully selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a greenfield strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we operate. As a result, we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high technological standards, resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and relatively low requirements for additional capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the high technological standards of our production facilities, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for light-weight packaging, (ii) the increasing importance of small-size packaging due to the growing importance of e-commerce, and (iii) the general trend towards a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and energy, which can help reduce costs, CO2 emissions and fresh water consumption. 1 ----- Our core business comprises Paper and Board. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible containerboard production using almost exclusively recycled paper, with high output volumes to increase cost efficiency and short delivery times. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and the first three months of 2019, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for most of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and the ability of Board to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. In addition, our customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options. Paper manufactures containerboard at our two paper mills in Germany, with an envisaged total annual production capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons of containerboard. Our two existing paper machines, PM1 in Burg and PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, have complementary production layouts which allow us to produce brown containerboard with grammages between 60-230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recycled paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the appropriate widths for Board’s ten existing corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a total annual production capacity of approximately 1,440,000 tons of corrugated board, including our latest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) at Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom. Our historic greenfield location strategy ensures close customer proximity and high production flexibility. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we further acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH, the combined heat and power plant (the ‘‘CHP’’) adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and certain related assets (the ‘‘CHP Acquisition’’). As a result thereof, we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves (‘‘Power’’). In 2018, we sold approximately 1,151,000 tons of corrugated board and approximately 176,000 tons of containerboard to external customers across Europe, resulting in external corrugated board and containerboard sales, respectively, of A840.0 million (86.9% of total sales) and A84.5 million (8.7% of total sales). Paper’s total sales in 2018 include A17.9 million (1.9% of total sales) in revenues from the sale of electricity and revenues from the incineration of refuse-derived fuel resulting from the integration of the CHP as well as A9.7 million (1.0% of total sales) in sales from passing purchased fuel costs to Sales and Solutions GmbH. Total external sales by Board and Paper in 2018 (including sales other than corrugated board or containerboard sales, respectively) amounted to A840.8 million (87.0% of total sales) and A112.9 million (11.7% of total sales). Our total sales and EBITDA in 2018 amounted to A966.1 million and A275.5 million, respectively.

The trend towards ‘‘light paper’’ (i.e., containerboard) has been particularly strong in Germany and has been further strengthened by the increasingly online and mail order-driven retail sector, which is expected to further stimulate demand growth for light packaging solutions. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany, which specializes in the production of super-light-weight to medium-weight containerboard with grammages of 60-130g/m[2]. As demand for super-light-weight containerboard (with a grammage below 90g/m[2]) is increasing, we believe that PM2 gives us a significant advantage over many of our competitors, both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Our proposed further paper machine PM3, on the other hand, is designed to provide standard containerboard grades with grammages of 90-130g/m[2]. Once this newest paper machine will commence operation, we believe it will give us the ability to put an even stronger focus on the production of super-light-weight containerboard (i.e. 70 - 80g) at PM2 and to focus production at PM1 on specialty containerboard such as kraftliner substitutes and containerboard with a higher grammages above 130g/m[2].

In particular, we are focused on further reducing the use of fibre (i.e., recycled paper) in our products as well as the amount of energy required for our production processes and the shipment of our products, in order to both maintain a competitive cost position in our industry and to reduce emissions and waste. We believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001, our paper machine PM1 was the world’s technologically most advanced containerboard paper machine setting new technology standards, including with the use of a closed water cycle, thereby minimizing the creation of waste water. Launched in 2010, we believe that PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machines, which we believe has allowed us to set new industry standards with respect to raw material efficiency. As described in more detail under ‘‘—Our _Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled investments’’ below, we further decided to make certain significant additional_ investments in connection with the proposed establishment of our newest paper machine (PM3), which we expect will result in significant cost savings in the mid- to long-term as well as significant reductions of CO2 emissions, waste water and natural gas consumption. These investments include a state-of-the-art waste overall waste-heat concept as well as a ‘‘first-of-its-kind’’ closed cycle waste water treatment system. We have invested significantly in the development of a ‘‘green’’ range of ‘‘next generation’’ products working in close cooperation with BHS Corrugated GmbH, one of our equipment suppliers, and a team of researchers at the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f¨ur angewandte Wissenschaften) in Regensburg, Germany. We market these products under our own brands next fibre�, next board� and next box�. All of these product innovations involve the use of super-light-weight containerboard produced by our paper machine PM2 as well as innovative flute designs of our corrugated board formats, intended to further reduce raw material input and thereby further reduce weight, input costs and CO2 emissions. There are general industry trends towards lighter and more functional packaging and towards a more efficient use of resources. The trend towards ‘‘light paper’’ (i.e., containerboard) has been particularly strong in Germany and has been further strengthened by the increasingly online and mail order-driven retail sector, which is expected to further stimulate demand growth for light packaging solutions. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany, which specializes in the production of super-light-weight to medium-weight containerboard with grammages of 60-130g/m[2]. As demand for super-light-weight containerboard (with a grammage below 90g/m[2]) is increasing, we believe that PM2 gives us a significant advantage over many of our competitors, both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Our proposed further paper machine PM3, on the other hand, is designed to provide standard containerboard grades with grammages of 90-130g/m[2]. Once this newest paper machine will commence operation, we believe it will give us the ability to put an even stronger focus on the production of super-light-weight containerboard (i.e. 70 - 80g) at PM2 and to focus production at PM1 on specialty containerboard such as kraftliner substitutes and containerboard with a higher grammages above 130g/m[2]. We believe the expected further specialization of our paper machines will further enhance the productivity of all our paper machines as each paper mill will be able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. For more detail on our proposed new paper machine (PM3), see also ‘‘—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated _board producer in Europe through controlled investments’’ below._ In addition, we continuously work to improve our product designs, optimize the utilization of our assets and explore new ways to further reduce our input costs and secure the long-term sustainability of our core businesses, both from an economic and environmental perspective. In particular, we are focused on further reducing the use of fibre (i.e., recycled paper) in our products as well as the amount of energy required for our production processes and the shipment of our products, in order to both maintain a competitive cost position in our industry and to reduce emissions and waste. 136 30MAY201908580748 ----- We believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001, our paper machine PM1 was the world’s technologically most advanced containerboard paper machine setting new technology standards, including with the use of a closed water cycle, thereby minimizing the creation of waste water. Launched in 2010, we believe that PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machines, which we believe has allowed us to set new industry standards with respect to raw material efficiency.

As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production capacity in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have increased from approximately 62% (or 67%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to approximately 82% (or 93%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2018. With the fast and successful ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland during 2017 and early 2018, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. As we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020) and plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023 (including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early 2021), we expect to successively increase this net short position with regard to containerboard even further at least in the short-term. We therefore currently do not expect the volume of our external containerboard sales to significantly increase again unless and until we complete our proposed further paper machine project (PM3) in the second half of 2020.

In 2018, approximately 811,000 tons were sold internally to Board (2016: 738,000 tons of internal containerboard 6 ----- sales), and a further approximately 111,500 tons were sold pursuant to swap agreements with other containerboard producers (2016: 106,000 tons of sales to swap partners), which allow us to reduce transportation costs, optimize our production program and swap internally produced containerboard for certain containerboard grades we do not produce in sufficient quantities, such as kraftliner.

We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. At the same time, we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or improve our overall Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared to corrugated board margins) of certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options.

In addition to further capacity expansion, our ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy, among other things, also contemplates a gradual technological transition and generation change away from the use of corrugators with a trim width of 2.5m, which are installed and currently in use at some of our older corrugated board production sites, to the use of more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our corrugated board production sites. Following the successful completion of the ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which commenced production in October 2015, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals in 2016 and were already operating within our target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. However, in the short-term to mid-term, we still intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market opportunities for profitable growth, similar to those that led to the successful establishment of our most recent production sites (PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12) in Pl¨ossberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland), Drizzona (Italy) and Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom). In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we intend to primarily achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion opportunities via greenfield projects. In addition to the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland during 2017 and early 2018 following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, we commenced production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, in early March 2018 and at our newest corrugated production site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, in January 2019. As with our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany and our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we established our production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of a customer, Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l., which allows us to supply this new customer largely without freight and other logistics costs. The commencement of production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 100,000 tons, also marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. With a total investment of approximately A85-A90 million into the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom to replace our now decommissioned corrugated board production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers from the new site, we have now also become a significant player in the UK market. This newest corrugated board production site operates with a 3.35m 8 ----- trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), which we established in 2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width. We believe that the new production site, with its large capacity and state-of-the-art equipment, is one of the largest and most efficient corrugated sheet board plants globally and positions us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we have historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins. While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including the three packaging park projects (PW9, PW10 and PW11), our newest corrugated board production site (PW12) in the United Kingdom as well as the proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW13 and PW14), we are also evaluating and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire attractive assets from competitors which would complement our existing network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our corrugated board production capacity and meet the other internal investment and financing criteria described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our relationships with certain large and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with significant new customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers. With the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. In the short-term to mid-term, we nevertheless intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production capacity. We have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020. We expect to make total net investments (net of subsidies) of approximately A60 million at this site, which is slightly higher than our earlier estimates of approximately A50 million. This cost increase primarily relates to additional investments which will increase the annual corrugated board production capacity of the new site to approximately 175,000 tons, from the originally proposed capacity of approximately 140,000 tons. Higher than originally expected civil engineering costs (due to the booming construction sector) also contributed to the expected overall cost increase. In addition, we plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023, including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14), which we expect will operate with a 3.35m trim width and have an annual corrugated board production capacity of up to 215,000 tons. We expect to invest approximately A70-75 million into this new plant, which will have capabilities similar to our ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and, we plan, will commence production in late 2020 or early 2021. Primarily to fund our expected investments into this new site, we entered into the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, with total commitments of A75 million. For more details about these New Senior Secured Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior _Secured Erste Bank Facility’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’. As a_ result of these proposed additional corrugated board production sites, we expect our annual corrugated board production capacity to increase from approximately 3.0 billion square meters (including our corrugated board production sites (PW11 and PW12) in Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom) to approximately 4.2 billion square meters. To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe in the long-term and to allow us to successfully meet ongoing and expected future market growth and the requirements of our customers with regard to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of our production facilities as part of our long-term ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy, as long as (i) we are confident we can achieve payback periods for our investments that are aligned with the maturity profile and relevant headroom under our financing arrangements, (ii) we maintain sufficient financial flexibility to weather and/or adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole, and (iii) any such investments would be consistent with our long-term target leverage.

Following the successful completion of the ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which commenced production in October 2015, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals in 2016 and were already operating within our target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. However, in the short-term to mid-term, we still intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market opportunities for profitable growth, similar to those that led to the successful establishment of our most recent production sites (PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12) in Pl¨ossberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland), Drizzona (Italy) and Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom). In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we intend to primarily achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion opportunities via greenfield projects. In addition to the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland during 2017 and early 2018 following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, we commenced production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, in early March 2018 and at our newest corrugated production site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, in January 2019. As with our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany and our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we established our production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of a customer, Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l., which allows us to supply this new customer largely without freight and other logistics costs. The commencement of production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 100,000 tons, also marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. With a total investment of approximately A85-A90 million into the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom to replace our now decommissioned corrugated board production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers from the new site, we have now also become a significant player in the UK market. This newest corrugated board production site operates with a 3.35m trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), which we established in 2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width. We believe that the new production site, with its large capacity and state-of-the-art equipment, is one of the largest and most efficient corrugated sheet board plants globally and positions us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we have historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins. While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including the three packaging park projects (PW9, PW10 and PW11), our newest corrugated board production site (PW12) in the United 139 ----- Kingdom as well as the proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW13 and PW14), we are also evaluating and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire attractive assets from competitors which would complement our existing network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our corrugated board production capacity and meet the other internal investment and financing criteria described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our relationships with certain large and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with significant new customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers. With the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. In the short-term to mid-term, we nevertheless intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production capacity. We have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020. We expect to make total net investments (net of subsidies) of approximately A60 million at this site, which is slightly higher than our earlier estimates of approximately A50 million. This cost increase primarily relates to additional investments which will increase the annual corrugated board production capacity of the new site to approximately 175,000 tons, from the originally proposed capacity of approximately 140,000 tons. Higher than originally expected civil engineering costs (due to the booming construction sector) also contributed to the expected overall cost increase. In addition, we plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023, including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14), which we expect will operate with a 3.35m trim width and have an annual corrugated board production capacity of up to 215,000 tons. We expect to invest approximately A70-75 million into this new plant, which will have capabilities similar to our ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and, we envisage, will commence production in late 2020 or early 2021. Primarily to fund our expected investments into this new site, we entered into the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, with total commitments of A75 million. For more details about these New Senior Secured Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior _Secured Erste Bank Facility’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’. As a_ result of these proposed additional corrugated board production sites, we expect our annual corrugated board production capacity to increase from approximately 3.0 billion square meters (including our corrugated board production sites (PW11 and PW12) in Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom) to approximately 4.2 billion square meters.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

Following completion of the ramp-up phase of this potential further paper mill, this would mean an increase of the total annual containerboard capacity of Paper from currently approximately 1,100,000 tons to approximately 1,850,000 tons. The new paper machine (PM3) will have a 9.2m trim width, which would allow us to optimize containerboard production to meet the requirements of the more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our newer corrugated board production sites, which would result in low volumes of cutting scrap and higher productivity. Once PM3 has commenced operations, we also plan for further specialization of our then three paper machines which we expect will further enhance the productivity of all our paper machines as each paper mill will be able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. See also ‘‘—Our _Strengths—Technology and innovation leader’’ above. We currently expect total net investment costs (i.e. net_ of expected subsidies) of approximately A465 million for this new paper machine project over a several year period, including approximately A116.7 million of initial expenditures (e.g. for advanced payments for the paper machine and certain preliminary work) we had already incurred as of the end of the first quarter of 2019. We expect to fund any such investments with a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from our operating activities and additional borrowings, including drawings under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility. The currently expected total net investment costs of approximately A465 million in connection with the proposed establishment of our newest paper mill (PM3) significantly exceed our earlier estimates of A375-400 million, primarily due to certain additional strategic and value accretive investments we decided to make, which we expect to have significant economical as well as ecological benefits once the new paper mill will be operational. A large portion of the increase in the expected total net investment costs relates to investments into more energy-efficient components as part of our overall waste-heat concept from the new paper mill. The installation of these components is not legally mandated, but we expect it will result in significant cost savings in the mid- to long-term as well as a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 151,000 tons per year. In addition, we decided to install a closed cycle waste water treatment system. Once our new paper mill is operating at the full intended capacity of 750,000 tons of containerboard, we expect that this closed cycle waste water treatment system will help us to avoid approximately 3,775,000 m[3] of waste water per year, cut the fresh water consumption of the new paper mill by 3,750,000 m[3] and reduce CO2 emissions by approximately a further 19,900 tons per year. At full capacity, the system is expected to produce approximately 65,000,000 kWh per year of bio gas as part of the waste water treatment process. The paper mill will use this bio gas in connection with its production process, cutting its natural gas consumption by approximately 7-8%. We further believe that the proposed closed cycle waste water system will minimize our reliance on third party waste water treatment facilities (which have led to capacity constraints at our existing paper machine (PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany in the past) and result in significant related cost savings in the future. We further decided to install (i) a steam turbine which will allow us to produce a portion of the electricity requirements of the new paper mill in an environmentally friendly manner and (ii) a direct rail connection, which will give us the option to ship a portion of our future production in an environmentally friendly manner by rail and, we believe, result in savings of freight cost and other operational benefits. An increase in the expected costs of the necessary civil engineering works, due to the booming construction sector, also contributed to the overall increase in the expected total net investment costs. In order to preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner in sufficient quantities to meet the majority of the sourcing requirements of the expanding corrugated board production within Board, we have also begun to actively pursue the realization of a further paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.

However, this right is currently suspended until October 2022. As a result, the two minority shareholders are currently not able to influence the composition of the Supervisory Board. The shares of the Issuer held by JH-Holding and our two minority shareholders will be included as part of the Collateral as of the issue date of the Additional Notes, although the Conditions of Issue will provide that the Security Agent will, at the request of the Issuer, a Guarantor or another security provider, release the Liens over the shares of the Issuer (without requiring the consent of the Holders’ Representative or the Holders), upon the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) over such shares, so long as no Event of Default exists at such time or would arise as a result of such release. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release of _Collateral’’._ (2) The Issuer is offering A150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes pursuant to this offering memorandum. (3) The Existing Notes are senior secured obligations of the Issuer and are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors. The Existing Notes and all obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities are, and all obligations under the New Senior Secured Facilities and, upon issuance of the Additional Notes, the Additional Notes will be, secured by the Collateral, which 13 ----- also secures the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Liabilities, although any liabilities in respect of obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Liabilities will receive priority over those of the Holders. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility’’ and ‘‘—Intercreditor Agreement’’. As of and for the twelve-month period_ ended March 31, 2019, the Issuer and the Guarantors accounted, on a consolidated basis, for 90.2% of our consolidated revenues (effects of intragroup transactions eliminated), 99.5% of our EBITDA (effects of intragroup transactions eliminated) and 96.4% of our consolidated total assets (effects of intragroup relations eliminated). The Guarantors’ obligations in respect of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Facilities and the Additional Notes may be released in certain circumstances. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There are circumstances other than repayment or _discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral and the Guarantees may be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Holders’ Representative’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and_ ‘‘Description of the Notes—Release of Note Guarantees’’. (4) On April 23, 2015, the Issuer and the then-existing Guarantors entered into the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility which provides for up to A50.0 million of committed credit that may be drawn by certain members of the Group specified therein from time to time. The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is not expected to be drawn as of the issued date of the Additional Notes. The obligations of the borrowers under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (and certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities) are guaranteed on a senior basis by the Issuer and the Guarantors and are secured by the same Collateral that secures the Existing Notes and the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and that will secure all obligations under the New Senior Secured Facilities and, upon issuance of the Additional Notes, the Additional Notes, on a super priority basis pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility contains an uncommitted ‘‘accordion feature’’ which gives us the option to increase the total commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility from currently A50,000,000 to up to A80,000,000. For more details, see ‘‘Summary—The Refinancing’’, ‘‘Description of _Certain Financing Arrangements—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor Agreement’’._ (5) The Existing Notes and the Guarantees with regard to the Existing Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities are, and the New Senior Secured Facilities and, upon issuance of the Additional Notes, the Additional Notes and related Guarantees will be, secured by first-priority security interests over (i) the shares of the Issuer, Progroup Board S.A.S. and each Guarantor; (ii) certain real property; (iii) certain bank accounts of the Issuer; and (iv) certain fixed and other assets (collectively, the ‘‘Collateral’’). For further details on the Collateral, see ‘‘Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release of Collateral’’. The Collateral will be subject to certain significant contractual and legal limitations or subject to certain defenses under applicable law, as described under ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on _enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability’’ and_ ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security _Interests’’. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts received or recovered in respect of enforcement of all_ or any part of the Collateral are required to be turned over to the Security Agent and, subject to the payment of fees and expenses of the agent under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Holders’ Representative, certain other creditor representatives and the Security Agent, paid by the Security Agent first to the discharge in full of the obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities and second to the discharge in full of the Existing Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities, upon accession of the relevant creditors and creditor representatives to the Intercreditor Agreement, the New Senior Secured Facilities and, upon issuance of the Additional Notes, the Additional Notes.

See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There are circumstances _other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral and the Guarantees may be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Holders’ Representative’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release of Collateral’’._ (6) On December 21, 2017, the Issuer and the then-existing Guarantors entered into the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility. The Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities originally provided for a A8.5 million Facility A and a A30.0 million Facility B, which we have fully utilized. However, as of December 31, 2018, the amount repayable under Facility A was reduced to A7.155 million as a result of a A1.345 million repayment grant.

The utilization of the New Senior Secured Facilities is subject to certain conditions precedent. We expect to satisfy all remaining conditions precedent on or around the issue date of the Additional Notes. The New Senior Secured Facilities will remain undrawn on the issue date of the Additional Notes. We may utilize the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and the new Senior Secured SaarLB Facility until June, 2021, May, 2020 and May, 2020, respectively.

The 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility also provided for PLN 107 million of committed credit. As of March 31, 2019, PLN 58.9 million (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A13.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006, which was the exchange rate of the zloty against the euro reported by the National Bank of Poland on March 31, 2019) in borrowings under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding, and PLN 76.0 million (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A17.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006) in borrowings under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the same amounts of borrowings remain outstanding under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility and under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility. The PLN 134.9 million in aggregate borrowings under the Senior Secured PLN Facilities indicated in the diagram above as of March 31, 2019 do not reflect PLN 5.4 million and PLN 4.0 million, respectively, in scheduled repayments under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility and the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility we will be required to make on June 30, 2019.

201,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,"RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity, which is dependent upon factors beyond our control.",13.1.1,,"Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity. Increased levels of economic growth and activity typically result in higher per-capita use of packaging materials, both with respect to transportation of goods and consumer presentation. This increase in the use of packaging materials (including paper-based packaging materials), in turn, results in an increase in the demand for our recycled containerboard and corrugated board products. Because the markets for containerboard and corrugated board products in the developed economies in which we primarily operate are generally mature, historically there has been a close correlation between general economic growth and demand for packaging products such as corrugated containers and, therefore, for their component materials such as containerboard and corrugated board. As a result, our industry is affected by economic conditions in our markets, including changes in national, regional and local unemployment levels, shifts in consumer spending patterns, credit availability, and business and consumer confidence. Disruptions in the overall economy and volatility in the financial markets could reduce consumer confidence, negatively affecting consumer spending, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. We have been impacted by difficult economic conditions in the past. The European debt crisis, for example, resulted in market uncertainty generally and in weak economic conditions, particularly in the Eurozone, which had a significant negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We are unable to predict the timing or duration of any downturn in the economy that may occur in the future or the timing or rate at which economic conditions in our markets may recover in the case of any such downturn. While we experienced historically strong operating results in 2016, 2017 and in particular 2018, we believe it is unlikely that our exceptionally strong operating performance in 2018 will continue or that our margins and/or EBITDA will not materially decline.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,The cyclical nature of our industry often results in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of operations.,13.2.1,,"We principally generate revenue through the sale of containerboard and corrugated board. Our mills primarily sell the containerboard we produce to Group-owned corrugated board plants, and we sell our corrugated board to our third-party customers in the packaging industry. Our operating results are therefore impacted by the packaging industry’s historical cyclical pattern, with periods of overcapacity and resulting pressure on pricing of packaging products such as corrugated containers and, in turn, their component materials such as containerboard and corrugated board. This cyclicality results, in part, from significant imbalances in supply and demand for containerboard. On the one hand, containerboard production capacity cannot be readily adapted to reflect changing market conditions, due to the high capital intensity of facilities such as containerboard mills (which generally continue production as long as paper prices are sufficient to cover their marginal costs), the long lead time between the planning and completion of new containerboard mills and the fact that new additions of containerboard capacity tend to be large relative to the overall demand for the product. On the other hand, significant containerboard and corrugated board price reductions and inventory growth have resulted when capacity has exceeded demand. In addition, there is the potential to convert graphic and newsprint paper machines into 26 ----- containerboard machines which has happened recently both in Europe and the United States, and which may contribute to overcapacity. Consequently, the containerboard and corrugated board industry has from time to time experienced periods of substantial overcapacity and there can be no assurance that this will not reoccur. Overcapacity in the European market has generally had a negative impact on prices. See ‘‘Industry and Competition—End-Markets Dynamics’’ and ‘‘Industry and Competition—Key Market _Developments’’._ In the absence of sufficient economic growth to generate increased demand or the closure of facilities (either temporarily or permanently) to mitigate the effect, new capacity can cause a period of regional overcapacity which may lead to downward pricing and margin pressure. In periods of overcapacity, industry participants may stop operating certain of their production facilities periodically to reduce inventory levels. In the past, many leading paper manufacturers have reacted to reduced demand by taking downtime and by rationalizing high-cost and inefficient capacity. Due to the high level of integration between our two mills and our corrugated board production sites, it is unlikely that we would take downtime at our mills for any significant length of time, but even if we did so and our competitors continue production at high levels, our sales volumes could be adversely affected without any significant offsetting benefit of improved prices in the market. In the event that the industry as a whole does not take sufficient downtime or other measures to reduce capacity during any periods of overcapacity, this could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. Overcapacity in the European containerboard and/or corrugated board markets could be further exacerbated by an increase of imports from other regions and/or a decrease of exports by European producers to other regions, as a result of a variety of factors. For example, in the event that producers in other regions (particularly the United States and China) experience overcapacity within their own local and regional markets, they may seek to increase their level of exports to Europe and do so at lower pricing levels. This could adversely affect our selling prices and profitability. In addition, the level of exports of containerboard from or to Europe also depends on relevant freight rates and currency rates. A strong euro, for example, can have a negative effect on (U.S. dollar-denominated) exports by European containerboard manufacturers with a negative (for our business) effect on the supply and demand balance and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also resulted in lower sales by other European manufacturers who ship products in corrugated packaging, resulting in lower European demand for corrugated packaging, and therefore for our containerboard and corrugated board.

However, our level of customer concentration may increase in the future as a number of industries have experienced consolidation in the past and the packaging industry in which our customers operate may also be affected by consolidation in the future. In addition, while no particular customer is significant to our Group as a whole, a number of our customers account for a significant portion of the sales volumes of one or more of our individual corrugated production sites. Therefore, a loss of one or more of those customers could have a material adverse effect on the utilization and results of operation of the affected corrugated board production sites and negative impact our Group’s total sales. For example, one of our largest customers, which accounted for 4% of our total sales in 2016, commenced production at its own, newly-established corrugated board production facility at the end of 2016. As a result, we lost approximately 90% of our related corrugated board sales with that customer in 2017. If other Board customers similarly establish their own corrugated board production facilities, it is likely that we would also lose most or all of our related corrugated board sales to any such customers. In addition, a large proportion of our customers are small- or medium-sized, family-owned businesses that are managed by members of the owner family. A sale of any of those businesses to one of our competitors or to a box manufacturer with its own corrugated board production, either in connection with a succession event or otherwise, may therefore lead to a loss of the relevant customer. Furthermore, our own performance and potential future growth generally depends, to a large extent, on the performance of our customers, which are exposed to many of the same risks as our own business. Our small- and medium-sized customers may also be particularly vulnerable (i) to competition from larger competitors with greater financial resources and which are able to capitalize on their economies of scale and (ii) to pricing pressure from their own, often much larger customers. 27 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

Our business has in the past faced significant downward pricing pressure, including as a result of standardization in the markets in which we operate. Given the general upward trend in almost all our input costs and the potential for an increase in the currently stable energy prices, we expect we will need to further increase prices in the mid- to long-term to ensure that earnings from recycled containerboard remain at a long-term sustainable economic level. We are likely to continue to be exposed to such factors in the future.

Each of them is, therefore, critical to our business. If operations at either of our two mills were interrupted for any significant length of time, either because of natural disasters (such as flooding or fire), man-made disruptions (such as labor strikes), failure to obtain raw materials, technical defects, accidents or for any other reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. For example, a technical defect at our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt caused multiple shutdowns during 2011 and 2012, resulting in significant loss of containerboard production and significant financial loss, which was only partly covered by compensation payments from one of our equipment manufacturers in the following year. In addition, due to the high level of integration between our two mills and our corrugated board production sites, any significant interruption of our containerboard production at one or both of our mills would also have a significant adverse effect on our corrugated board production and our ability to supply our corrugated board customers. Any significant disruptions at one or more of our corrugated board production sites, either because of problems with our containerboard supply (either from our two mills or from external suppliers) or for any of the other reasons listed above, could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the currently very high level of utilization of most our production sites, our ability to fulfill customer orders from alternative sites in case of a significant disruption at one of more production sites is limited. Finally, the operation of most of our production sites also depends on key services and infrastructure provided by third parties. For example, we rely on highly specialized employees of our equipment suppliers to ensure the proper maintenance and repair of our production equipment. In addition, the uninterrupted operation of our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt depends, among other things, on the availability of a waste water treatment plant operated by the local municipal utility and a secure supply of production steam either by the CHP and/or by a neighboring power plant which we use as a back-up solution. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, capacity limitations of the local waste water treatment plant in Eisenh¨uttenstadt due to technical faults have led to temporary reductions in the containerboard production capacity of our paper machine PM2. Significant future capacity limitations of the local waste water treatment plant or a shutdown of the local waste water treatment plant would require us to reduce or shutdown containerboard production at our paper machine PM2, as there are no alternative local water treatment options. In addition, due to technical faults in the steam pipeline that connects our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt to the neighboring power plant, there is no guarantee that this back-up solution will be available in the event of maintenance or other shutdowns of the CHP.

Future packaging developments and trends may drive further substitution. Substitution is also possible between solidboard packaging and corrugated containers, with the generally lower cost of corrugated containers offset by the moisture and temperature handling characteristics of solidboard packaging. In addition, there has generally been increasing scrutiny of single-use packaging, its sustainability and impact on the environment. While the primary focus of this increasing scrutiny has, so far, been on plastic packaging, there can be no guarantee that paper-based packaging will not also face increasing scrutiny, which may result in regulatory action and/or changes in customer preferences in favor of reusable forms of packaging. Any significant substitution away from paper-based packaging products or from corrugated board to solidboard may adversely affect the demand for our products and therefore our results of operation and profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.8,Price fluctuations in raw materials and our ability to pass on price increases could affect our results of operations.,13.8.1,,"Our margins and overall profitability are significantly affected by the price of raw materials and the length of time it takes us to translate price increases in raw materials and other input costs into prices we charge for third-party sales of containerboard and corrugated board. To the extent our containerboard is sold internally, our profitability will only be affected by the ability to recover any price increases from thirdparty sales of corrugated board to our third party customers in the packaging industry. Furthermore, to the extent that selling prices fall, if we are unable to generate cost savings through producing products more efficiently or lower our fixed costs, our results may be negatively affected. In total, raw materials accounted for 75.2%, 73.5% and 71.6%, respectively, of our cost of materials in the year ended 2017 and 2018 and the first three months of 2019. Our primary raw materials are recycled paper, particularly old corrugated containers, and containerboard. The prices for these raw materials tend to be volatile, and price fluctuations affect our margins. Recycled paper is used in the manufacture of our containerboard products and is purchased in increasingly competitive, price-sensitive markets. Recycled paper has historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality and high price volatility over short periods and may do so again in the future. In particular, the price of recycled paper depends on a variety of factors over which we have no control, including environmental and conservation regulations, natural disasters and weather. A decrease in the supply of such raw materials has caused, and any such decrease in the future can be expected to cause, higher costs of materials. In addition, the increase in demand for products manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled paper has in the past caused an occasional supply or demand imbalance in the market for recycled paper. Chinese purchasers have been in the recycled paper market for a number of years and have become material purchasers in the sector due to significant ongoing expansion of their recycled containerboard mills’ capacity. Other important drivers of recycled paper prices are collection rates of recycled paper as well as freight rates and exchange rates, which both affect the level of exports of recycled paper from Europe to other markets. In the past, significant decreases in the prices for recycled paper have led to a reduction in collection activity, which, in turn, can lead to supply shortages. The effect of these and other factors has been to create volatility with respect to the price of recycled paper, and we expect recycled paper prices to continue to fluctuate based upon supply and demand characteristics. In addition to recycled paper, which we use extensively in our containerboard production at our two mills, we also purchase containerboard from external suppliers as a raw material for our corrugated board production. The prices of containerboard can also be highly volatile. See also ‘‘—Demand for our products _is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity, which is dependent upon factors beyond our_ 29 ----- _control’’ and ‘‘—The cyclical nature of our industry often results in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of operations’’ above, as well as ‘‘—We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations’’ below._ An important driver of recycled paper prices is the balance of supply and demand for paper products in general as well as collection rates of recycled paper. When the price of recycled paper begins to rise, containerboard manufacturers attempt to raise their prices to preserve profit margins, which generally narrow as a result of increased raw material costs. It typically takes approximately two to three months for the containerboard mills to pass on their raw material price increases to the corrugated board manufacturers. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases on to their customers. In particular during periods of rising recycled paper prices, our profitability has therefore historically been adversely affected. However, our ability to pass the costs of our raw materials and other input costs on to our packaging customers depends on a number of other factors, including the supply and demand balance for containerboard and corrugated board in a particular region and the ability of our customers to maintain or increase prices with their own customers. We generate almost all of our sales through purchase orders from our customers based on our price lists which we adjust in response to market price movements and only have very few contracts with our customers which provide minimum purchase obligations and/or pricing clauses that would allow us to automatically pass increased costs on to our customers. As a result of these factors, there can be no guarantee that the price of recycled paper and the prices for our containerboard and corrugated board products will always be closely correlated. Any extended mismatch between the price of recycled paper and the market prices for our products could have a significant effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. For example, between 2009 and 2010, our results of operations and financial condition deteriorated. There were two main reasons for this deterioration. First, the global financial and economic crisis led to a significant drop in the price of recycled paper, our main raw material, in the second half of 2008, but also to a significant decrease in the demand for our products and a corresponding decrease in the market prices for both containerboard and corrugated board. Following the significant drop in the prices for recycled paper in the second half of 2008, the prices for recycled paper started to recover in the first half of 2009, notwithstanding the continuing economic weakness and contrary to historic trends. This, in turn, led to a compression of our margins up to a point during the third quarter of 2009 when the sales prices for some of our finished products were insufficient to cover our variable input costs. As a result, we incurred significant losses and a few of our competitors were forced to close or mothball less efficient production facilities, which led at least temporarily to a drop in market-wide containerboard and corrugated board capacity. Our margins only returned to near sustainable levels towards the end of 2010, following multiple rounds of price increases for recycled paper, containerboard and corrugated board.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

Despite the completion of the CHP Acquisition our production processes are nevertheless reliant on third parties for the supply of energy.

In the past years, this regulatory framework has been subject to substantial change and it will continue to be subject to change in the future. Such change is not only due to legislative reforms, but is also prompted by administrative and judicial decisions. In Germany, where both our mills are located, our energy costs have been strongly impacted by regulatory decisions related to the so-called ‘‘Energiewende’’, a significant shift in government policy following the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan in 2011. This new German energy policy focuses on promoting the development of renewable energy sources and contemplates the complete cessation of the production of nuclear power by 2021. To mitigate the impact of the resulting significant increases in electricity prices for energy-intensive industries, the German government adopted rules that provide for various businesses, including us, to be reimbursed for certain infrastructure investment surcharges necessary for the implementation of the ‘‘Energiewende’’. However, those rules have not only been subject to challenges in German courts and EU scrutiny as potentially illegal subsidies, but also continue to be the subject of political scrutiny by various interest groups. Although the relevant rules have been modified to address certain of these concerns, there is no guarantee that they will not change again or that we will continue to be able to benefit from current accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes. In particular, it cannot be ruled out that the EU may introduce more stringent conditions for any such accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes in the future and/or may further restrict the ability of companies to combine benefits of different reduction schemes (so-called ‘‘cumulation’’). As an ‘‘energy-intensive enterprise’’, we have historically benefitted, and in 2019 we continued to benefit, from considerable reductions of the so-called EEG surcharge (EEG Umlage), a charge which is levied on electricity consumers to fund the financial promotion of renewable energy sources. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and the first three months of 2019, for example, such reductions decreased our energy costs by approximately A28.6 million, A30.4 million, A30.3 million and A7 million, respectively. Other countries in which we operate production facilities or may operate production facilities in the future, may adopt similar policies in order to promote the usage of renewable energy sources. As a consequence thereof, the energy price could increase and there can be no guarantee that we will be reimbursed to the extent to which the price increased, to the same extent as currently in Germany or even at all. This could consequently adversely affect the revenue of our production facility and may force us to adopt capitalintensive countering measures or ultimately close the plant. In addition, we currently benefit from various other privileges and exemptions from energy-related laws and regulations in Germany, including benefits pursuant to § 19 of the German Ordinance on Electricity Network Access Fees (Stromnetzentgeltverordnung), the German Electricity Tax Act (Stromsteuergesetz) and other laws and regulations. Should we lose any or all of these privileges and exemptions, this could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. Finally, compliance with 31 ----- the EU Emission Trading Scheme Directive (the ‘‘ETS’’) could significantly increase our costs. Our two existing mills are, and our proposed third mill (PM3) will be, subject to the ETS. The paper industry was granted the status as a so-called ‘‘Carbon Leakage’’ sector and our existing two mills have therefore been allocated a certain amount of CO2 emission certificates for free. Historically, the collective CO2 allocations granted to our two existing mills have exceeded our collective annual CO2 emissions. The revised ETS Directive for the period 2013-2020, however, has been slowly reversing this excess position over time. The free allocation rules for the fourth trading period (2021-2030), which were adopted in December 2018, still contemplate the allocation of free CO2 emission certificates for Carbon Leakage industries, and the latest Carbon Leakage list for the years 2021-2030 adopted by the European Commission effective as of May 2019 still lists the paper industry as threatened by Carbon Leakage for this upcoming trading period. As a result, we currently expect that our two existing mills and our proposed new mill (PM3) will continue to be allocated at least a portion of the CO2 emission certificates required for their operation free of charge. However, even with these expected free CO2 allocations, there is considerable risk that in the future our costs will significantly increase and will not be recovered through higher prices for our end products.

In addition, certain features of our paper machine project, in particular the proposed closed cycle waste water treatment system, represent ‘‘industry firsts’’, which means that the technology and equipment we are proposing to install are not yet fully proven, at least not on the scale of our proposed paper machine project.

In addition, we currently finance several of our foreign subsidiaries, including subsidiaries outside the euro zone, through borrowings in euro. To reduce (but not eliminate) our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the Polish zloty, Progroup Board sp. z o.o. entered into the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility on December 1, 2015 to pay back euro denominated intra Group loans. To finance the investment in our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, Progroup Board sp. z o.o. entered into the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility on May 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2019, PLN 58.9 million (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A13.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006, which was the exchange rate of the zloty against the euro reported by the National Bank of Poland on March 31, 2019) in borrowings under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding, and PLN 76.0 million (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A17.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006) in borrowings under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the same amounts of borrowings remain outstanding under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility and under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility. The adjusted figures do not reflect PLN 5.4 million and PLN 4.0 million, respectively, in scheduled repayments under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility and the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility we will be required to make on June 30, 2019. For more details about the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, including scheduled repayments on the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing _Senior Secured PLN Facilities’’._ To reduce (but not eliminate) our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the British pound, Progroup Board Ltd. entered into the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility on December 21, 2017. As of March 31, 2019, we had drawn GBP3.0 million under the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A3.495 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = GBP 0.8583, which was the exchange rate of the British pound against the euro reported by the European 34 ----- Central Bank on March 31, 2019). The Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility was fully utilized as of the date of this offering memorandum. For more details about the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility’’. Prior to our refinancing in 2015, we were not permitted under our former financing arrangements to hedge for currency risks. As a result, fluctuations in the value of local currencies against the euro have had, and may have in the future, a significant effect on our operations and on our reported results in euro and the comparability of our performance between financial periods can be significantly affected by fluctuations in local currencies against the euro. We have since started to implement foreign currency risk management in order to monitor our foreign currency risk and to enable us to consider taking action if we decide to do so, but there is no assurance that any such foreign currency risk management will be effective. As a result, fluctuations in the value of these local currencies against the euro may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and on our reported results in euro. The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar is also important for the European containerboard industry, because exports from the European market influence the balance of supply and demand and the price development of containerboard in Europe. Movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rate may also have an effect on trading. A weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has historically resulted in lower (U.S. dollar-denominated) exports by European containerboard manufacturers with a negative (for our business) effect on the supply demand balance and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also resulted in lower sales by other European manufacturers who ship products in corrugated packaging, resulting in lower European demand for corrugated packaging, and therefore for our containerboard and corrugated board. A weak U.S. dollar may also result in additional competition in the European market from U.S. manufacturers that have an incentive to sell more products in Europe, due to increased European demand for the relatively lower-priced U.S. goods over higher-priced European goods.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

In addition to our significant investment in PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, primarily between 2008 and 2010, we have ongoing capital expenditure requirements relating to, among other things, the modernization and maintenance of our existing production plants. Furthermore, we have incurred (and expect to continue to incur) significant 37 ----- capital expenditures in connection with the launch and ramp-up of our corrugated board production sites in Trzcinica, Poland (PW10), Drizzona, Italy (PW11), and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW12), and the ongoing establishment of our proposed corrugated board sites in Eisfeld, Germany (PW13) and our proposed further corrugated board ‘‘mega-plant’’ (PW14) as described above. In the short-term to mid-term, we intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production capacity, and we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020) and currently expect to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023, including a further proposed corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early 2021). We currently expect to make total net investments (i.e. net of expected subsidies) of approximately A60 million and A70-75 million, respectively, for these two additional corrugated board production sites (PW13 and PW14). In addition, we have also begun to actively pursue the realization of a further paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. We currently expect total net investment costs (i.e. net of expected subsidies) of approximately A465 million for just this paper machine project over a several year period, approximately A116.7 million of initial expenditures (e.g. for advance payments for the paper machine and certain preliminary work) we had already incurred as of the end of the first quarter of 2019. For further details on our proposed expansion projects and investment program, see ‘‘Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors affecting our Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’._ Our ability to expand our business and fund our ongoing operations depends on our ability to generate cash and access financing. In addition, our liquidity and capital requirements may increase if we decide to pursue further expansion projects or if we make future acquisitions. We may not generate sufficient cash flow or have access to sufficient funding to meet these requirements. Further, we may require information technology enhancements in order to continue providing high-quality IT support for our production processes. Failure to implement such enhancements may result in reduced quality of processes and loss of orders and customers. If one or more of the aforementioned risks were to materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, even successful expansion (or acquisition) projects can have a negative impact on our profitability in the short-term. For example, our reduced profitability between 2009 and 2010 following the global financial and economic crisis coincided with the launch of production at our corrugated board production sites in Strykow, Poland (PW7) and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW8) and at our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany (PM2), which involved significant start-up and ramp-up costs. The related costs were largely expected and are normal in our industry, but their timing further exacerbated our financial condition. In addition, even in a positive market environment, it typically takes two to three years from the launch of a new corrugated board production site until the production site is fully utilized. For example, we launched our corrugated board production site in Strykow, Poland (PW7) in 2009, but the site only completed its ramp-up phase in 2012 and therefore, did not operate at a three-shift capacity for an entire year until 2013. Our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany commenced production in October 2015 and completed its ramp-up phase in 2017, while our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland completed a very fast and successful ramp-up and will likely already operate at a full, three-shift capacity for an entire year for the first time in 2018. Our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy commenced production in March 2018 and we expect the ramp up of production to continue through the end of 2020. We expect our newest corrugated board ‘‘mega-plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (which commenced production in January 2019), our proposed new corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany and our proposed further corrugated board ‘‘mega-plant’’ (PW14) described above to also undergo ramp-up phases of different durations with a corresponding impact on our result of operations. The start-up and ramp-up costs and short-term to mid-term impact on our profitability of our latest paper machine project (PM3) will be proportionately higher, due to the much larger size, higher level of complexity and longer implementation timeframe of such a project, compared to the establishment of a new corrugated board production site. For our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2), for example, we executed some of the definitive agreements with our main project partners (including the related financing arrangements) as early as the summer of 2008, before starting initial ground works later that year. In addition, even though our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2) commenced operations in March 2010, it only completed its initial ramp-up phase in 2013. Since then, we have been continuing our efforts to further optimize our 38 ----- operations at our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, which involves not only the optimization of the performance of PM2, but also the optimization of connected processes, including the operation of the CHP we acquired from EnBW effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015.

Subject to certain prerequisites, the German interest barrier rules (Zinsschranke) impose certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest for tax purposes. Since 2008, the German interest barrier rules in general have disallowed the deduction of net interest expenses exceeding 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all businesses belonging to the same tax group (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax purposes, _i.e., the Issuer and certain Guarantors, are treated as one single business. Such consolidation is, _inter alia, relevant for the calculation of the tax adjusted EBITDA. There are certain exemptions from the restrictions of the German interest barrier rules allowing for a tax deduction of the entire annual interest expenses, which, however, may not be available to the Issuer. To the extent our net interest expenses exceed 30% of our tax adjusted EBITDA in any given year, we may therefore not be able to deduct the excess in our net interest expense in calculating our taxable earnings for the relevant year. This may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition and on our ability to meet our obligations under the Additional Notes and the Guarantees. 41 ----- Any non-deductible amount of interest expenses exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and may, subject to the interest barrier rules, be deductible in future fiscal years.

Further, as the negotiation process for the exit is still ongoing, there is a great amount of uncertainty on the specific terms to be agreed between the negotiating parties. The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union will take effect on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement, or, unless a further extension is granted, on October 31, 2019 if no agreement is reached by then. The effects of Brexit are uncertain, and Brexit has and may continue to contribute to volatility in the prices of securities of companies located in Europe. An extension of the October 31, 2019 deadline, a second referendum or other developments may result in additional volatility in the financial markets and the European economy. The overall impact of Brexit, especially without a withdrawal agreement, may create further global economic uncertainty. A downturn in the European economy could have adverse effects on our business in the markets in which we operate. In addition, with the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, we have substantially increased our presence in the United Kingdom (a market in which we have historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins), which has increased our exposure to any negative outcomes of Brexit. In 2018 and the first three months of 2019, sales in the United Kingdom accounted for 7.5% and 7.0%, respectively, of our sales by volume. Possible negative outcomes resulting from Brexit include: significantly disrupted trade between the United Kingdom and the EU; political and economic instability in other countries of the EU, which covers the majority of our markets; and instability in the global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the euro and the pound sterling. The depreciation of the pound sterling against the euro has caused, and may continue to cause, an increase in the price of goods in the United Kingdom that are sourced from the EU. Therefore, Brexit might also affect our ability to maintain the current level of sales, as expressed in euros, in the United Kingdom.

The CHP purchase agreement provides us with limited protection against the existence of such problems or the materialization of any such risks. The existence of any such risks or problems could lead to significant additional costs in operating the CHP, require us to incur significant costs for repairs or to make significant additional investments into the CHP in an attempt to remedy such risks or problems. For example, in connection with a scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the third quarter of 2016, we discovered certain technical faults within the CHP that we were not previously aware of. Because of our long-term economic interest in the efficient and uninterrupted (except for necessary maintenance shutdowns we schedule on a regular basis) operation of the CHP, we decided to significantly extend the originally scheduled maintenance shutdown period to allow us to make certain repairs and replace certain faulty components. This decision led to a significantly longer than scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and caused us to incur A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’, including A13.9 million in additional costs as expenditure of exceptional size or incidence and A2.1 million in lost sales in 2016. We may learn additional information about the CHP that adversely affects us in the future, such as unknown or contingent liabilities, technical problems and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws.

201,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.43,Our ability to supply electricity to the public power grid will be dependent upon transmission and distribution systems and our reliance on third parties.,13.43.1,,"The sale and supply of electricity produced by the CHP to the public grid is dependent upon the infrastructure of the local power grid systems. We have no control over the operation of these power grid systems and we must rely on independent third-party power grid system operators. Different companies operate the transmission grids and the distribution grids in Germany. The transmission grid in the region where the CHP is located is operated by E.DIS AG and there are a number of different operators of distribution grids. Any failure of such power grid systems or reduction of available capacity, including as a result of grid congestion, natural disasters, insufficient maintenance or inadequate development, could prevent us from selling and supplying electricity from the CHP. In Germany, grid congestion has recently caused operational issues for certain power generation plants, as the increase of co-generation and renewable energy in Germany that has a priority feed-in right to German power distribution networks has led to a reduction of available grid capacity for conventional power plants. In addition, as these power grid systems are operated by independent third parties who will not be our contractual partners, we will not carry insurance in this regard which would compensate us in the event of an operational failure. Additionally, under the German Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz—EnWG), network operators are responsible for the security and reliability of the power supply system and required to balance differences between generation and consumption. Therefore, if the safety or reliability of the transmission system is endangered, particularly in the case of grid bottlenecks, network operators are required to take remedial grid-related or market-related action, including changes to current electricity feed-in, transit and output. In doing so, under the EnWG and the German Renewable Energies Act _(Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz— EEG), network operators may choose to disconnect power plants from the grid temporarily to reduce or prevent congestion. In any such case, conventional power plants would be the first to be disconnected, followed by co-generation plants and renewable power plants. We would not be entitled to compensation by the network operator for the losses incurred as a consequence of such measures. Due to the nuclear power phase-out and as renewable power generation and cogeneration increases rapidly in Germany and 44 ----- the capacity of affected transmission and distribution grids is often not expanded sufficiently to accommodate this increase, there is an increasing risk of grid congestion and subsequent regulation of feed-in power capacity of conventional power plants during certain hours. Any failure of the power grids or a disconnection of the CHP from the power grid, e.g., due to congestion and respective measures by the network operator, could negatively impact our electricity sales, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

See ‘‘Business—Regulatory _Environment—Regulation governing the Operation of the CHP’’._ The operating costs and results of operations of Progroup Power 1 GmbH and the CHP will be significantly impacted by the relevant regulatory framework for the electricity sector both on the European and the national level. In the past years, this regulatory framework has been subject to substantial change and it will continue to be subject to change in the future. Such change is not only due to legislative reforms, but is also prompted by administrative and judicial decisions. See also ‘‘—Our energy costs, in particular in _Germany, are dependent on the regulatory framework for the electricity sector, which is subject to constant change and, in addition, we may face material cost increases if we lose certain financial privileges which we benefit from in Germany with regard to the Renewable Energies Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’) surcharge and network access fees and other fees’’._ Any such changes, in particular any loss or significant reduction of certain financial privileges we currently enjoy under the German Renewable Energies Act or the German Ordinance on Electricity Network Access Fees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As another example, the fluidized bed boiler (Wirbelschichtkessel) of the CHP for the thermal utilization of refuse-derived fuels currently benefits from an exemption under the CO2 emissions trading scheme under the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act _(Treibhausgas- _Emissionshandelsgesetz, ‘‘TEHG’’). A partial or outright loss of this exemption, as a result of either the_ CHP Acquisition or legal changes in the future, would result in significant additional administrative expenses as well as costs for purchasing CO2 emission certificates. Any further tightening of general emission limits under relevant EU or German laws and regulations may require us to incur significant capital expenditure and ensure continued compliance by the CHP with all relevant laws and regulations. Since the CHP primarily uses refuse-derived fuels (including processed household and commercial waste), the operation of the CHP is particularly tightly regulated and is subject to a high level of regulatory scrutiny. Any breach of emissions limits under applicable laws and regulations, for example, due to equipment malfunction or a failure of the procedures for screening the waste before it is being incinerated, may force us to temporarily shut down the CHP or cause the relevant regulators to impose administrative sanctions and/or modify the operating permits for the CHP, which could result in significant costs. In addition, the reduction or elimination of certain energy-related tax credits and exemptions or other changes in tax laws, in particular under the German Electricity Tax Act (Stromsteuergesetz—StromStG) and the German Energy Tax Act (Energiesteuergesetz—Energie StG), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, we may be adversely affected by any regulatory changes that may favor recycling over the thermal utilization of the refusederived fuels used in the operation of the CHP. For example, certain counties (Landkreise) in which one of our suppliers of refuse-derived fuels operates have recently adopted a new scheme for the collection of certain recyclables and organic waste. As a result of this change, other regulatory changes or similar developments in other regions, the amount and quality of household waste our supplier will be able to collect will likely decrease which will make it more difficult for our supplier to supply us with the agreed amount of refuse-derived fuels under the supply agreement, it may become more difficult to obtain the required quality and/or quantities of refuse-derived fuels to ensure the operation of the CHP in the future and/or the waste disposal fees we are able to charge for the thermal utilization of the refuse-derived fuels may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we are subject to various compliance, reporting and audit requirements under applicable laws and regulations, which require us to incur additional costs, including for the services of external 45 ----- advisers. Under the German Energy Services Act (EDLG), for example, certain larger companies are required to carry out an energy audit, unless they have implemented an energy management system (EnMS). Since the CHP has implemented an EnMS, it is currently exempt from the energy audit requirement. However, the requirements of the EDLG also apply to current members of the Group and the Issuer as well as certain of its subsidiaries will still be required to carry out an energy audit under the EDLG.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union have been conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the ‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR, WIBOR, PRIBOR, BUBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and/or EURIBOR).

If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Guarantees (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on the part of the Security Agent. In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement, diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Guarantees. 56 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders _upon a Change of Control’’. The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for_ additional financing to pay these amounts when they become due. The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a change of control event would result in an event of default under the Notes.

We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions in our other then-existing contractual obligations may also restrict us from making such required repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of our then-existing indebtedness, and the repurchase of the Notes, pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness even if the change of control itself does not. The change of control provision contained in the Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘change of control’’ as defined in the Conditions of Issue. The definition of ‘‘change of control’’ contained in the Conditions of Issue includes a disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a limited body of case law in some jurisdictions interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all’’, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under law and there is no German case law interpreting ‘‘all or substantially all’’ in the context of terms and conditions of high yield notes or other debt instruments. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Since we commenced operations in 1992, we have carefully selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a greenfield strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we operate. As a result, we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high technological standards, resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and relatively low requirements for additional capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the high technological standards of our production facilities, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for light-weight packaging, (ii) the increasing importance of small-size packaging due to the growing importance of e-commerce, and (iii) the general trend towards a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and energy, which can help reduce costs, CO2 emissions and fresh water consumption. Our core business comprises Paper and Board. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible containerboard production using almost exclusively recycled paper, with high output volumes to increase cost efficiency and short delivery times. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and the first three months of 2019, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for most of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and the ability of Board to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. In addition, our customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options. Paper manufactures containerboard at our two paper mills in Germany, with an envisaged total annual production capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons of containerboard. Our two existing paper machines, PM1 in Burg and PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, have complementary production layouts which allow us to produce brown containerboard with grammages between 60-230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recycled paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the appropriate widths for Board’s ten existing corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a total annual production capacity of approximately 1,440,000 tons of corrugated board, including our latest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) at Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom. Our historic greenfield location strategy ensures close customer proximity and high production flexibility. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we further acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH, the combined heat and power plant (the ‘‘CHP’’) adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and certain related assets (the ‘‘CHP Acquisition’’). As a result thereof, we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves (‘‘Power’’). In 2018, we sold approximately 1,151,000 tons of corrugated board and approximately 176,000 tons of containerboard to external customers across Europe, resulting in external corrugated board and containerboard sales, respectively, of A840.0 million (86.9% of total sales) and A84.5 million (8.7% of total sales). Paper’s total sales in 2018 include A17.9 million (1.9% of total sales) in revenues from the sale of electricity and revenues from the incineration of refuse-derived fuel resulting from the integration of the CHP as well as A9.7 million (1.0% of total sales) in sales from passing purchased fuel costs to Sales and 70 ----- Solutions GmbH. Total external sales by Board and Paper in 2018 (including sales other than corrugated board or containerboard sales, respectively) amounted to A840.8 million (87.0% of total sales) and A112.9 million (11.7% of total sales). Our total sales and EBITDA in 2018 amounted to A966.1 million and A275.5 million, respectively. Sales in Germany (origin), our core market, accounted for 55.8% of total sales and 42.0% of sales by volume in 2018.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

201,Offerings 2019.md,1165,KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,1165.1,"Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input Costs",1165.1.1,,"_Fluctuations in Demand and Industry Capacity_ Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity. Increased levels of economic growth and activity typically result in higher per capita use of packaging materials, both with respect to transportation of goods and consumer presentation. This increase in the use of packaging materials (including paper-based packaging materials), in turn, results in an increase in the demand for our recycled containerboard and corrugated board products. Because the markets for containerboard and corrugated board products in the developed economies in which we primarily operate are generally mature, historically there has been a close correlation between general economic growth and demand for packaging products such as corrugated containers and, therefore, for their component materials such as containerboard and corrugated board. Less developed economies, including those in Eastern Europe, have a lower per capita consumption of packaging materials and therefore also of containerboard and corrugated board products but also, as a result, have the potential for higher growth as per capita consumption of packaging materials increases towards levels of developed economies. To a lesser degree, demand for corrugated containers and their component materials, including our containerboard and corrugated board, is affected by changes in their market prices. Significant increases in the price of corrugated containers have, on occasion, resulted in decreased demand as end-customers elected to purchase substitute products, such as reusable plastic containers, wooden crates or shrink-wrap. Historically, prices for containerboard and corrugated board have tended to be cyclical. This cyclicality has resulted from significant imbalances in supply and demand for containerboard. On the one hand, containerboard production capacity cannot be readily adapted to reflect changing market conditions due to the high capital intensity of paper production facilities and the long lead time between the planning and construction of a new containerboard mill. On the other hand, significant containerboard and corrugated board price reductions and inventory growth have resulted when capacity has exceeded demand. In the past, many leading paper manufacturers have reacted to reduced demand by taking downtime and by rationalizing high-cost and inefficient capacity. _Fluctuations in Raw Material Costs_ Because the primary raw material for the production of recycled containerboard is recycled paper, the price of which tends to fluctuate, our two recycled containerboard mills (i.e., our paper machines PM1 and PM2) can experience temporary increases and decreases in profits. Except for the period between 2009 and 2010 following the financial and economic crisis, our paper mill in Burg (PM1) has historically generated a relatively stable margin, in part because we primarily sell our containerboard to our own corrugated board plants. As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production capacity in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have increased to approximately 82% (or 93%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of the total sales, by volume, of Paper in 2018. With the fast and successful ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019,, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. As we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020) and plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2019 and 2021 (including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early 2021), we expect to successively increase this net short position with regard to containerboard even further at least in the short-term to mid-term. We therefore currently do not expect 72 ----- the volume of our external containerboard sales to significantly increase again unless and until we complete our proposed further paper machine project (PM3). For more details on our expansion projects and investment program, see also’’—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ below. Our overall profitability is also affected by the length of time it takes us to translate price increases in raw materials and other input costs into prices we charge for third-party sales of containerboard and corrugated board. To the extent our containerboard is sold internally, our profitability will only be affected by the ability to recover any price increases from third-party sales of corrugated board to our third party customers in the packaging industry. Furthermore, to the extent that selling prices fall, if we are unable to generate cost savings through producing products more efficiently or lower our fixed costs, our results may be negatively affected. An important driver of recycled paper prices is the balance of supply and demand for paper products in general as well as collection rates of recycled paper. When the price of recycled paper increases, containerboard manufacturers attempt to raise their prices to preserve profit margins, which generally narrow as a result of higher raw material costs. It typically takes approximately two to three months for mills to pass on their raw material price increases to corrugated board manufacturers. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for these manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases on to their customers. In a down cycle, as recycled paper prices fall, manufacturers of paper and paper-based packaging products (including manufacturers of containerboard and corrugated board) attempt to maintain prices. In the past, we have typically been able to maintain our prices for two to three months in such a down cycle. As a result, the effect of price fluctuations on our mills and corrugated board operations varies, depending on the relevant point in the industry cycle. During periods of rising containerboard prices, our profitability can therefore be adversely affected. Conversely, during periods of declining containerboard prices, our profitability can be positively affected. However, our ability to pass the costs of our raw materials and other input costs on to our packaging customers depends on a number of other factors, including the supply and demand balance for containerboard and corrugated board in a particular region and the ability of our customers to maintain or increase prices with their own customers. We generate almost all of our sales through purchase orders from our customers based on our price lists which we adjust in response to market price movements and only have very few contracts with our customers which provide minimum purchase obligations and/or pricing clauses that would allow us to automatically pass increased costs on to our customers. As a result of these factors, there can be no guarantee that the price of recycled paper and the prices for our containerboard and corrugated board products will always be closely correlated. Any extended mismatch between the price of recycled paper and the market prices for our products could have a significant effect on our margins and overall profitability. For example, between 2009 and 2010, our results of operations and financial condition deteriorated. There were two main reasons for this deterioration. First, the global financial and economic crisis led to a significant drop in the price of recycled paper in the second half of 2008, followed by a significant decrease in the demand for our products and a corresponding decrease in the market prices for both containerboard and corrugated board. Following the significant drop in the prices for recycled paper in the second half of 2008, the prices for recycled paper started to recover in the first half of 2009, notwithstanding the continuing economic weakness and contrary to historic trends. This, in turn, led to a compression of our margins during the third quarter of 2009 when the sales prices for some of our finished products were insufficient to cover our variable input costs. As a result, we incurred significant losses and a few of our competitors were forced to close or mothball less efficient production facilities, which led at least temporarily to a drop in market-wide containerboard and corrugated board capacity. Our margins only returned to more sustainable levels towards the end of 2010, following multiple price increases for recycled paper, containerboard and corrugated board. Conversely, due to a combination of (i) a higher level of integration between our containerboard and corrugated board businesses, (ii) positive effects from measures we took as part of our Continuous Improvement Program and the immediate measures we took at the time in response to the deterioration of our results of operations and financial condition, and (iii) sustained economic growth in Germany in 2014 and 2015, we were able to increase the average selling price for both our containerboard and corrugated board products in 2014 and 2015, while the price of recycled paper generally remained stable throughout 2014 and only moderately increased in the second and third quarters of 2015, which had a significant positive impact on our margins and general profitability. 73 ----- During the course of 2016, corrugated board and containerboard prices slowly and steadily decreased from 2015 price levels. At the same time prices for recycled paper increased throughout the first three quarters of 2016, before decreasing slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result, following a strong improvement in our operating results in 2014 and 2015, we experienced a leveling of our operating results in 2016. Due to strong demand, especially from Asia, prices for recycled paper were significantly higher during 2017 compared to 2016, especially during the first half of 2017. The average price per ton for recycled paper grades we purchased was approximately A150 during 2017, compared to A130 during 2016. During the third quarter of 2017, however, prices for recycled paper started to gradually decline again, a trend which continued through the end of 2017, in part as a result of policy changes and stricter import controls in China, which resulted in decreasing recycled paper exports to China. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the average price per ton for recycled paper grades we purchased was approximately A142 per ton, compared to A136 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016. Partly as a result of the increases in recycled paper prices, prices for recycled containerboard in Europe also steadily increased again during the course of 2017. The average prices for our containerboard increased from A376 per ton (for the overall product portfolio mix sold externally) during 2016 to A413 per ton during 2017. During the course of 2017, we were able to achieve aggregate price increases for our containerboard of A90-100 per ton in total, which are not fully reflected in the average sales figures. On the other hand, the average price per ton for the containerboard we were required to purchase externally also increased in 2017. Party as a result of the increases in recycled containerboard prices, corrugated board prices also increased again during 2017, following the increases in containerboard prices with a slight time lag. During the course of 2017, the average prices for our corrugated board increased from approximately A634 per ton during 2016 to A657 per ton during 2017. During the course of 2017, we were able to achieve aggregate price increases for our corrugated board products of A90-100 per ton in total, which are not fully reflected in the average sales figures. Due to decreases in demand from outside Europe, resource price levels for recycled paper declined in the first and second quarter of 2018. Since then, prices for recycled paper remained at a favorable level for the rest of the year. The average price per ton for recycled paper grades we purchased was approximately A108 during 2018, compared to A150 during 2017. In the first three months of 2019, the purchasing price for recycled paper remained at an almost stable low price point. On the other hand, prices for both corrugated board and containerboard increased in the first quarter of 2018, remaining elevated for the remainder of the year but with a slight trend towards normalisation in the fourth quarter. The average prices for our containerboard increased from A413 per ton (for the overall product portfolio mix sold externally) during 2017 to A480 per ton during 2018, while the average price per ton for the containerboard we were required to purchase externally also increased in 2018. After a continuously upward trend in 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, prices for recycled containerboard were primarily stable in the second and third quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, prices for recycled containerboard started to decline. This development usually follows the price development of recycled paper. In 2018, we observed an opposite development since purchasing prices for recycled paper declined in the first and second quarter of 2018 and remained at a low level for the rest of the year 2018. Corrugated board prices increased again during 2018, following the increases in containerboard prices with a slight time lag. During the course of 2018, the average prices for our corrugated board increased 11.1% from approximately A657 per ton during 2017 to A730 per ton during 2018. Following the containerboard market price development, prices for corrugated board increased since March 2017. In March and April 2018, the earlier containerboard price increase was passed on to the corrugated board customers, which led to a price peak in May and a slightly decreasing trend since the beginning of the third quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, both containerboard and corrugated board experienced a considerable price normalization, i.e. prices for both containerboard and corrugated board started to decline. Due to the typical time lags in passing on price developments to customers, we expect this normalization of containerboard and corrugated board price levels to further negatively impact our performance in 2019. In the short-to-mid term, we anticipate further potential downward price adjustments as part of the ongoing normalization of the market conditions, which is likely to have a negative impact on our margins and EBITDA. _Fluctuations in Energy Costs_ Another important input for us is energy. Our production processes, in particular the production of containerboard at our two mills, are energy intensive. In 2008, we entered into certain framework and 74 ----- ancillary agreements with EnBW for the supply of steam to PM2 via the CHP, which reduced our exposure to fluctuations in gas prices. As described in more detail under ‘‘—The CHP Acquisition’’ below, effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH from EnBW, the CHP and certain related assets outright. As a result thereof, we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves. The completion of the CHP Acquisition constituted a significant milestone in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and allowed us to significantly reduce our energy costs. However, our production processes are nevertheless reliant on third parties for the supply of energy. Market prices for energy, in particular for electricity, oil and natural gas, have historically been volatile and have had a corresponding effect on our production costs. As a result, we have undertaken significant efforts in recent years to decrease our energy consumption and costs throughout our business. For further information, see ‘‘Business—Procurement/Purchasing—Energy’’ and ‘‘Business—Sustainability Focus; Research and Development’’. The key drivers of our energy expenses have been, and will continue to be, fluctuations in the market prices for energy, the performance of the CHP adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt as well as regulatory decisions. Any extended shutdowns of the CHP may have a negative impact on our results of operations. For example, a longer than scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 resulted in A16.0 million in items of exceptional size or incidence, including A13.9 million in exceptional expenses and A2.1 million in lost sales. In addition, in Germany, our core market, energy prices have been strongly impacted by regulatory decisions related to the so-called ‘‘Energiewende’’, a significant shift in government policy following the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan in 2011. The energy policy in Germany focuses on promoting the development of renewable energy sources and contemplates the complete cessation of the production of nuclear power by 2021. To mitigate the impact of the resulting significant increases in electricity prices for energy-intensive industries, the German government adopted rules that provide for various businesses, including us, to be reimbursed for certain infrastructure investment surcharges necessary for the implementation of the ‘‘Energiewende’’. However, those rules have not only been subject to challenges in German courts and EU scrutiny as potentially illegal subsidies, but also continue to be the subject of political scrutiny by various interest groups. Although the relevant rules have been modified to address certain of these concerns, there is no guarantee that they will not change again or that we will continue to be able to benefit from current accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes. Notwithstanding increases in production volumes, our energy costs have declined in recent years for a variety of reasons, including (i) our efforts to reduce energy consumption, in particular with regard to PM2, (ii) falling energy prices, (iii) the optimization of our energy procurement processes, (iv) the optimization of the operating costs of the CHP, in particular with regard to ash disposal, as well as (v) the full utilization of all available accommodations, credits and refunds under applicable energy laws and regulations. For more information about our energy management efforts, see ‘‘—Sustainability Focus; _Research and Development’’. Fluctuations in Freight/Logistics Costs_ Our production operations require us to coordinate and monitor complex logistics processes between each step of our internal value chain and our production processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and products. This includes the shipment of large rolls of containerboard from our two paper mills in Germany to our ten corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom as well as the shipment of our finished corrugated board to our customers in the packaging industry (box plants). We meet our freight and logistics requirements mainly through the use of external logistics companies and, to a much lesser extent, our own fleet of currently 59 trucks. Due to the relatively large size and weight of our products compared to value, freight and logistics expenses play an important role in our business, and fluctuations in freight prices can have a significant impact on our profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

For more details about the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, including scheduled repayments on the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities’’. To reduce (but not eliminate) our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the British pound, Progroup Board Ltd. entered into the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility on December 21, 2017. As of March 31, 2019, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility was fully utilized with drawings of GBP3 million (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A3.5 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = GBP 0.8583, which was the exchange rate of the British pound against the euro reported by the European Central Bank on March 31, 2019). The Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility was fully utilized as of the date of this offering memorandum. For more details about the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility’’. Prior to 2015, we were not permitted under our former financing arrangements to hedge for currency risks. As a result, fluctuations in the value of local currencies against the euro have had, and may have in the future, a significant effect on our operations and on our reported results in euro and the comparability of our performance between financial periods can be significantly affected by fluctuations in local currencies against the euro. We have since started to implement foreign currency risk management in order to monitor our foreign currency risk and to enable us to consider taking action if we decide to do so, but there is no assurance that such measures will be effective. The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar is also important for the European containerboard industry, because exports from the European market influence the balance of supply and demand and the price development of containerboard in Europe. Movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rate may also have an effect on trading, because a strong U.S. dollar tends to make U.S. dollar exports less competitive, while a weak euro may create export opportunities for European containerboard producers, which can reduce containerboard supplies in the European market and promote price stability. Conversely, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has historically resulted in lower (U.S. dollar-denominated) exports by European containerboard manufacturers with a negative (for our business) effect on the supply and demand balance and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also resulted in lower sales by other European manufacturers who ship products in corrugated packaging, resulting in lower European demand for corrugated packaging and, therefore, for our containerboard and corrugated board. A weak U.S. dollar may also result in additional competition in the European market from U.S. manufacturers that have an incentive to sell more products in Europe, due to increased European demand for the relatively lowerpriced U.S. goods over higher-priced European goods.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production capacity in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have increased from approximately 62% (or 67%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to approximately 82% (or 93%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2018. With the fast and successful ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland during 2017 and early 2018, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the 76 ----- new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. As we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020) and plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023 (including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early 2021), we expect to successively increase this net short position with regard to containerboard even further at least in the short-term. We therefore currently do not expect the volume of our external containerboard to significantly increase again unless and until we complete our proposed further paper machine project (PM3) in the second half of 2020. For more details on our expansion projects and investment program, see also’’—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ below With an envisaged total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons, Paper produced approximately 1,020,000 tons and 1,035,000 tons of containerboard in 2018 and 2016, respectively. In 2018, approximately 811,000 tons were sold internally to Board (2016: 738,000 tons of internal containerboard sales), and a further approximately 111,500 tons were sold pursuant to swap agreements with other containerboard producers (2016: 106,000 tons of sales to swap partners), which allow us to reduce transportation costs, optimize our production program and swap internally produced containerboard for certain containerboard grades we do not produce in sufficient quantities, such as kraftliner. The remaining approximately 64,000 tons of containerboard we sold in 2018 were sold externally (2016: approximately 198,000 tons of external containerboard sales, excluding sales to swap partners). With a total annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,440,000 tons (including (i) 100,000 tons of capacity of our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, which commenced production in early March 2018 and (ii) more than 200,000 tons of capacity of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, which commenced production in January 2019) as of the date of this offering memorandum (2016: total annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,130,000 tons), Board produced approximately 1,151,000 tons of containerboard in 2018, compared to approximately 930,000 tons of corrugated board in 2016. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. At the same time, we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or improve our overall Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared to corrugated board margins) of certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options. The steady increase in the degree of vertical integration between Paper and Board over the last few years has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply chain.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,1165,KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,1165.4,Expansion Projects and Investment Program,1165.4.1,,"To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe in the long-term and to allow us to successfully meet ongoing and expected future market growth and the requirements of our customers with regard to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of our production facilities as part of our long-term ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy. In addition to further capacity expansion, our ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy, among other things, also contemplates a gradual technological transition and generation change away from the use of corrugators with a trim width of 2.5m, which are installed and currently in use at some of our older corrugated board production sites, to the use of more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our corrugated board production sites. Following the successful completion of the ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which commenced production in October 2015, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals in 2016 and were already operating within our target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. However, in the short-term to mid-term, we still intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market opportunities for profitable growth, similar to those that led to the successful establishment of our most recent production sites (PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12) in Pl¨ossberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland), Drizzona (Italy) and Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom). In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we 77 ----- intend to primarily achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion opportunities via greenfield projects. In addition to the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland during 2017 and early 2018 following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, we commenced production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, in early March 2018 and at our newest corrugated production site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, in January 2019. As with our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany and our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we established our production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of a customer, Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l., which allows us to supply this new customer largely without freight and other logistics costs. The commencement of production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 100,000 tons, also marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. With a total investment of approximately A85-90 million into the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom to replace our now decommissioned corrugated board production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers from the new site, we have now also become a significant player in the UK market. This newest corrugated board production site operates with a 3.35m trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), which we established in 2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width. We believe that the new production site, with its large capacity and state-of-the-art equipment, is one of the largest and most efficient corrugated sheet board plants globally and positions us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we have historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins. While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including the three packaging park projects (PW9, PW10 and PW11), our newest corrugated board production site (PW12) in the United Kingdom as well as the proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW13 and PW14), we are also evaluating and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire attractive assets from competitors which would complement our existing network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our corrugated board production capacity and meet the other internal investment and financing criteria described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our relationships with certain large and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with significant new customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers. With the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. In the short-term to mid-term, we nevertheless intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated board production capacity. We have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020. We expect to make total net investments (net of subsidies) of approximately A60 million at this site, which is slightly higher than our earlier estimates of approximately A50 million. This cost increase primarily relates to additional investments which will increase the annual corrugated board production capacity of the new site to approximately 175,000 tons, from the originally proposed capacity of approximately 140, 000 tons. Higher than originally expected civil engineering costs (due to the booming construction sector) also contributed to the expected overall cost increase. In addition, we plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023, including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14), which we expect will operate with a 3.35m trim width and have an annual corrugated board production capacity of up to 215,000 tons. We expect to invest approximately A70-75 million into this new plant, which will have capabilities similar to our ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and, we envisage, will commence 78 ----- production in late 2020 or early 2021. Primarily to fund our expected investments into this new site, we entered into the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, with total commitments of A75 million. For more details about these New Senior Secured Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior _Secured Erste Bank Facility’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’. As a_ result of these proposed additional corrugated board production sites, we expect our annual corrugated board production capacity to increase from approximately 3.0 billion square meters (including our corrugated board production sites (PW11 and PW12) in Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom) to approximately 4.2 billion square meters. Furthermore, in order to preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner in sufficient quantities to meet the majority of the sourcing requirements of the expanding corrugated board production within Board, we have also begun to actively pursue the realization of a further paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. Earthworks for the new paper machine already started in January 2019 and, subject (among other things) to obtaining the missing regulatory approvals and construction proceeding according to plan, we currently expect this further state-of-the-art paper machine to start production in the second half of 2020, with a total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 750,000 tons. Following completion of the ramp-up phase of this potential further paper mill, this would mean an increase of the total annual containerboard capacity of Paper from currently approximately 1,100,000 tons to approximately 1,850,000 tons. The new paper machine (PM3) will have a 9.2m trim width, which would allow us to optimize containerboard production to meet the requirements of the more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our newer corrugated board production sites, which would result in low volumes of cutting scrap and higher productivity. Once PM3 has commenced operations, we also plan for further specialization of our then three paper machines which we expect will further enhance the productivity of all our paper machines as each paper mill will be able to focus on clearly defined paper grades. We currently expect total net investment costs (i.e. net of expected subsidies) of approximately A465 million for this new paper machine project over a several year period, including approximately A116.7 million of initial expenditures (e.g. for advance payments for the paper machine and certain preliminary work) we had already incurred as of the end of the first quarter of 2019. We expect to fund any such investments with a combination of cash generated from our operating activities and additional borrowings, including drawings under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility. The currently expected total net investment costs of approximately A465 million in connection with the proposed establishment of our newest paper mill (PM3) significantly exceed our earlier estimates of A375-400 million, primarily due to certain additional strategic and value accretive investments we decided to make, which we expect to have significant economical as well as ecological benefits once the new paper mill will be operational. A large portion of the increase in the expected total net investment costs relates to investments into more energy-efficient components as part of our overall waste-heat concept from the new paper mill. The installation of these components is not legally mandated, but we expect it will result in significant cost savings in the mid- to long-term as well as a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 151,000 tons per year. In addition, we decided to install a closed cycle waste water treatment system. Once our new paper mill is operating at the full intended capacity of 750,000 tons of containerboard, we expect that this closed cycle waste water treatment system will help us to avoid approximately 3,775,000 m[3] of waste water per year, cut the fresh water consumption of the new paper mill by 3,750,000 m[3] and reduce CO2 emissions by approximately a further 19,900 tons per year. At full capacity, the system is expected to produce approximately 65,000,000 kWh per year of bio gas as part of the waste water treatment process. The paper mill will use this bio gas in connection with its production process, cutting its natural gas consumption by approximately 7-8%. We further believe that the proposed closed cycle waste water system will minimize our reliance on third party waste water treatment facilities (which have led to capacity constraints at our existing paper machine (PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany in the past) and result in significant related cost savings in the future. We further decided to install (i) a steam turbine which will allow us to produce a portion of the electricity requirements of the new paper mill in an environmentally friendly manner and (ii) a direct rail connection, which will give us the option to ship a portion of our future production in an environmentally friendly manner by rail and, we believe, result in savings of freight cost and other operational benefits. An increase in the expected costs of the necessary civil engineering works, due to the booming construction sector, also contributed to the overall increase in the expected total net investment costs. 79 ----- Even successful expansion (or acquisition) projects can have a negative impact on our profitability in the short-term. For example, our reduced profitability between 2009 and 2010 following the global financial and economic crisis coincided with the launch of production at our corrugated board production sites in Strykow, Poland (PW7) and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW8) and at our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany (PM2), which involved significant start-up and ramp-up costs. The related costs were largely expected and are normal in our industry, but their timing further exacerbated our financial condition. In addition, even in a positive market environment, it typically takes two to three years from the launch of a new corrugated board production site until the production site is fully utilized. For example, we launched our corrugated board production site in Strykow, Poland (PW7) in 2009, but the site only completed its ramp-up phase in 2012 and therefore, did not operate at a three-shift capacity for an entire year until 2013. Our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany commenced production in October 2015 and completed its ramp-up phase in 2017, while our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland completed a very fast and successful ramp-up and will likely operate at a full, three-shift capacity for an entire year for the first time in 2018. Our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy commenced production in March 2018 and we expect the ramp up of production to continue through the end of 2020. We expect our newest corrugated board production site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (which commence production in January 2019) and our proposed new corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany and proposed further corrugated board ‘‘mega-plant’’ (PW14) described above to also undergo ramp-up phases of different durations with a corresponding impact on our result of operations. The start-up and ramp-up costs and short-term to mid-term impact on our profitability of our latest paper machine project (PM3) will be proportionately higher, due to the much larger size, higher level of complexity and longer implementation timeframe of such a project, compared to the establishment of a new corrugated board production site. For our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2), for example, we executed some of the definitive agreements with our main project partners (including the related financing arrangements) as early as the summer of 2008, before starting initial ground works later that year. In addition, even though our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2) commenced operations in March 2010, it only completed its initial ramp-up phase in 2013. Since then, we have been continuing our efforts to further optimize our operations at our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, which involves not only the optimization of the performance of PM2, but also the optimization of connected processes, including the operation of the CHP we acquired from EnBW effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015.

As already described in more detail above, apart from a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (for which we have already commence construction and expect test production to start in the fourth quarter in 2019 or the first quarter of 2020), we currently expect to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023.

We believe that targeted external containerboard purchases that meet the specific sourcing requirements of Board will give us additional flexibility and provide us with opportunities to further optimize (i.e., minimize) our variable costs, for example, by allowing us to purchase containerboard that matches the specific grade and optimal trim-width required for our corrugated board production from time to time, from external suppliers located in close proximity to the relevant Board plants.

Other major cost items, such as personnel expenses, are the subject of annual increases, and the costs of energy and freight, which are also significant expenses, have partly trended upwards. In order to maintain profitability throughout the economic cycle, we have implemented a comprehensive profitability improvement program (the ‘‘Continuous Improvement Program’’) to ensure the long-term success of our Group. Our Continuous Improvement Program focuses on (i) improving the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities, (ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and (iii) stabilizing our specific fixed costs in order to achieve sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost leaders in our industry.

As a result thereof, we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves. The completion of the CHP Acquisition constituted a significant milestone in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and allowed us to significantly reduce our energy costs. However, following completion of the CHP Acquisition, we are bearing certain additional risks associated with the ownership and operation of the CHP that were previously being borne by EnBW. In connection with a scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the third quarter of 2016, for example, we discovered certain technical faults within the CHP that we were not previously aware of. See also ‘‘Risk _Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and our Business—We could be exposed to risks related to the CHP which have not been detected during the due diligence process preceding the CHP Acquisition’’. Because of our_ long-term economic interest in the efficient and uninterrupted (except for necessary maintenance shutdowns we schedule on a regular basis) operation of the CHP, we decided to significantly extend the originally scheduled maintenance shutdown period to allow us to make certain repairs and replace certain faulty components. This decision led to a significantly longer than scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and caused us to incur A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’, including A13.9 million in additional costs as expenditure of exceptional size or incidence and A2.1 million in lost sales. We took this decision in the expectation that it would reduce the risk of future unscheduled shutdowns related to the faulty components, which could have resulted in even higher costs in the future. There were no significant unscheduled shutdowns of the CHP in 2017, 2018 or the first three months of 2019. There can be no guarantee that will be able to realize any cash savings as a result of the CHP Acquisition in future periods. For example, there can be no guarantee that the actual annual personnel expenses, repair and maintenance costs and insurance costs for the CHP will not be higher than previously estimated, that these expenses will not increase further in the future or that the actual requirements for capital investments per annum will not be higher than our previous estimates. Furthermore, following completion of the CHP Acquisition, we became directly responsible for, and we are now bearing all risks related to, the ownership and day-to-day operation of the CHP, which includes the risk of any further unexpected repair costs, the risk of any further significant unscheduled or longer than scheduled shutdowns of the CHP, the operational risks associated with the disposal of the ash generated by the CHP (i.e., that we are unable to 81 ----- procure the proper disposal of the ash and may therefore be forced to shut down the CHP) as well as certain other operational and regulatory risks.

Our mills primarily supply the containerboard we produce to Group-owned corrugated board plants; however, only third-party sales are reflected in our revenue. We also sell, to a lesser degree, containerboard to third parties. In 2018, corrugated board sales and external containerboard sales accounted for 86.9% and 8.7%, respectively, of our total sales. Key factors that affect our operating results are: - changes in demand and industry production capacity; - the cost of recycled paper, other raw materials and other costs of manufacturing; - changes in energy costs, both as a result of market price movements and regulatory changes, including energy tax refund schemes and other statutory accommodations for energy intensive industries; - changes in freight and transportation costs; - our ability to pass on price increases in raw materials and other input costs into the prices we charge for third-party sales of containerboard and corrugated board; - the performance and the utilization of our production sites as well as the performance of certain facilities owned and operated by us, such as the CHP; - the level of vertical integration between Paper and Board; - currency exchange rate movements; - our ability to achieve cost savings; and - our ability to successfully complete ongoing and future expansion projects. 71 ----- Because many of these factors are beyond our control and certain of these factors have historically been volatile, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance and it is difficult to predict future performance with any degree of certainty.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

This increase in sales was primarily attributable to a significant increase in corrugated board sales, both in Germany and abroad, which significantly exceeded general market growth. Total corrugated board sales increased by A176.0 million or 26.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. Corrugated board sales volumes increased strongly by approximately 140,000 tons, from approximately 1,011,000 tons in 2017 to approximately 1,151,000 tons in 2018. This significant increase in sales volumes was attributable to (i) the successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, (ii) the successful (but on-going) ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, following commencement of commercial production in March 2018 (iii) our ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities as part of our Continuous Improvement Program as well as (iv) our continuing efforts to further optimize production of our corrugated board plants. See also ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of _Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ and ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Continuous Improvement Program’’ above. At the same time, our total containerboard sales_ volume slightly decreased by approximately 31,000 tons or 3.1%, from approximately 1,018,000 tons in 2017 to approximately 987,000 tons in 2018, primarily due to deliberate build-up of inventories. External sales of containerboard significantly decreased by approximately 66,000 tons or 27.2% from approximately 242,000 tons in 2017 to approximately 176,000 tons in 2018 as we managed to further increase the share of internal containerboard sales to our corrugated board operations within Board. This was due to further improved utilization of our existing corrugated board production sites, the successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland as well as the successful (but ongoing) ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy. As a result, the average grade of integration between Paper and Board, including swap agreements, increased from 87% in 2017 to 93% in 2018. The average price of corrugated board in 2018 was significantly above the average price of 2017 (+11.1%). During the course of 2017 and the first half of 2018, price level for corrugated board increased following the recycled containerboard’s price development. The average price per ton for externally sold containerboard in 2018 was significantly above the average price in 2017 (+16.4%), which also had a positive impact on our total sales in 2018. After a continuously upward trend during 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, prices for recycled containerboard were primarily stable in the second and third quarter of 2018 and declined in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Extraordinary income in 2018 includes, among other things, a release of provisions for finance costs and indemnity claims against EnBW in relation to additional tax payments regarding the fiscal year 2013. The income from EnBW relates to certain tax indemnities we received from EnBW in connection with the CHP Acquisition which cover tax liabilities with regard to periods prior to the acquisition date.

Contrary effects came from lower income from other periods which increased by A0.7 million or 5.6% from A12.6 million in 2017 to A13.3 million in 2018, primarily due to a different timing of refunds for grid charges and energy taxes. Income from exchange rate differences also decreased by A1.0 million or 25.5% from A3.9 million in 2017 to A2.9 million in 2018. Income from investment subsidies amounted to A0.3 million in 2017 and A0.3 million in 2018 and relates to subsidies we received in connection with the construction of our corrugated board production sites in Sch¨uttorf and Pl¨ossberg (both Germany) and the construction of our paper machine in Burg.

The increase in costs of materials was significantly below the 20.1% increase in total sales_ in 2018. The price of recycled paper declined between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2018 and remained at a comparatively low level for the rest of the year. As a result, our own average costs per ton for the recycled paper grades we purchased during 2018 were significantly lower (28.0%) compared to 2017. These considerable lower recycled paper prices and the unchanged production volume resulted in a decrease of recycled paper costs from A163.1 million in 2017 to A116.4 million in 2018. Costs of raw materials also include the costs of externally purchased containerboard as raw material for our corrugated board plants, which significantly rose from A160.5 million in 2017 to A246.4 million in 2018. This increase was attributable to significantly higher production and sales volumes of corrugated board, higher average purchase prices for external containerboard and a higher quantity of externally sourced containerboard. See also ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement _in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input Costs—Fluctuations in Raw Material Costs’’ above._ The cost of purchased services also increased significantly by A24.7 million or 35.9%, from A68.8 million in 2017 to A93.6 million in 2018, due to the reclassification of costs for waste water treatment from other operating expenses to cost of materials. These costs amounted to A5.8 million in 2017 and A14.2 million in 2018. The significant increase in costs of waste water treatment resulted from provisions for potential exceptional charges for waste water treatment in 2018. Energy costs (i.e. electricity, gas and steam) increased significantly from A50.5 million in 2017 to A60.3 million in 2018 due to higher prices for energy consumption and power network charges, in particular at our two existing paper machines (PM1 and PM2).

Total corrugated board sales increased by A74.7 million or 12.7% in 2017 compared to 2016, significantly in excess of general market growth. Corrugated board sales volumes increased by approximately 81,000 tons, from approximately 930,000 tons in 2016 to approximately 1,011,000 tons in 2017. This significant increase in sales volumes was attributable to (i) the successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany during 96 ----- 2016 and 2017 following commencement of commercial production in October 2015, (ii) the quick and successful (but ongoing) ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, (iii) our ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities as part of our Continuous Improvement Program as well as (iv) our continuing efforts to further optimize production of our Board plants. See also ‘‘—Key Factors _Affecting our Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ above. Our total_ containerboard sales volume decreased by approximately 24,000 tons or 2.3%, from approximately 1,042,000 tons in 2016 to approximately 1,018,000 tons in 2017, primarily due to capacity constraints imposed on the operation of our paper machine (PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt as a result of certain technical limitations of the local waste water treatment plant. The trend towards lighter containerboard impacted the production program of PM2 and led to a substitution of standard weight grades through super-lightweight containerboard. The lower output of super-light-weight containerboard in tons per hour is in general offset by higher sales prices. External sales of containerboard decreased by approximately 62,000 tons or 20.4% from approximately 304,000 tons in 2016 to approximately 242,000 tons in 2017 as we managed to further increase the share of internal containerboard sales to Board through further improved utilization of our existing corrugated board production sites, the successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany as well as the quick and successful (but ongoing) ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland. During the course of 2017, price levels for both corrugated board and containerboard increased significantly, which also had a positive impact on our total sales in 2017.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a decrease of operating profit from our operations, which could be the result of a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole; - the failure or delay of our customers to make payments due to us; - risks associated with our expansion and other investment projects, in particular our new paper machine project; - the failure to realize the expected benefits from our Continuous Improvement Program and from further future optimization initiatives; - the failure to further maintain a lean cost structure; - the failure to execute capacity expansion projects successfully; - any significant unplanned downtime of one or more of our production facilities and/or the CHP adjacent to our paper mill (PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt; - a failure to maintain low working capital requirements; - currency exchange rate fluctuations; - an increase in variable interest payments or taxes; and - the need to fund capacity expansion, unexpected replacement capital expenditures and other development capital expenditures.

This increase follows our strong performance and a lower increase in working capital compared to previous year’s first quarter. Contrary effects related to the absence of expenditure of exceptional size or incidence in the reporting period compared to the first quarter in 2018. Furthermore, higher income taxes paid impacted cash flows from operating activities. In 2018, our cash flow from operating activities increased by A74.5 million from A122.7 million in 2017 to A197.2 million in 2018. The increase in our cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to our improved EBITDA as a result of our strong operational performance. Contrary effects resulted from a A55.3 million increase in our trade working capital, from A114.2 million as at December 31, 2017 to A169.5 million as at December 31, 2018, as described in more detail below. In 2017, our cash flow from operating activities decreased by A29.9 million from A152.6 million in 2016 to A122.7 million in 2017, notwithstanding the significant increase in our net income for the period from A61.4 million in 2016 to A72.4 million in 2017. The decrease in our cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to the significant increase in our trade working capital, both as a result of a significant increase in inventories, trade receivables and other assets (not attributable to investing or financing activities) and a significant decrease in trade payables and other liabilities (not attributable to investing or financing activities), for the reasons discussed below. A significant increase in income taxes paid (from A10.6 million in 2016 to A17.9 million in 2017), due to higher net income in 2017 and a lower amount of tax loss carry-forwards available to off-set our net income, also contributed to the decrease in our cash flow from operating activities in 2017. Our cash flow from operating activities is significantly affected by changes in our net working capital. As a result, our cash flow from operating activities can be significantly affected by changes in raw material prices or an increase or decrease of sales volumes as well as payment terms, as those factors affect the amount of inventories, trade receivables and trade payables.

We record a liability under trade payables only if we have received the related supplier invoice by the relevant balance sheet date and provided that all other prerequisites for the recognition as a liability have been met. We record liabilities related to goods or services we have received during the relevant period, but for which we have not yet received an invoice, under other provisions on our balance sheet. These provisions for outstanding invoices amounted to A20.6 million, A22.1 million and A26.3 million as of December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and A33.1 million as of March 31, 2019, respectively. In the first three months of 2019, our trade working capital increased by A12.3 million, or 7.3%, from A169.5 million as of December 31, 2018 to A181.8 million as of March 31, 2019. Trade receivables increased by A19.5 million, or 17.9%, from A108.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to A128.2 million as of March 31, 2019, mainly due to year-end effects based on lower sales in December. At the same time, the amount of trade payables increased by A4.6 million, or 9.3%, from A49.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to A54.4 million as of March 31, 2019. This increase is primarily related to a higher external containerboard purchases to cover the raw material demand of our growing corrugated board business and our ongoing expansion projects. In 2018, our trade working capital increased by A55.3 million, or 48.4%, from A114.2 million as of December 31, 2017 to A169.5 million as of December 31, 2018, following the increase in our total output, as well as in the amount of income taxes paid. The increase in our trade working capital is attributable to 105 ----- (i) a significant increase in our trade receivables, (ii) a significant increase in our inventories and a slight decrease in our trade payables. Trade receivables increased by A29.9 million, or 37.9%, from A78.9 million as of December 31, 2017 to A108.8 million as of December 31, 2018 following our sales growth especially in countries with longer than average payment terms and as a result of a lower forfaiting volume in the fiscal year 2018 due to an already high cash position. The significant increase of A23.6 million, or 27.2%, in inventories from A86.9 million as of December 31, 2017 to A110.5 million is mainly driven by an increase in work in process by A22.5 million as a result of higher volume of stocks at our paper machines and higher volume of stocks of internal purchased containerboard at our corrugated board plants. Furthermore, a higher amount of spare parts led to an increase in raw materials, consumables and supplies. At the same time, the amount of trade payables decreased slightly by A1.7 million, or 3.5%, from A51.5 million as of December 31, 2017 to A49.8 million as of December 31, 2018 due to one-off effects as a result of reporting date factors. In 2017, our trade working capital increased significantly by A38.7 million or 51.3% from A75.5 million as of December 31, 2016 to A114.2 million as of December 31, 2017, notwithstanding the increase in our total output in 2017 of only 12.4%. Trade receivables increased by A19.3 million or 32.4% from A59.6 million as of December 31, 2016 to A78.9 million as of December 31, 2017 due to (i) significantly higher sales volumes towards year end 2017 compared to year end 2016, mainly as a result of our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany completing its ramp-up phase in 2017 and the fast ramp-up of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland during 2017, following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, as well as (ii) significantly higher prices for our corrugated board products at year end 2017 compared to year end 2016, and (iii) timing effects at year end 2016 and 2017. Inventories also increased significantly by A12.9 million or 17.5% from A73.9 million as of December 31, 2016 to A86.9 million as of December 31, 2017, mostly as a result of a A9.3 million or 50.4% increase in work in process from A18.4 million as of December 31. 2016 to A27.7 million as of December 31, 2017. This increase in work in process as of yearend 2017 relates to (i) our additional corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, which commenced production in April 2017 as well as (ii) a planned extended maintenance shutdown of our paper machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany. In anticipation of this planned shutdown, we already started to increase stock levels of the relevant containerboard grades produced by our paper machine (PM1) to be able to continue to meet the relevant containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production during the planned extended shutdown. Inventories of finished products also increased by A1.0 million or 25.3% from A4.0 million as of December 31, 2016 to A5.1 million as of December 31, 2017, both as a result of the higher volume of finished goods and the increase in the price for our finished goods at year end 2017. At the same time, the amount of trade payables decreased significantly by A6.5 million or 11.2% from A58.0 million as of December 31, 2016 to A51.5 million as of December 31, 2017, notwithstanding a significant increase in our raw material sourcing requirements in 2017 due to the increase in our corrugated board production and significantly higher prices for recycled paper and recycled containerboard in 2017 compared to 2016. The lower amount of trade payables at year end 2017 was primarily due to a high amount of trade payables as of December 31, 2016 related to the construction of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland. _Cash flow from investing activities_ Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of cash outflows for investments in tangible and intangible fixed assets as well as cash inflows from the disposal of fixed assets as well as interest received concerning financial assets and cash in hand. In the first three months of 2019, our cash outflow from investing activities increased by A52.2 million, or 278.9%, from A18.7 million in the first three months of 2018 to A70.9 million in the first three months of 2019. This increase was primarily due to the start of skeleton construction works for our new paper machine project (PM3) as well as investments into our corrugated board plants (PW12 and PW13) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and Eisfeld, Germany, each as described in more detail below. Smaller investments in different plants as part of our continuous maintenance capital expenditures also contributed to the overall increase. In 2018, our cash outflows from investing activities significantly increased by A111.2 million, or 233.0%, from A47.7 million in 2017 to A158.9 million in 2018. These cash outflows related to capital expenditures in connection with our new paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, our corrugated board project (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, the replacement of the sizer at our paper machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany, 106 ----- our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy and the extension of our existing corrugated board plant (PW6) in Offenbach, Germany, each as described in more detail below. Furthermore, we have made several smaller investments in our other existing production sites as part of our continuous maintenance capital expenditures. As a result, investments in tangible fixed assets significantly increased by A111.2 million from A47.8 million in 2017 to A159.0 million in 2018. In 2017, our cash outflows from investing activities increased by A24.5 million or 105.7%, from A23.2 million in 2016 to A47.7 million in 2017. This is due to the higher cash outflows due to payments to acquire tangible fixed assets related to the establishment of our corrugated board production sites (PW10, PW11 and PW12) in Trzcinica, Poland, Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom in 2017. Cash outflows from investing activities in 2016 primarily related to cash outflows due to payments to acquire tangible fixed assets in connection with the establishment of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland. We primarily finance our maintenance capital expenditures with cash flow from operating activities. From time to time, we have also financed our expansion capital expenditures through borrowings. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2019:",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

In the first three months of 2019, capital expenditures increased significantly by A52.2 million, or 278.8%, from A18.7 million in the first three months of 2018 to A70.9 million in the first three months of 2019, primarily due to (i) A53.1 million of capital expenditures in connection with the start of skeleton construction works for our new paper machine (PM3) and (ii) A3.1 million and A6.0 million of capital expenditures related to our corrugated board plant projects (PW12 and PW13) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and Eisfeld, Germany, respectively. Capital expenditures of A159.4 million in 2018 primarily relate to (i) A63.6 million of capital expenditures in connection with the start of construction works for our new paper machine project (PM3) in SandersdorfBrehna, Germany, (ii) A54.0 million of capital expenditures in connection with the establishment of our new corrugated board production ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (which commenced production in January 2019), (iii) A9.4 million of capital expenditures in connection with the start of construction works for our new corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, (iv) A7.3 million of capital expenditures in connection with the replacement of the sizer at our paper machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany and (v) A3.4 million of capital expenditures in connection with the extension of our existing corrugated board plant (PW6) in Offenbach, Germany. Capital expenditures of A47.9 million in 2017 primarily reflect (i) A16.0 million of capital expenditures in connection with the establishment of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland (which commenced production in April 2017), (ii) A8.5 million in 2017 of capital expenditures in connection with the establishment of our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy (which commenced production in early March 2018) and (iii) A11.6 million of capital expenditures in connection with the ongoing construction of our corrugated board production site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (following the start of construction in October 2017). 107 ----- Payments of capital expenditures of A23.4 million in 2016 primarily relate to our A22.1 million investment in connection with the establishment of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, on land we purchased from our large customer Janmar Centum adjacent to its existing packaging plant. _Free cash flow_ We define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less cash outflows from investing activities. Free cash flow comprises the cash surplus or deficit after expenditure on investments and taxes but before net cash used in/provided by financing activities, and before taking into account cash proceeds and payments relating to shareholders’ equity and financial liabilities. The reasons for changes in the free cash flow are therefore the same as explained above. In the first three months of 2019, our free cash flow decreased by A51.3 million from a cash inflow of A12.5 million in the first three months of 2018 to a cash outflow of A38.8 million in the first three months of 2019. In 2018, our free cash flow decreased by A36.7 million from a cash inflow of A75.0 million in 2017 to a cash inflow of A38.3 million in 2018. In 2017, our free cash flow decreased by A54.4 million from a cash inflow of A129.4 million in 2016 to a cash inflow of A75.0 million in 2017. _Cash flow from financing activities_ In the first three months of 2019, we reported a cash inflow from financing activities of A25.9 million, compared to a cash inflow of A423.3 million in the first three months of 2018. Cash flows from financing activities in the first three months of 2019 mainly related to A30 million of drawings under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities to finance the ongoing construction of our new paper machine (PM3) and interest paid as well as scheduled repayments under the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities. The high cash inflows of A423.3 million in the first three months of 2018 primarily relates to the issuance of the Existing Notes in March 2018, with the majority of the proceeds only used in May 2018 to redeem the Issuer’s A345,000,000 5.125% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2022. In 2018, we reported a cash outflow from financing activities of A6.3 million, mainly as a result of (i) the A352.9 million repayment of bonds and borrowings, which related to the redemption of the Issuer’s A345,000,000 5.125% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2022 on May 1, 2018 and scheduled repayments under the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities (A7.9 million), (ii) a A86.5 million special dividend payment to JH-Holding and our minority shareholders for the purpose of enabling JH-Holding to redeem all of its then-remaining A81.1 million outstanding principal amount of its PIK toggle notes on June 1, 2018, (iii) A50.1 million of interest paid, including interest payments under the Issuer’s senior secured notes as well as bank loans and lump sum fee payments (A19.3 million) to JH-Holding and our minority shareholders in return for granting security over their shares in the Issuer to secure our obligations under our various financing arrangements, as well as (iv) A8.7 million of cash outflows related to payments relating to expenditure of exceptional size or incidence due to extraordinary expenses (transaction costs, advisory and professional fees and others) we incurred in connection with the issuance of the Existing Notes in March 2018 and the negotiation and execution, in the third quarter of 2018, of Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility to finance a portion of our paper machine project (PM3) at Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. These cash outflows from financing activities more than offset cash inflows in 2018 relating to proceeds of bonds and borrowings of A490.6 million, including (i) A450 million from the offering of the Existing Notes in March 2018, (ii) A38.5 million of borrowings under the Facility A and the Facility B under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities and (iii) GBP3 million (carrying amount as of December 31, 2018: A3.5 million) of borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility. The amount repayable under Facility A under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities was subsequently reduced from A8.5 million to A7.2 million as of December 31, 2018 a result of a A1.3 million KfW repayment grant, which we reported as proceeds from grants received in 2018. In 2017, we reported a cash inflow from financing activities of A3.8 million, mainly as a result of (i) the excess proceeds from the A150 million aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes due 2024 issued in March 2017, after application of a portion of the proceeds to redeem A75 million aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s senior secured floating rate notes due 2022 and payment of costs, fees and expenses for the offering and (ii) PLN 92.0 million of drawings under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility in 2017 in connection with the completion of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland. These cash inflows from financing activities more than offset (i) A57.5 million in dividends distributed to our shareholders, including a A55.0 million special dividend in April 2017, which 108 ----- enabled JH-Holding, together with cash-in-hand, bank balances, to purchase A43.9 million aggregate principal amount of the PIK Toggle Notes in a tender offer and subsequently transfer such PIK Toggle Notes to JH-Holding Finance SA for cancellation, (ii) A8.9 million of payments in relation to a former finance lease agreement for the corrugator at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, including A1.5 million in regular payments during the course of 2017 and A7.4 million in payments upon termination of the financing lease agreement in December 2017, as well as (iii) PLN 36.4 million in scheduled repayments under the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities. In 2016, we reported a cash outflow from financing activities of A110.3 million as a result of the early optional redemption of A75.0 million in principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes, A26.5 million in interest payments and A6.2 million in dividends distributed to our shareholders.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

IFRS requires the presentation of assets and liabilities in order of liquidity only when a liquidity presentation provides information that is reliable and is more relevant than a current/ non-current presentation. Under German GAAP, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on the liquidity of the assets and liabilities. This results, for example, in the different presentation of financial assets and liabilities and deferred taxes in the statement of financial position under IFRS and German GAAP. Unlike IFRS, German GAAP does not require the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income and it is very common (but not required) that the income statement under the German GAAP will be prepared using the ‘‘nature of expense’’ method and not the ‘‘cost of sales’’ method, which is generally used in the IFRS financial statements.

201,Offerings 2019.md,1170,SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GERMAN GAAP AND IFRS,1170.2,Consolidation Principles,1170.2.1,,"Under IFRS, capital consolidation has to follow the acquisition method, with identifiable assets and liabilities being measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Under German GAAP, capital consolidation was required to be reported using the carrying amount method until 2009. From 2010, the acquisition method and valuation by acquisition date fair values was introduced into German GAAP. Under IFRS, an entity (investor) is required to consolidate another entity (investee), depending on whether it controls the investee. An investor controls an investee when it has power over an investee, is exposed, or has rights to the variable returns from its involvement and due to his power can influence the amount of these variable returns. The consolidation conclusions under IFRS will not differ significantly from the German GAAP regulations for the most straightforward entities. However, some differences may arise where there are complex group structures or where specific entities have been established. Investors that are most likely affected have their involvements, for example, in the following entities: - Entities with a dominant investor without a majority of the voting or similar rights and where the rest of voting rights belongs to the widely-dispersed shareholders (de-facto control); - Structured entities (formerly ‘‘special purpose entities’’) where voting or similar rights are not the dominant means to determine the power. Under German GAAP, an investor is required to consolidate the investee if an investor holds the majority of voting rights, enjoys the right to appoint or dismiss the majority of the management and supervisory board members, enjoys the right to exercise a controlling influence on financial and operating policies or in substance obtains the majority of risks and rewards of an investee that has a narrow, well-defined purpose (‘‘special purpose entity’’).",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,1170,SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GERMAN GAAP AND IFRS,1170.3,Business Combination,1170.3.1,,"Under IFRS 3 acquisition related cost (transaction cost) that incurs to effect a business combination are accounted as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received. Acquisition-related costs are not part of the consideration transferred to the seller in return for the business; they are not part of the fair value of the acquired business; they do not represent an asset of the acquirer. Acquisition-related costs represent services that have been rendered to and consumed by the acquirer. As such, IFRS 3 states that they are accounted for as an expense when the acquirer consumes the related service. Under German GAAP certain cost which have been incurred after the decision to acquire an entity qualify for capitalization and form part of the acquisition cost (e.g. due diligence cost, consultancy cost for valuation reports). All expenses incurred prior to the decision making have to be expensed as incurred. Costs related to the issuance of financial liabilities are expensed as incurred. Optionally, interest-like expenses are capitalized and amortized over the term of the debt. For purchase price allocation all identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries are reflected at their fair value regardless of the level of minority share. Under IFRS 3, goodwill acquired in a business combination, must be allocated to a cash generating unit (CGU) or group(s) of CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Under German GAAP goodwill is allocated to the respective business unit to which it refers. Under IFRS goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and if there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGU is compared with its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is less than its carrying amount, an entity should reduce the carrying amount to the recoverable amount. The reduction is an impairment loss. For assets carried on the depreciated historical cost basis the impairment loss should be recognized in profit or loss immediately. For assets that are carried at revalued amounts an impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. The loss is first set against any revaluation surplus relating to the asset in other comprehensive income to the extent of the surplus and the remaining balance of the loss (if any) is then treated as an expense in profit or loss. 115 ----- German GAAP requires goodwill to be amortized over its economic life.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset are capitalized as part of the cost of that asset. Overhead costs, such as general and administrative costs and expenses for social services, voluntary social benefits and company pensions are not part of the production cost. Under IFRS, individual items within property, plant and equipment are frequently composed of different component parts with varying useful lives or consumption patterns. These parts are individually replaced during the useful life of an asset. Under IFRS, each such part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is recognized and depreciated separately (component approach). Costs of required and regular major inspections are capitalized and depreciated if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the reporting entity and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. After initial recognition IFRS further offers an option to value items of property, plant and equipment at either the (lower) cost of the item less any accumulated depreciation and impairment or at its fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment. Under German GAAP, property, plant and equipment is initially valued at purchase or production cost and includes general and administrative costs and expenses for social services, voluntary social benefits and company pensions. Capitalization of costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset is permitted, but not required (alternative treatment). The component approach is not specifically contemplated by German GAAP rules, but its use for balance sheet purposes is generally permitted. Costs of regular major inspections are recognized in the income statement as incurred. A revaluation model is not permitted. Costs of demolishing or restoring an item of property, plant and equipment do not qualify for capitalization but are required to be reported as provision over the item’s useful life.

Under IFRS, provisions are recognized if an enterprise has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable (i.e., more likely than not to occur) that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. In cases where the outflow of economic resources is expected to occur, an obligation will be reported as a liability. The discount rate used to determine the amount of any provisions is determined by reference to a pre-tax interest rate for a risk-free obligation that matches the maturity of the liability to which the provision relates. Under German GAAP, the criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingencies are less detailed and prescriptive than under IFRS. Accordingly, there is greater flexibility under German GAAP to record provisions for onerous contracts and restructuring expenses. In addition, German GAAP estimates are typically made in a more conservative manner. The recognition of a provision with a probability lower than 50% is possible. German GAAP requires the recording of provisions for deferred maintenance that is expected to be performed within three month after the end of the reporting period, uncertain liabilities and expected losses from executory contracts. Long-term provisions (i.e., with a maturity of more than one year) are discounted using an average market interest rate for the preceding seven years as published by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). Under IFRS, acquisition costs for property, plant and equipment include the initial estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.

A finance lease was a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and benefits incident to ownership of the leased item. For finance leases, the lessee recorded an asset and an obligation at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value of leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Operating leases were expensed as incurred. With implementation of IFRS 16, starting for periods after January 1, 2019, lessee has a right of use asset and contrary a liability. The right-of-use asset is a lessee’s right to use an asset over the life of a lease. The asset is calculated as the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made to the lessor before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, minus any lease incentives received. The amortization period for the right-of-use asset is from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the lease term or the end of the useful life of the asset. An exception is when it is reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise an option to purchase the asset, in which case the amortization period is through the end of the asset’s useful life. If a right-of-use asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment is immediately recorded, thereby reducing the carrying amount of the asset. Its subsequent measurement is calculated as the carrying amount immediately after the impairment transaction, minus any subsequent accumulated amortization. At the termination of a lease, the right-of-use asset and associated lease liability are removed from the books of the lessee. The difference between the two amounts is accounted for as a profit or loss at that time. Under German GAAP, accounting for leases is mainly driven by tax regulations, so the lease contracts in Germany typically consider such rules in order to avoid capitalization at the lessee level. These rules differ from the IFRS rules in several respects.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

201,Offerings 2019.md,1171,INTRODUCTION,1171.1,,1171.1.1,,"Containerboard is one of the principal materials used to manufacture corrugated board and, ultimately, corrugated containers. Containerboard is classified according to the type of raw materials from which it is made (virgin fibres or recycled fibres), whether it is surface treated and whether it is enhanced by coating. Two types of containerboard can be produced. Containerboard made from virgin fibres (wood pulp) is known as ‘‘kraftliner’’ and is—depending on the type of application—better suited for manufacturing corrugated board and containers intended for the retail and consumer packaging markets, owing to its greater strength, especially its high bursting strength, moisture resistance and purity. Containerboard made from recycled fibres (recycled paper, the primary source of which is old corrugated containers and mixed recycled paper), is known as ‘‘testliner’’ and fluting and is better suited for transportation and industrial packaging, due to its higher stiffness, lower weight and cheaper price. Containerboard is classified as kraftliner as long as it contains mainly virgin fibres. Several distinct types of containerboard products are available in the market, resulting from different formulations of virgin and recycled fibres. This broad offering of containerboard products serves to address a wide range of potential packaging applications. Both kraftliner and testliner can be surface treated to improve printing quality through the use of white, mottled or fully bleached pulp as the top layer (white-top liner). The board can also be coated, which makes it more resistant to dirt and moisture, and allows high-gloss printing. This further enhances product appearance and suitability for retail and consumer packaging. Virtually all containerboard becomes corrugated board, in the form of linerboard and fluting. Linerboard is used for the inner and outer layers of the corrugated board and fluting for the middle section. Corrugated board producers select containerboard grades, specifications and suppliers based on availability, suitability for their own corrugators and converting machines as well as on brand owners’ performance requirements. The retail industry, through its own specific requirements, has also been one of the key drivers for containerboard and corrugated board technology and product development. For corrugated box and sheet producers, containerboard is one uniform market as corrugated board can consist of a mixture of any type of linerboard or fluting depending on end use and quality requirements. Corrugated board can come in a range of types, including single face, single wall, double wall, or triple wall, depending on the ultimate packaging application. Corrugated board is eventually converted by corrugated box producers into regular slotted containers (RSC), die-cut boxes or other containers, and sold to brand owners or packers before reaching retailers and end-consumers. The main end-use segment in Europe is food and beverages, although the breakdown varies by country. Kraftliner is used especially in the food segment, where strength and purity are important requirements, whereas testliner is generally used in non-food fast-moving consumer goods and consumer durables. The industry is typically viewed as comprising two main production activities: (i) the production of containerboard and corrugated board; and (ii) the conversion of corrugated board into corrugated 120 ----- containers or other fibre-based packaging products. There are several operating models within the containerboard and corrugated board industry. The majority of containerboard suppliers are forward integrated such that they also operate in corrugated board and box conversion. This can allow a greater degree of control over raw material flows and pricing. Others keep a more restricted focus on particular high-value sections of the production process, and distribute products to independent sheet plants. We focus on the highly efficient production and processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of corrugated board sheets for our mostly family-owned customers in the packaging industry. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated paper and packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that bring addedvalue to our customers in the packaging industry, _i.e., the efficient and integrated production of containerboard and corrugated board. Progroup, although we have the ability to produce kraftliner, focuses on testliner production for the European market. In Western Europe, recycled paper is the main raw material for the production of recycled containerboard and other fibre packaging boards. Recycled containerboard constitutes approximately 83% of containerboard production, with kraftliner constituting the remainder. In Europe, containerboard manufacturers tend to source the majority of their raw materials from external suppliers.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

In Western Europe, demand has grown faster than industrial production since 2012 and reached its peak in late 2017/early 2018, with a deceleration in the later part of the year and an expected decrease in growth rates between 2019 and 2020. In Eastern Europe, growth rates have been consistently, and significantly above GDP growth since 2000 and the demand growth is expected to continue in the medium term, despite uncertainties in the shorter term, with demand decelerating in 2018 mainly due to Turkey and slower growth in Central Europe. Demographic and lifestyle changes, including rising urbanization and demand for convenience, such as take-aways and home deliveries, have driven growth in demand for corrugated packaging, and will continue to do so especially in Emerging Europe (defined as Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe by RISI). The effect of improvements in living standards and consumer spending in Emerging Europe and other emerging markets will support growth going forward. Development of the retail infrastructure in these markets, including online shopping and mail order, and the development of the logistics market, is expected to increase demand for containerboard products such as die-cut containers, shelf-ready packaging and decorative corrugated pieces. In addition, the booming agro-based sector, for example, will create new demand for containerboards by replacing the traditional wooden boxes with corrugated containers. Containerboard demand will also be increasingly exposed to the general tendency to reduce packaging costs, with, for example, light weighting and reduced packaging. Plastics and returnable/reusable transit packs (RTP) will increasingly compete with corrugated board packaging, especially in mature markets and especially for the fresh fruit and vegetable markets. The future competitiveness of fibre-based packaging will depend on innovation, product development, cost and the industry’s ability in general to respond to changing market requirements. The competitive position of containerboard and corrugated board is expected to remain relatively strong in comparison with alternative materials. Recyclability, for example, will have a favorable impact on containerboard demand growth. The high recovery and recycling rate of wood fibre-based packaging compared to plastics will benefit the industry. The poor environmental image of plastics coupled with its higher cost are also expected to have a positive impact on the demand prospects for fibre-based packaging in mature markets. Some of the newer products, such as microflutes, will support the use of containerboards and corrugated boards in the competition against folding cartons. Retail- and shelf-ready packaging has opened new opportunities for corrugated board and has brought it closer to the consumers. Logistic and shelf space planning are key competitive advantages against other packaging substrates. Recycled containerboard capacity has steadily gained share of the Western European containerboard market over the last 15 years. The share of these grades rose from approximately 77% during the last years of the 1990s to approximately 83% in 2018. The growing importance of recycled containerboard has been driven by a variety of reasons, including i) lower prices of both PfR and recycled containerboard versus virgin grades (partly due to subsidies for energy uses); ii) improving quality of testliner products and kraftliner substitutes; iii) efforts by consumer goods companies to burnish their sustainability and consumer demand for recycled products leading to a surge in kraftliner substitutes; iv) market undersupply of unbleached kraft pulp. Like Western Europe, the containerboard market in Emerging Europe is dominated by recycled grades. Usage of recycled containerboard has increased substantially as a share of the total over the last 15 years within Emerging Europe. Recycled products represented 60% of regional containerboard consumption in the last years of the 1990s, but the share reached almost 80% in 2018. Expanding availability of high-quality recycled grades, partially from Western European suppliers, and a greater focus on sustainability were major drivers of the rising share of recycled products. Containerboard is generally a regional business, and the majority of the volumes is traded within Europe. However, some regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa, are net importers of containerboard. Hence, the demand from exports of the containerboard market is partially influenced by the evolution of the EUR/USD exchange rate.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

201,Offerings 2019.md,1173,END-MARKETS DYNAMICS,1173.1,Key supply parameters,1173.1.1,,"Containerboard is manufactured either by treating virgin fibres or by cleaning and screening recycled fibres before passing these through paper machines, which are comprised of a paper-forming section, a press section (where water is squeezed out), a drying section and the finishing. The containerboard is then wound into rolls and shipped to corrugated board plants. Containerboard mills are large, capital expenditure intensive production facilities and the production landscape is continuously changing as a result of new capacity additions and closures. As there is a significant lead time between the planning and completion of new containerboard machines, the supply side tends to lag behind changes in demand. Furthermore, the containerboard production process is reasonably specialized, such that there is very limited flexibility to switch from containerboard production to the production of other paperboard grades, or from kraftliner to testliner (or vice versa), in response to market conditions. Corrugated sheets are interim products manufactured from containerboard at a sheet feeder plant or an integrated corrugated and converting plant. Corrugated sheets are then converted into corrugated containers at integrated converting plants or at sheet plants. The corrugated sheet is first printed, if required, and then formed into the final container (or box) shape usually by some combination of die-cutting, folding, gluing, stapling or stitching the sheet. Corrugated containers are designed specifically to meet individual customer requirements and there is a wide variety of designs available. Corrugated sheets are bulky products, which tend to be produced and supplied locally due to high transportation costs, requirements of customers for supply chain integration and just-in-time delivery. The economic supply distance for corrugated sheets is typically around 300 kilometers. Therefore, there are many corrugated board plants and the market in Europe is more fragmented than the containerboard market. 123 ----- Since the early 2000s, there has been a significant development in the European containerboard industry and its asset base: more than 15 new machines have started up, all of which are capable of producing the full range of recycled fibre grades. This is part of a constant push towards increasing efficiency and lowering manufacturing costs in order to ensure competitiveness. These manufacturing costs are exposed to raw material prices and availability (recycled paper vs. virgin pulp). The response from the suppliers has been to use cheaper raw materials both in containerboard and corrugated packaging production. There have been shut-downs in Europe, but these have typically been of old and narrow machines with weak cost competitiveness and suboptimal trim fit and/or product portfolio. Shut-downs have typically been part of companies’ asset strategy, and their volumes have typically been compensated by capacity increases in other production units. The production landscape is described in greater detail below. The European containerboard and corrugated board industry has experienced several trends affecting product and product construction as well as production process. Some of the trends originate from the end-users (retail, consumers and brand-owners), but the industry itself has also managed to introduce new concepts. All these trends have raised the status of corrugated board from pure transportation packaging closer to retail and even consumer packaging. The key trends can be listed as follows: - Light weighting, which has extended to both containerboard and corrugated board. This is a response to transportation cost pressure, as well as industry evolution and a trend towards eco-efficiency; - Small flutes and multiwall constructions are partly related to the light weighting as the introduction of lower basis weight fluting has enabled the microflute concept and use of corrugated in consumer packages as well as increasing need in heavy duty applications; - Die-cuts and point-of-sales (POS), which is to satisfy the demand for retail ready packaging; - White-top liners and high-quality printing are for direct use consumer packages and shelf ready packaging; printing requirements are increasing in industrial packaging; and - Wider corrugators have been introduced to improve the efficiency at corrugated plants and better fit with new containerboard machines.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,1173,END-MARKETS DYNAMICS,1173.2,Pricing dynamics,1173.2.1,,"Containerboard prices are primarily a function of the prevailing supply-demand balance (in this respect, additional growth has resulted from the strong increase in e-commerce volumes), raw material prices and other operating costs, such as energy, chemicals and transportation. Demand for containerboard has tended to develop in line with industrial growth rates due to the characteristics of the main end-user markets for corrugated containers. In contrast, the supply side of the containerboard market is fairly inelastic owing to capital intensity, long lead times between planning and completion of a mill and the low versatility of the paper machines. This can result in temporary supply/ demand imbalances driving prices up and down, such as those which have been experienced in recent years. Another driver of containerboard prices is the cost of the principal raw materials: recycled paper or virgin fibre. While wood prices historically have been relatively stable, recycled paper prices can vary widely on a regional basis depending on demand and tend to be volatile even within short time periods. Fluctuations in Asian demand (particularly Chinese demand) and seasonal patterns of collection and demand have been the principal factors driving the recycled paper price in recent years. Given the significant implications of price fluctuations of recycled paper on business performance, we (as well as several other industry participants) have therefore sought better access to recycled paper through a broad supplier portfolio including access to box plant clippings and direct supply contracts with municipalities or retailers from time to time. The cost of producing containerboard is also influenced by the prices of energy, starch, chemicals and transportation. Energy prices, in particular electricity, oil and natural gas, have experienced significant volatility in recent years, with a corresponding effect on paper production costs. Containerboard is the main cost factor of corrugated sheets and of corrugated packaging overall. Therefore, corrugated sheets price usually follows containerboard price development with some delay, typically by about two to three months. 124 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

In the past year there has been moderate growth. New capacity has continued to come on stream, mainly in lightweight recycled and white-top grades, but older, inefficient capacity has been shut. Regional capacity hit 24.4 million tons in 2007 and was still 24.6 million tons in 2013, according to RISI; since then it has grown to 27.1 million tons (2017). RISI expects capacity growth of 3.5%, 2.1% and 3.1% in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Operating rates peaked in 2006 at 95% in Western Europe before dropping sharply to a bottom of 87% in 2009. Strong capacity management on the part of producers kept operating rates from sliding further, with RISI’s numbers showing a 2% reduction in industry capacity in 2009. The continuing focus on capacity management has been instrumental in enabling operating rates to rebound back to the long-term average of 93% in 2010-2017. RISI shows that capacity utilization raised to above 96% in 2017 and reduced slightly to 95% in 2018. Capacity expansion is expected to continue growing over the next several years, although at a lower rate than previously expected due to a lessening in demand and weaker macro conditions. The majority of the projects announced during the year are converted graphic paper machines, along with incremental upgrades of existing containerboard capacity although less than initially announced. Additional new capacity has been announced, e.g. Progroup’s PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna (Germany) and Papierfabrik Palm’s machine in Aalen (Germany), both adding further 750kt capacity each by 2020 and 2022 respectively. RISI expects containerboard operating rates to decline to 93% in Western Europe in 2019 (from 96% in 2017) with anticipated oversupply in Central Europe and Italy creating downward pressure on containerboard and PfR prices. Operating rates are expected to stabilize to approximately 92% in the long-term, similar to the historical long-term average. _Eastern Europe_ Containerboard capacity has expanded steadily in Emerging Europe since 2000, averaging growth of 424,000 tons per year.

Operating rates in Emerging Europe improved consistently from 2000 to 2007, rising from 82% to 89%. The abrupt flattening in domestic demand in 2008-2009, along with a loss of share to imports from Western Europe and continuing investment in new capacity, resulted in regional capacity utilization decreasing to 79% in 2009. However, operating rates rebounded over the next four years, returning to 84% in 2013, and increasing to 90% in 2018. This rate is expected to be at around 89% in the next five years. Capacity is expected to continue expanding over the next several years in Emerging Europe, although growth in certain sub-regions like Central Europe is expected to be limited due to raw material availability, even if more than 3 million tonnes in capacity growth are expected in the long-term.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

Real prices (in 2016 euros) averaged A382/ton in the latter part of the 1990s and have been around A479/ton over 2013 - 2017 and peaked to A552/ton in 2018. The range in real prices during the last 20 years has been from a peak of A552/ton in 2018 to a low of A321/ton in 2009. Both the trend and the range in real prices have been closely related to movements in recycled paper costs, which have been erratic on an annual basis and rising in real terms on a secular basis. Strong demand for recycled containerboard and relatively low recycled paper costs allowed producers to generate significant profit margins through much of the 1990s. RISI’s analysis shows the Western European testliner industry registering a price to total cost ratio of around 0.96 in 1995-2000. Rapidly increasing recycled paper costs and slowing demand growth resulted in profitability declining during the last decade, reaching a low of 0.91 in the recession year of 2009. Containerboard prices remained stable until the second quarter of 2008, when prices started to decline as the rapid weakening of the global economy decreased the demand for corrugated boxes (and containerboard). This was reflected in decreased demand and prices for testliner. Containerboard demand started to increase in the end of 2009 and the upturn of the economy was seen in Europe by mid-year 2010. Growth resumed in the international trade from early 2010 and the external demand and prices for containerboard increased as well. The industry price to total cost ratio reached a peak of approximately 1.36 in 2018 and is expected to be closer to 1.1 for 2022 and 2023. European testliner prices declined by approximately 20% from August 2011 to February 2012 due to the soft supply/demand balance and due to decreased recycled paper prices. Improved demand as well as the increase of recycled paper prices turned testliner prices back to growth track in mid-February 2012; however, with the continuing economic slowdown, the price level was not sustainable and prices declined as a result. In 2016, prices have further decreased by 4.0% in the last year in real terms, before surging by 6.8% in real terms in 2017 and by 8.1% in 2018.

Price difference between recycled paper and testliner has been on average just above A300. During the recessional years 2008-2010, prices dropped due to weak demand and the prices for testliner also dropped due to decline in raw material prices. After a steady increase in prices between 2013 and 2015, testliner prices have been coming down since the start of 2016 despite of healthy demand and no large capacity additions during 2016. Whilst European recycled containerboard producers raised prices by approximately A100-110/ton in 2017, they achieved only part of the announced A50-60/ton in early 2018, due to lower production costs and new ramped-up capacity.

Since we commenced operations in 1992, we have carefully selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a greenfield strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we operate. As a result, we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high technological standards, resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and relatively low requirements for additional capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the high technological standards of our production facilities, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for light-weight packaging, (ii) the increasing importance of small-size packaging due to the growing importance of e-commerce, and (iii) the general trend towards a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and energy, which can help reduce costs, CO2 emissions and fresh water consumption. Our core business comprises Paper and Board. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible containerboard production using almost exclusively recycled paper, with high output volumes to increase cost efficiency and short delivery times. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and the first three months of 2019, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for most of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and the ability of Board to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. In addition, our customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options. 132 ----- Paper manufactures containerboard at our two paper mills in Germany, with an envisaged total annual production capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons of containerboard. Our two existing paper machines, PM1 in Burg and PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, have complementary production layouts which allow us to produce brown containerboard with grammages between 60-230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recycled paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the appropriate widths for Board’s ten existing corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a total annual production capacity of approximately 1,440,000 tons of corrugated board, including our latest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) at Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom. Our historic greenfield location strategy ensures close customer proximity and high production flexibility. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we further acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH, the combined heat and power plant (the ‘‘CHP’’) adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and certain related assets (the ‘‘CHP Acquisition’’). As a result thereof, we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves (‘‘Power’’). In 2018, we sold approximately 1,151,000 tons of corrugated board and approximately 176,000 tons of containerboard to external customers across Europe, resulting in external corrugated board and containerboard sales, respectively, of A840.0 million (86.9% of total sales) and A84.5 million (8.7% of total sales). Paper’s total sales in 2018 include A17.9 million (1.9% of total sales) in revenues from the sale of electricity and revenues from the incineration of refuse-derived fuel resulting from the integration of the CHP as well as A9.7 million (1.0% of total sales) in sales from passing purchased fuel costs to Sales and Solutions GmbH. Total external sales by Board and Paper in 2018 (including sales other than corrugated board or containerboard sales, respectively) amounted to A840.8 million (87.0% of total sales) and A112.9 million (11.7% of total sales). Our total sales and EBITDA in 2018 amounted to A966.1 million and A275.5 million, respectively.

According to Vision Hunters, we are the third largest producer of corrugated board in Europe (by production capacity) through our corrugated board business (‘‘Board’’) and the sixth largest producer of recycled containerboard in Europe (by production capacity) through our containerboard business (‘‘Paper’’). We focus on the highly efficient production and processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of corrugated board sheets for our mostly family-owned box manufacturing customers. In this core market segment, we are the market leader by volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, according to Vision Hunters. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated paper and packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that bring added-value to our customers in the packaging industry, _i.e. the automated and integrated production of containerboard and corrugated board. Our customers serve various end markets, including industrial/manufacturing, consumer durables, processed foods, non-food manufactured consumer goods and fresh food. Unlike many fully integrated market players, we do not produce boxes and therefore do not compete with our box manufacturing customers but instead focus solely on the production of containerboard and corrugated board.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,1177,HISTORY,1177.1,,1177.1.1,,"Our Group was founded in 1991, when J¨urgen Heindl, our controlling shareholder and chief executive officer, established PROWELL Papierverarbeitung GmbH and launched our first plant (PW1) for the production of corrugated board in Offenbach a. d. Queich, Germany, in the following year. From the beginning, we intended to focus on the highly-efficient production of small batch sizes of sheet board for small and medium-sized customers based on high technological standards. In 1996, a second corrugated board production site (PW2) was established in Douvrin, France, and, in 1998, a third corrugated board production site (PW3) was launched in Burg, Germany. Another key milestone in the development of our Group was the establishment of our first paper mill in Burg with our paper machine PM1 for the production of medium- to heavy-weight containerboard with grammages of 100-230g/m[2]. At the time, PM1 introduced a number of new technological features, including a ‘‘2 gap former’’, a ‘‘drum pulper’’, a ‘‘speed sizer’’ and a closed water loop that minimizes the creation of waste water. PM1 represented a significant intermediate step towards the high-speed production of lighter containerboard. In 2002 and 2005, respectively, we further expanded our corrugated board capacity by launching our fourth and fifth corrugated board production sites in Rokycany, Czech Republic (PW4) and in Sch¨uttorf, Germany (PW5). The corrugators at those two production sites have a width of 3.3 meters, which represented a new technology standard for the industry at the time and resulted in significant productivity gains. In 2007, we established Europe’s largest corrugated board production site in Offenbach a. d. Queich, Germany (PW6), replacing the original PW1 facility at the same site. In 2009, we realized another two greenfield projects with the construction of our corrugated board production sites in Strykow, Poland (PW7) and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW8). Also in 2009, we commenced construction of our second paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany, with our paper machine PM2 commencing production of super-light-weight to medium-weight containerboard in March 2010. To secure a portion of the necessary funding for our A420 million investment in our paper machine PM2, we raised additional equity in 2008 and 2009. In particular, J¨urgen Heindl established JH-Holding, our controlling shareholder, in 2007. JH-Holding entered into the Former JH-Holding Facility and used a portion of the proceeds from its borrowings under the Former JH-Holding Facility to subscribe for additional shares in the Issuer. In addition, the Issuer issued preference shares to BWK GmbH Unternehmensbeteiligungsgesellschaft. To secure a reliable supply of energy to our paper machine PM2, we entered into certain framework and ancillary agreements with Progroup Power 1 GmbH and its parent company Sales & Solutions GmbH (formerly EnBW Energy Solutions GmbH) in 2008 for the construction and operation of the CHP adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt. The CHP commenced operation in 2011. 142 ----- In July 2014, we announced a strategic investment in the construction of our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany adjacent to and connected with a packaging plant of our customer Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk. This site commenced production in October 2015. At our corrugated board productions sites in Burg, Offenbach, Sch¨uttorf and Ellesmere Port, some of our customers have established their own production sites in close proximity to, or even on, our production sites. With our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, we followed our customer for the first time and set up our facility at the existing site of a customer. In April 2015, we refinanced all then outstanding amounts under our Former Senior Credit Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of A250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our Existing Fixed Rate Notes and A150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s senior secured floating rate notes due 2022, and we also entered into the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. At the same time, JH-Holding Finance SA, a newly incorporated finance subsidiary of JH-Holding, the Issuer’s direct controlling shareholder, also issued the PIK Toggle Notes, primarily to fund the acquisition of all rights under the Former JH-Holding Facility and to fund the acquisition of all preference shares in the Issuer then held by BWK GmbH Unternehmensbeteiligungsgesellschaft. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH, the CHP and certain related assets outright from EnBW. As a result thereof, we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves. The completion of the CHP Acquisition constituted a significant milestone in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and allowed us to significantly reduce our energy costs. As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced production in the first quarter of 2017 at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we purchased from our large customer Janmar Centrum adjacent to its existing packaging plant. Following the success of the two packaging park projects (PW9 and PW10) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany and in Trzcinica, Poland, we also established our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of our new customer, Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l. The commencement of production at this new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 100,000 tons, also marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. In addition, with a total investment of approximately A85-A90 million into the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom to replace our now decommissioned corrugated board production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers from the new site, after its commencement of production in January 2019, we have now also become a significant player in the UK market. This newest corrugated board production site operates with a 3.35m trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), which we established in 2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width. We believe that the new production site, with its large capacity and state-of-the-art equipment, is one of the largest and most efficient corrugated sheet board plants globally and position us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we have historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins. As we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter in 2019 or the first quarter of 2020), we further expect to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites between 2020 and 2023 including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early 2021). In 2018, we achieved a milestone in our corporate history by implementing our new branding in order to further strengthen our core brand ‘‘Progroup’’, provide clearer focus and realize the full potential of the ‘‘Progroup’’ brand in the market. The previous individual brands ‘‘Prowell’’, ‘‘Propapier’’ and ‘‘Prologistik’’ were unified under a single umbrella at the end of November 2018. Since then, we have operated under a single uniform and strong Progroup brand: - Progroup refers to the centralized management and administration of the Group by Progroup AG, the Issuer, from our headquarters in Landau, Germany. - Progroup Paper (formerly Propapier) encompasses our containerboard production activities at our two mills in Burg (PM1) and Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2) (both located in Germany) and also includes the related energy production of Power at the CHP adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt. 143 ----- - Progroup Board (formerly Prowell) encompasses our corrugated board production at our ten production sites in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. - Progroup Logistics (formerly Prologistik) encompasses our own logistics operations, including a fleet of trucks we operate primarily to service the business operations of Paper and Board. To support this rebranding, we also changed the legal entity names of the various entities within our group in the fourth quarter of 2018, except for Progroup AG and Prowell Verwaltungs GmbH.

With a trim width of 5.8 meters, it produces medium- to heavy-weight containerboard with grammages of 100-230g/m[2] using recycled fibre and, to a small extent, virgin fibre. We believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001, PM1 was the world’s technologically most advanced containerboard paper machine setting new technology standards, including with the use of a closed water cycle, thereby minimizing the creation of waste water. Through a series of investments and optimization measures since its launch, we have been able to significantly improve the annual capacity of PM1 from approximately 287,000 tons of containerboard in 2001 to approximately 420,000 tons in 2018. In addition, since the launch of our paper machine PM2, we further developed PM1 towards the production of heavier paper grades (i.e., grammages of 100-230g/m[2]), including testliner, kraftliner, proliner K, fluting paper and promedium S. 144 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

We believe that PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machine based on trim width and designed speed. This allows us to set new industry standards with respect to raw material efficiency, cost leadership as well as containerboard and corrugated board design. With its ability to produce super-light-weight paper grades, PM2 helps us to reduce consumption of recycled paper. For more information about our range of ‘‘next generation’’ products, including next fibre� and next board�, see ‘‘—Sustainability Focus; Research and Development’’ below. With a trim width of 10.2 meters, PM2 has an annual containerboard capacity of approximately 680,000 tons, and since its launch in 2010, PM2 has set five new world records for production speed of various lightweight paper grades.

Earthworks for the new paper machine already started in January 2019 and, subject (among other things) to obtaining the missing regulatory approvals and construction proceeding according to plan, we currently expect this further state-of-the-art paper machine to start production in the second half of 2020, with a total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 750,000 tons. Once PM3 has commenced operations, we also plan for further specialization of our then three paper machines which we expect will further enhance the productivity of all our paper machines as each paper mill will be able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. Following completion of the ramp-up phase of this potential further paper mill, this would mean an increase of the total annual containerboard capacity of Paper from currently approximately 1,100,000 tons to approximately 1,850,000 tons. The proposed new paper machine (PM3) will have a 9.2m trim width, which would allow us to optimize containerboard production to meet the requirements of the more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our newer corrugated board production sites, which would result in low volumes of cutting scrap and higher productivity.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

Our two paper machines, PM1 in Burg and PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, are complementary to each other due to different production layouts and allow us to produce brown containerboard with grammages between 60-230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recycled paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the appropriate widths for our corrugated board production sites. To cover the increasing demand for consistently high-quality containerboard, Progroup has begun the realisation of a further paper machine project in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. The new, state-of-the-art paper machine PM3 will start production in the second half of 2020 and provide a further production capacity of around 750,000 tons of containerboard. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible containerboard production, with high output volumes to increase cost efficiency and short delivery times. During 2018, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for approximately 80-85%, by volume, of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board. As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production capacity in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have increased to approximately 82% (or 93%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of the total sales, by volume, of Paper in 2018, which means that we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. At the same time, we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or improve our overall Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared to corrugated board margins) of certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options. The steady increase in the degree of vertical integration between Paper and Board over the last few years has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply chain. In 2018, our Paper operations generated A112.9 million in external sales, which represented 11.7% of our total sales. The majority of these external containerboard sales were generated under one-year contracts with packaging customers. The remainder of our external containerboard sales in 2018 was generated through spot market and multi-year supply agreements. Our external containerboard customers include both other producers of corrugated board as well as commodity traders.

Since the establishment of our Group, we have planned and developed our production sites primarily as greenfield projects and, more recently, as packaging park projects to ensure the optimal geographic location as well as a high technological standard for each site. Our Board operations focus on the efficient and flexible production of customized small batch series, with a high degree of automation at all our production sites, both with respect to the production process itself as well as order handling. We believe we offer significant added value to our customers by offering fully automated online ordering, reliable and just-in-time delivery within 24 hours for selected products and online order tracking. For more information, see ‘‘—Information Technology and Process Management’’. Our range of Board corrugated board products includes all customary single-wall, double-wall and triple-wall flutes, and we have devoted significant time and efforts to developing a range of ‘‘next generation’’ products which feature reduced raw material consumption while maintaining or even improving technical specifications. For more information about these products, including next board� and next box�, see ‘‘—Sustainability Focus; Research and Development’’. In 2018, our Board operations generated A840.8 million in sales or 87.0% of our total sales in 2018. We have established a strong and long-standing customer base, with some of our customer relationships dating back to the beginning of our operations in 1992. We have grown with our large German customers and have also successfully entered into new relationships with key customers outside of Germany. Today we supply 350 to 400 different Board customers. In 2018, our five largest Board customers accounted for approximately 20% and our ten largest Board customers for approximately 28% of our corrugated board sales by volume. The same year, our largest single customer generated approximately 7% of our total corrugated board sales by volume. We have established long-term strategic business relationships with many of our largest corrugated board customers. We believe that our ability to provide reliable delivery of high-quality, cost-effective and tailor-made products and being a family-owned business have enabled us to foster strong partnerships of mutual dependence with our mostly family-owned customers, operating as a fundamental part of their supply chains by improving inventory management, security of supply and customer service. However, consistent with industry practice, our business relationships are not governed by long-term agreements with fixed prices and sales volumes. We believe that our differentiated business model is particularly beneficial for many of our small to medium-sized customers with a decentralized production. For some of our larger customers that purchase a high percentage (typically 70% or more) of their corrugated board requirements from us, we offer predictable pricing for our corrugated board products through index pricing arrangements. In addition, at some of our corrugated board production sites, certain long-standing customers have established their own box manufacturing plants in immediate proximity to our site, either on our own land or on land adjacent to our site (so-called ‘‘packaging park’’). As a variation of this traditional packaging park model, we commenced production in October 2015 at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which we established in immediate proximity to an existing packaging plant of our customer, Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk, on land owned by our customer. As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced production in the first quarter of 2017 at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we purchased from our large customer Janmar Centrum adjacent to its existing packaging plant. All versions of the packaging park model help us to further strengthen our relationships with key customers and benefit both us and the relevant customers. The high level of integration between our own corrugated board production and the box production of our customers also made possible through the packaging park model creates a number of efficiencies and largely eliminates freight and other logistics costs between Board and our packaging park customers. Our packaging park customers also typically purchase a very high percentage (up to 100%) of their corrugated board requirements for the relevant box plant from us, which means predictable, high volume orders and consistently high utilization levels for the relevant corrugated board production sites. To ensure a 146 ----- predictable pricing mechanism for all parties, we also typically have index pricing arrangements with our packaging park customers. In 2018, approximately 11% of our total volume sales by surface area were generated under index pricing arrangements with our customers. The prices under these arrangements are linked to a containerboard market price index. Although these arrangements generally do not involve minimum sales volumes, demand levels are typically stable and we are in regular contact with our customers to ensure we have reasonable visibility over sales volumes for the upcoming year. In addition, approximately 19% of our volume sales by surface area in 2018 were attributable to packaging park customers. Customers accounting for approximately 69% of our volume sales by surface area in 2018 submitted their orders electronically and communicated directly with our IT systems via e-box, which offers those customers certain benefits in terms of order processing and tracking. It typically takes approximately two to three months for containerboard mills to pass on their raw material price increases to their customers, i.e., manufacturers of corrugated board. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for corrugated board manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases on to their customers. 147 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

Therefore, energy cost stated above differ from the energy cost shown as part of cost of materials. (2) In 2016, we re-classified certain accounts within operating expenses in further development of our investor reporting. As a result, the way we calculate freight expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 as presented in the table above differs slightly from the way we previously calculated them. Other procurement items, such as starch or maintenance services, accounted for an aggregate of A143 million in 2017 and A152 million in 2018. Most of our procurement and purchasing activities are concentrated in a centralized purchasing organization at our headquarters in Landau, which is responsible for purchasing containerboard, freight services, energy as well as other supplies. In addition, our two paper mills in Burg and Eisenh¨uttenstadt have local purchasing departments that are responsible for ‘‘technical’’ purchases, including starch, chemicals, maintenance services as well as other technical supplies. Our local purchasing department at our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt also centrally handles all purchases of recycled paper for the Group. By centralizing many of our purchasing activities, we aim to maximize our purchasing power, while at the same time building a high degree of expertise. The markets and prices for the most important production costs in our business, such as containerboard, energy and recycled paper, are driven by international supply and demand and require Group-wide purchasing strategies in order to optimize results. Our strategies include a mixture of mid-term supply contracts and spot purchasing of raw materials. The main raw material for the production of containerboard is recycled paper. As described above, all recycled paper for the Group is purchased centrally by our local purchasing department at our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt. In 2017 and 2018, Paper purchased a total of approximately 1,133,000 tons and 1,121,000 tons, respectively, of recycled paper from a broad portfolio of more than 50 suppliers. Prices for recycled paper have been highly volatile in the past. By improving our supplier portfolio management, we have been able to improve our average purchasing conditions in recent years. In making our purchasing decisions with respect to recycled paper, we can choose from a wide variety of suppliers. For the bulk recycled paper grades B12 and B19, we have entered into long-term supply agreements with a volume of 1,163,200 tons, which we expect to cover effectively all our related requirements. We purchase approximately 9% of our total recycled paper requirements under fixed volume contracts with a term of between one and four years and either fixed prices or index-linked prices. For approximately 49% of our total recycled paper purchases, we renegotiate prices on a monthly basis. Approximately 51% of our recycled paper purchases involve prices linked to relevant indices, such as Euwid or indices published by the German Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt). The main input cost for our production of corrugated board is containerboard. In 2017 and 2018, Board purchased approximately 1,073,000 tons and 1,227,000 tons, respectively, of containerboard. Approximately 75% to 85% of which were supplied internally by Paper. The remainder was purchased 149 ----- from a portfolio of approximately 30 external containerboard suppliers. External purchases of containerboard primarily involved purchases of kraftliner and white testliner. To reduce transportation costs for shipments of containerboard from our paper mills to our corrugated board production sites, we also enter into swap agreements with other containerboard producers from time to time. By maintaining a high share of internally sourced containerboard, we can ensure a consistently high quality of the containerboard we use, which has a positive impact on the operational performance of the equipment we use in our corrugated board production processes. In addition, our own containerboard production capabilities at Paper allow us to cater to the specific needs of our corrugated board production at Board.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

The operation of our two paper mills accounted for 91% of the total energy consumption of all our production sites (i.e. not including energy consumption of our headquarters in Landau) in 2018, and the operation of our ten corrugated board productions sites at that time together with our CHP accounted for the remainder. Electricity and steam are the primary forms of energy required for our production operations. Notwithstanding increases in production volumes, our energy costs have declined in recent years for a variety of reasons, including (i) our efforts to reduce energy consumption, in particular with regard to PM2, (ii) falling energy prices, (iii) the optimization of our energy procurement processes, (iv) the optimization of the operating costs of the CHP, in particular with regard to ash disposal, as well as (v) the full utilization of all available accommodations, credits and refunds under applicable energy laws and regulations. For more information about our energy management efforts, see ‘‘—Sustainability Focus; _Research and Development’’._ In addition, the CHP ensures a reliable, long-term supply of steam to PM2. As a back-up solution for the supply of steam in case of a maintenance or other shutdown of the CHP, a nearby power plant in Eisenh¨uttenstadt can also supply steam to the PM2. The CHP Acquisition was a significant further step in our efforts to optimize our cost structure as significantly reduced our energy costs as a result of the CHP Acquisition. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— _Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—The CHP Acquisition’’. Other energy supply agreements we_ enter into typically have a maximum term of one year. For larger energy procurement quantities, we may make use of tranche models to contract for annual volumes at different times, for different tranches and prices of our total energy requirements and for different periods.

We meet our freight and logistics requirements mainly through the use of external logistics companies and, to a much lesser extent, our own fleet of currently 59 trucks. Due to the relatively large size and weight of our products compared to value, freight and logistics expenses play an important role in the profitability of our business. The selection and commissioning of our external logistics partners is centrally organized by our logistics department in Landau, supported by our logistics specialists at Logistics in Burg. The support of our own team of logistics specialists at Logistics also provides us with real-time insight into the latest developments in the market for transportation services, which allows us to strategically employ the use of our own fleet of trucks. In addition, our own fleet gives us the ability to cover temporary capacity constraints in the market. Other targeted optimization measures which have resulted in a reduction of related transportation costs include (i) the development of specialized transport cradles for our containerboard rolls, which allow for a more efficient use of the cargo hold of each truck, (ii) the hiring of trucks with cargo holds best suited for our transportation needs, (iii) improved journey planning and (iv) better coordination of loading and offloading times. 150 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

A central element of our sales efforts is the provision of strong customer support for our existing customer base and the establishment and maintenance of strong relationships with purchasing managers and other key decision makers within our customers’ organizations. Other key elements of our sales efforts involve winning new customers, especially in new markets, and the introduction of new products. To ensure we meet the targets defined by our management, we have implemented a sales management system within our sales organization that is designed to monitor our performance against our volume targets. In addition, we have implemented a centralized pricing system to ensure a proper framework for achieving our sales and margin targets. Our marketing team supports our sales team and provides it with market-focused concepts and a full set of marketing tools. In addition to supporting the Group-wide targets defined by our management, our marketing efforts are also aimed at further strengthening our product brands (e.g., Progroup Paper, Progroup Board, Progroup Logistics, next fibre�, next board� and next box�) and maximizing their value. A key condition for a consistent brand image is the presentation of a clear and consistent external appearance, which we try to ensure through a full package of coordinated marketing tools and marketing activities. We believe this also benefits our packaging customers, as it can help support their own product marketing with their end-customers.

201,Offerings 2019.md,1182,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT,1182.1,,1182.1.1,,"As described above, we principally generate revenue through the sale of containerboard and corrugated board. Our mills primarily sell the containerboard we produce to Group-owned converting operations and we sell our corrugated board to our third-party customers in the packaging industry. The operation of our production plants as well as our sales and service activities depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex and sophisticated computer, telecommunication and data processing systems. Our value chain starts with recycled paper, which is the primary raw material in the production of containerboard. In managing our supply of raw materials, we need to constantly monitor our internal needs for containerboard, which we primarily meet through our own mills in Burg and Eisenh¨uttenstadt as well as, to a much more limited extent, third party containerboard producers. Between each of the further steps along the value chain and our production process, we need to coordinate and monitor complex logistics processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and products. This includes the shipment of large rolls of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated board plants at ten other locations in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom as well as the shipment of our finished corrugated board to our customers in the packaging industry (box plants). Our corrugated board plants process up to approximately 4,600 individual customer orders for corrugated board each day with a total volume of approximately 9.88 million square meters. At each plant, we prepare and load up to 90 truckloads of corrugated board every day. Our IT infrastructure needs to be able to support all these processes, including by helping us to optimize: - our use of raw materials (raw material management); - our production planning and production control (minimization of cutting scrap); - our warehouse management for both raw materials and finished products; as well as - the coordination of loading and offloading times. In 2018, approximately 69% of purchase orders for corrugated board from our Board customers were received electronically (69% in 2017), and all material core processes, which need to be coordinated and timed efficiently to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of our production processes, are being controlled by our central WEPAFORM-server and by local WEPAFORM servers at each plant. WEPAFORM is our proprietary core ERP system we use across the Group and which implements our internal know-how in the form of best practices and rules of conduct. The functionality of WEPAFORM covers all our core processes, including order processing, raw materials planning, production planning, production control as well as warehousing, shipment and invoicing. WEPAFORM implements both the rules of conduct of our individual departments as well as those rules of conduct that apply Group-wide, which ensures the implementation of our Group-wide business strategies. 151 ----- For example, in response to a requested delivery date in a customer purchase order, we try to automate, as much as possible, the confirmation of the actual delivery date for products covered by the relevant order. This actual delivery date will be determined based on a combination of factors, such as optimal transportation planning (including with regard to load capacity, offloading times and punctuality) as well as optimal production planning (i.e., feasibility and minimization of cutting scrap). This determination, in turn, will take account of all other pending orders at the time as well as the availability of freight options. All these complex determinations are controlled and automated through WEPAFORM. While all our core processes are covered by our proprietary WEPAFORM system and we use our e-box platform for purchase order related electronic communications with our Board customers, we also use a number of additional software applications to support other business processes, including standard non-proprietary applications for accounting (SAP), payroll processing (LOGA) and equipment maintenance (MAXIMO) and transport management for Logistics (Carlo). To support the various software applications we use within the Group, including WEPAFORM, we operate our own data centers. Our main data center is located in Offenbach a.d. Queich, Germany, and is connected to our headquarters in Landau, Germany, with a dedicated line. All our German sites are connected via leased MPLS lines to our main data center, while our foreign production sites are connected to our main data center via VPN over the Internet. At our site in Burg, Germany, we operate a local area network (LAN) which connects our local containerboard (Board), corrugated board (Paper) and logistics operations (Logistics) and which, in turn, is connected to our main data center via leased MPLS lines. To reduce the risk of a disruption of individual Internet connections between our various facilities and our main data center, we maintain alternative back-up Internet routes for each facility. Additionally, to ensure business continuity on application level for our core production processes, we operate WEPAFORM manufacturing execution processes edge datacenters in our plants in case of network issues. To host our software applications, we use ESX-Server farm based on NETAPP Storage systems. Relevant software applications are made available remotely to all users with the Progroup network via CITRIX XenApp. In 2018, our IT department employed an average of 20 employees (16 in 2017), including management positions, team leaders, administrative assistants and software developers. In addition, we worked with five external IT consultants and, with regard to the non-proprietary applications we use, cooperated with the relevant software developers and their partners. Given the strong reliance of our business on information technology, the success of our business depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain qualified IT personnel in the long-term, which has been challenging in the past given an increasing shortage of qualified personnel, especially in Germany.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,1183,SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,1183.1,,1183.1.1,,"Promoting the sustainability of our core businesses, i.e., the production of containerboard and corrugated board, has been a key priority for our Group, not only from an environmental perspective, but also as a matter of pure economic necessity. Containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer, and this standardization has led to intensified price competition within our industry. In addition, our operating results are significantly impacted by the containerboard and corrugated board industry’s historical cyclical pattern, with periods of overcapacity and resulting pressure on the pricing of our products. These pressures can be further exacerbated by significant volatility in our key input costs, in particular the cost of recycled paper, energy costs and freight costs. As a result, we are forced to continuously improve our product designs, optimize the utilization of our assets and explore new ways to further reduce our input costs. In practice, this means that we are undertaking significant and ongoing efforts to further reduce the use of fibre (i.e., recycled paper) in our products as well as the amount of energy required for our production processes and the shipment of our products, which helps us both to maintain a cost leadership position within our industry (with the goal of safeguarding our profit margins) and to help the environment by reducing our CO2 footprint. As a result of the factors described above, we believe there are general ‘‘mega trends’’ towards lighter and more functional packaging and towards a more efficient use of resources. The trend towards ‘‘light paper’’ (i.e., containerboard) has been particularly strong in Germany and has been further strengthened by high growth rates in e-commerce, which have led to an increase in demand for light and safe packaging solutions. We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany (PM2), which specializes in the production of super-light-weight to medium 152 ----- weight containerboard with grammages of 60-130g/m[2]. With regard to the production of super-light-weight containerboard (with a grammage below 90g/m[2]), which is currently particularly sought-after in the market, we believe that our paper machine PM2 gives us a significant advantage over many of our competitors, both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Based on a study by Vision Hunters, we believe PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machine for recycled super-light-weight paper and has set five new world records since its launch in 2010. Our subsidiary Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, which operates our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, is certified under the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (‘‘EMAS’’), a voluntary scheme set up by the European Union that is designed to help companies to continuously improve their environmental performance. The EMAS certification of Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH also carries several advantages for our business. Among other advantages, it (i) results in simplified reporting obligations under the German Federal Emission Law (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, ‘‘BImSchG’’), (ii) allows us to take advantage of certain accommodations and credits under the German Renewable Energy Law (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’) and the German Co-Generation Law (Kraft-W¨arme_Kopplungsgesetz, ‘‘KWKG’’), (iii) serves as the basis for certain energy tax refunds in Germany, (iv) allows us to take advantage of certain fee discounts in connection with certain regulatory approval processes in Germany, and (v) generally improves our corporate image as an ‘‘eco-friendly’’ company. The current EMAS certification for our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and Progroup Power 1 GmbH is valid until July 4, 2020 and June 4, 2020, respectively . To support the EMAS certification of Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH as well as other environmental certifications and to generally improve our energy management, we have implemented energy management systems (‘‘EnMS’’) at our two paper mills in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and Burg, the operation of which is particularly energy intensive, as well as all of our corrugated board production sites. In addition to the advantages described above, the implementation of EnMS at our various sites also has the following benefits for our business: (i) it helps us monitor compliance with applicable environmental regulations, (ii) increases the transparency of our internal production processes, (iii) enables a clear allocation of internal responsibilities and tasks, (iv) serves as the basis for potential efficiency improvements by helping us identify potential cost savings, and (v) reduces the risk of potential environmental liability. The containerboard produced by both our two paper mills is also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). In addition, we spent significant time, expense and effort developing a ‘‘green’’ range of ‘‘next generation’’ products working in a close cooperation with BHS Corrugated GmbH, one of our equipment suppliers, and a team of researchers at the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f¨ur angewandte _Wissenschaften) in Regensburg, Germany, over a period of several years. We market the resulting products_ under our own brands next fibre�, next board� and next box�. All these product innovations involve the use of the super-light-weight containerboard produced by our paper machine PM2 as well as innovative flute designs/corrugated board formats. Next fibre� is the brand under which we market a new generation of super-light-weight containerboard produced by our paper machine PM2. Our goal in developing this new generation of containerboard was to minimize the amount of fibre and energy used in its production, while at the same time maximizing its performance. The result of our efforts is a much lighter containerboard with consistently high paper homogeneity and a much optimized production process in terms of energy consumption, repulping and moisture monitoring. In addition, T UV Rheinland, an independent German standards organization,[¨] certified significant reductions in the CO2 footprint for our next fibre� containerboard, specifically a 52% reduction in CO2 emissions per ton of paper produced compared to conventional containerboard. In addition, next fibre� containerboard features significantly more roll weight running meters per containerboard roll during transport as a result of the reduced weight, resulting in further reductions in CO2 emissions by 11% and 24% for grammages of 90g/m[2] and 80g/m[2], respectively. Next board� is the brand under which we market our new generation of corrugated board products produced with our next fibre� containerboard. Due to a combination of the use of the lighter containerboard and innovative and improved flute designs and general board architecture, this range of corrugated boards is not only lighter than conventional corrugated board, but also offers our customers better performance characteristics, a better surface and printability, lower logistics costs and a better life-cycle assessment. The improvements due to the new board designs include edge crush resistance (ECT) values which are up to 15% higher compared to conventional corrugated board with the same weight/raw material content. Next board� products also feature an average reduction in CO2 emissions per ton of corrugated board of 15% compared to conventional corrugated board, as certified by T UV[¨] Rheinland, a 5% reduction in CO2 emissions during transport and a 16% increase in the loadable 153 ----- corrugated board surface area, meaning that approximately one in every seven truck journey can potentially be avoided. Next box� is a label we make available to our packaging customers they can use for eco-friendly and sustainable packaging produced with our next board� corrugated board products. Next board� corrugated board allows for more exact processing compared to comparable conventional corrugated board, as well as more reliable machinability and higher running rates. Next box� packaging features a smooth look without any ripple effect and permits optimal printing results due to our improved corrugated board designs. In addition, next box� products allow for more efficient storage and reduce transportation costs due to the reduced raw material content. We believe that sustainability and eco-friendliness are of increasing importance to our customers, especially in Germany. To allow our customers in the packaging industry as well as their end-users to highlight their own commitment to sustainability, we therefore make our next box�—reduced CO2 label available to them, which can be stamped on all next box� packaging.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

In Germany, the construction and operation of our paper mills requires active permits under the Federal Emissions Protection Act (Bundes_Immissionsschutzgesetz, ‘‘BImSchG’’), which encompasses various approvals necessary for the construction and operation of facilities pursuant to other laws, including public-law approvals, registrations and consents. The operation of the relevant facility can generally not be challenged or contested by third parties as long as the respective facility operates in compliance with its permit. In such cases, third parties can only require certain measures to mitigate any negative impact of a facility on the environment. To the extent such measures are impossible or uneconomical to implement based on state-of-the-art technology, the relevant third parties may only claim damages. Permits and additional administrative orders under the Federal Emissions Protection Act may impose certain limitations (e.g., stricter requirements with regard to permissible emissions or the use of the relevant facilities), with which we have to comply. To the extent new legal standards are introduced, permits will not be grandfathered but adjusted so they meet the relevant new standards. A violation of the operator’s duties as determined in the respective permit (or an additional administrative order) or a modification of the relevant legal standards may also lead to a restriction or, in severe cases, a prohibition of the further operation of the facility and/or the revocation of its permit under certain circumstances. The competent authority may also impose administrative fines or even ask for removal of the facility. Moreover, the operation of our two paper mills is subject to the various duties of the Federal Water Management Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz, ‘‘WHG’’), the State Water Acts in each of the German states (Landeswassergesetze) and the respective federal and/or state ordinances (Rechtsverordnungen). These regulations govern our use of water during production. According to the Federal Water Management Act, as well as the corresponding State (L¨ander) laws, the use of water generally requires the approval by the competent authority. In particular, the extraction of above-ground water, the discharge of waste water and the pouring and discharge of materials are all aspects of our containerboard production that require regulatory approval. In cases of violations of the relevant provisions, we may be required to pay damages or become subject to penalties. Depending on the type of permit, it may be limited in time and it may either be revoked any time or only under certain circumstances. The CHP in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (Power) also requires various regulatory approvals for its operation, particularly under the BImSchG and the 17[th] Ordinance to the BImSchG on the incineration and co-incineration of waste. Furthermore, operations have to comply with the applicable greenhouse gas emissions caps.

The use of these materials and devices is common in the paper industry as well as in other industries. They are applied in enclosed form, i.e., isotopes are enclosed by a protective cover to avoid any release of radiation. When the isotopes are not in use, they are further shielded with steel plates. According to Sec. 7 of the Radiation Protection Ordinance, the handling of the relevant radioactive isotopes requires permits, which we have obtained.

In addition, we are subject to the provisions of the German Chemicals Act (Gesetz zum Schutz vor _gef¨ahrlichen Stoffen—Chemikaliengesetz, ‘‘ChemG’’) and related ordinances (Rechtsverordnungen). The_ Chemicals Act is intended to minimize the risks from chemicals for humans and the environment. Based on the Chemicals Act and related regulations, the competent authorities have the power to—among others—require that certain materials or chemicals (i) may either not be produced, marketed or used at all, (ii) may only be produced, marketed or used in a certain manner or for specific purposes, (iii) may only be used under certain circumstances or (iv) may only be distributed to certain persons.

There is no general statutory ranking as to which of the aforementioned parties is primarily liable. Rather, this decision is made at the discretion of the relevant local authority who will take into account the effectiveness of remediation as a prevailing factor. Thus, the current owner of the contaminated property is usually the first party to be held responsible because the owner is generally in the best position to undertake the necessary remediation work. However, the other responsible parties are required to indemnify the party that carried out the remediation work, regardless of which party is held liable by the relevant local authority. Where no other arrangements are agreed upon, the obligation to provide compensation and the extent of the compensation to be provided depend on the extent to which the hazard or damage was caused primarily by one party or the other. Liability is not based on fault. Thus, the BBodSchG does not require the relevant local authority to prove negligence or intent on the part of the liable parties.

201,Offerings 2019.md,1185,REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT,1185.5,Regulation governing the Operation of the CHP,1185.5.2,Energy Industry Act (EnWG) and related regulation,"The EnWG provides, inter alia, the legal framework for ensuring competition within the German energy markets, mainly by regulating electricity and gas networks to ensure reliable and efficient supply networks. It also implements relevant EU law in relation to energy supply. Companies that supply third parties with energy or own or operate transmission and distribution networks have to ensure that electricity is supplied in accordance with these aims. _Grid access and network tariffs_ As grid operators enjoy a natural monopoly, electricity grid operators are obligated to provide connection to and use of electricity grids without discrimination and in a transparent manner. Electricity grid operators are required to connect third parties, such as generation facilities (including the CHP), to the grid. The conditions for a connection must be non-discriminatory, proportionate, transparent and not less favorable than the conditions granted to a grid operator’s own, affiliated or associated undertakings. A grid operator may refuse the connection if it is, for operational or other economic or technical reasons, impossible or unreasonable. The burden of proving that a connection is economically or technically impossible or unreasonable lies with the grid operator. Tariffs for grid access are determined by the grid operators in accordance with incentive regulation based on the ARegV and the StromNEV. Under these regulations, revenue caps are set by the regulatory authority for each grid operator for a regulatory period of up to five years based on the cost base of the business three years prior to the start of the regulatory period. The revenue cap displays the average total costs of the grid use in consideration of permanent non influenceable costs (e.g. tax, duties), temporary non influenceable costs, and influenceable costs (also referred to as ‘‘inefficiencies’’). Besides potential profit from cost reductions, the grid operators can gain a reasonable interest from the used capital. The provisions of the StromNEV and the Ordinance on Tariffs for Gas Grid Access (Gasnetzentgeltverordnung) define how to assess the level of the equity interest rate (Eigenkapitalverzinsung) before each regulation period. The equity interest rates are set by the German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur, ‘‘BNetzA’’). For the third regulation periods for gas (2018 to 2022) and for electricity (2019 to 2023), the BNetzA has significantly reduced the equity interest rates. These amendments have led to significant controversies within the energy industry and appeals have been filed at the competent Higher Regional Court of D¨usseldorf (Oberlandesgericht D¨usseldorf, ‘‘OLG D¨usseldorf’’) by distribution and transmission system operating companies that are or will be affected by the decrease of the equity interest rate. According to the ruling of the OLG D¨usseldorf of March 22, 2018 the reduction of the equity interest rates was unlawful. Currently, the case is pending before the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof, ‘‘BGH’’), after the BNetzA had lodged an appeal against the OLG D¨usseldorf’s ruling. A decision is announced to be released on July 9, 2019. _Grid operators’ rights in case of congestion and emergency_ Pursuant to the EnWG, electricity grid operators are obliged to ensure the security and reliability of the grid. Therefore, they are entitled and required to take the necessary actions to avoid any risks to the security or reliability of the grid. If the security or reliability of the grid is endangered or disturbed, grid operators are required and authorized to rectify the problem by making use of (i) grid-related measures, which entail technical measures that do not involve the network users, such as internal energy balancing or pressure adjustment; and/or (ii) market-related measures which involve certain network users. Marketrelated measures are based on contractual agreements between the grid operator and certain users relating to the feed in and off-take of energy which allow energy balancing and making use of interruptible capacities (capacity bookings which are not firm and, therefore, may be interrupted). If the grid operator 157 ----- cannot eliminate the disturbance by making use of any of these measures, the operator is entitled to adjust and/or reduce feed-ins, electricity transits and electricity off-takes without any obligation to pay compensation. In principle, feed-ins from conventional generation must be reduced before feed-ins from co-generation facilities (such as the CHP) or renewable energy facilities. However, if the grid operator has unreasonably rejected proposals by generation installation operators to conclude agreements on interruptible capacities, compensation must be paid by the grid operator. Furthermore, compensation must be paid to co-generation and renewable energy installations in case of a reduction of feed-ins if disturbances are caused due to grid congestion. _Relevant Amendments of the EnWG and related developments since 2016_ In 2016, the EnWG was amended by the Electricity Market Act (Strommarktgesetz), inter alia, to strengthen the principle of free pricing in the electricity markets, to establish the basis for further reporting requirements for market participants (including power plant operators) under a central electronic directory of energy-related data (the so-called _Marktstammdatenregister (‘‘MaStR’’)), and to implement certain safety measures regarding capacity reserves (namely the so-called ‘‘Kraftwerksreserve’’, ‘‘Netzreserve’’ and the ‘‘Braunkohlereserve’’) to ensure the availability of sufficient power capacity. In adopting the amendments, the German legislator essentially affirmed the existing market model (Energy-only-Market, ‘‘EOM’’), rejecting calls to implement a wide capacity market in response to recent turbulences for conventional (co-generation) power plant operators caused by the increases in renewable energy generation and the significant drop in prices in the electricity wholesale markets. Based on Sections 111e and 111f of the EnWG, the regulation on the _MaStR (Marktstammdatenregisterverordnung, ‘‘MaStRV’’) entered into force on July 1, 2017. All actors in the electricity and gas market must register in the directory (Marktstammdatenregister, ‘‘MaSTR’’) for all stationary technical facilities that generate, store or consume electricity or gas. The MaStR creates a comprehensive regulatory register for the electricity and gas market that can be used by public authorities and market actors in the energy sectors. The recourse to the master data of the MaStR represents a significant increase in data quality and data simplification for many energy industry processes. Many regulatory reporting requirements can be standardized, simplified or completely abolished by centralized registration. The MaStR is still under construction. Electricity and gas network operators can only currently register their company in the MaStR web portal. The MaStR has been opened to the market players on January 31, 2019. All market players, depending on the date of their commissioning process (before/after July 1, 2017), are obliged to register or to verify the existing data, at the latest by January 31, 2021. To further support the functioning of electricity markets, the German Renewable Energies Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’) has also been revised multiple times. The most significant amendments include the definition of expansion targets and the progressive transition to a comprehensive tendering system for all renewable energy technologies. The EEG provides for certain exemptions from the energy surcharge for energy-intensive industries. In 2016, the EEG was amended, lowering the required electricity cost intensity for such exemptions from 17% to 14% as of 2017 for certain industries, such as the manufacture of paper and containerboard. The exemptions in the EEG have to comply with the European environmental energy state aid guidelines which are valid until 2020 in the current version. Furthermore, the German provisions have to meet the requirements established by the Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Renewable Energy Directive). Further amendments of the EEG 2016 came into force on January 1, 2017 (‘‘EEG 2017’’). The EEG 2017 contains two essential innovations. The remuneration of renewable electricity will primarily be regulated by tenders in future, i.e. the amount of subsidy will be determined by the market and no longer by fixed feed-in remuneration. That ensures the continuous expansion of renewable energies and can reduce the costs of funding provided there is enough competition. Furthermore, the expansion of renewable energies is synchronized with grid expansion. For each technology, certain expansion paths have been set in accordance to the available network capacities. In addition, the expansion of wind power on land in areas with network bottlenecks (Netzengpassgebiete) was limited. Most recently, the EEG has been amended by a comprehensive legislative package, the so-called _Energiesammelgesetz (‘‘EnSaG’’), which includes amendments of different laws in Germany and entered into force at the end of 2018. As regards the EEG, among others, the expansion paths for wind onshore and photovoltaics have been adjusted. Further, additional tenders regarding these technologies for the years 2019 to 2021 have been implemented. Also, the so-called innovation tenders have been upgraded through larger tender volumes, while the funding tariffs for rooftop photovoltaic systems have been cut. For the self-production of electricity, which under certain conditions is (partially) exempt from the so-called EEG-Umlage (the EEG surcharge), provisions on the metering (or estimate) of own and of third-party electricity consumptions 158 ----- have been introduced. In light of a recent judgment of the European Court of Justice of March 28, 2019, according to which the EEG (2012) does not contain subsidies, it is conceivable that the legal framework will further be revised by the German legislator taking into account that the strict requirements under state aid law do not (directly) apply to the German funding system. Apart from the amendments of the EnWG and the EEG, (already in 2016) the foundation was laid for the digital transformation of the energy system. With the Act on the Digitization of the Energiewende (Gesetz zur_ _Digitalisierung_ _der_ _Energiewende—‘‘GDEW’’),_ the Metering Point Operation Act (Messstellenbetriebsgesetz—‘‘MSbG’’) has been enacted, which contains provisions on the progressive roll-out of intelligent metering systems. However, implementation has so far been slow. Besides the developments on German national level, the European legislation has also been amended. On November 30, 2016, the European Commission published a proposal for a revised Renewable Energy Directive (COM(2016) 767 final) to make the EU a global leader in renewable energy and ensure that a target of at least 27% renewables in the gross final energy consumption in the EU by 2030 is met. On January 17, 2018 the European Parliament adopted various amendments to the European Commission’s proposal, in particular, to achieve an even more ambitious target of 35% renewables in the Union’s energy consumption by 2030. On December 11, 2018 the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union passed the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (Renewable Energy Sources Directive), which entered into force on December 24, 2018. The Member States are now required to implement this Directive by June 30, 2021 at the latest. In the context of the general reforms of the EnWG and the EEG it is noteworthy for conventional (co-generation) power plant operators, that the BNetzA and the European Regulation Authority (Agency for the Cooperation of the Energy Regulators—‘‘ACER’’) paved the way for a split of the common German-Austrian pricing zone from October 2018 by ordering grid operators to establish a congestion management at the German-Austrian border. This is due to the technical difficulties and the exploding costs regarding renewable energy that is being produced in the northern regions of Germany and transported to the high-consumption centers in the southern regions of Germany. If the common GermanAustrian pricing are ultimately split, this may result in higher wholesale electricity prices in the South of Germany. _Network Fees Modernization Act (NEMoG)_ On July 22, 2017, the Act on the Modernization of the Grid Tariff Structure (Netzentgeltmodernisierungsgesetz, ‘‘NEMoG’’) slightly amended the EnWG, the EEG and the StromNEV to align grid tariffs with the ‘‘Energiewende’’. The NEMoG contains two important aspects: The gradual standardization of transmission network charges and the abolishment of the privilege of the so-called ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ (vermiedene Netzentgelte). The transmission grid tariffs will gradually adjust nationwide. For implementation, the NEMoG contains an authorization for the enactment of a regulation by the German Federal Government (Bundesregierung) with consent of the German Federal Council (Bundesrat). The standardization of transmission grid tariffs will be effected in five steps starting from January 1, 2019. From January 1, 2023, the charges for the transmission grids will be uniform throughout Germany. The costs of the transmission grids currently amount to approx. 25% of the total costs of electricity grids. Furthermore, Section 120 EnWG stipulates the gradual reduction of ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’, the calculation bases of which will be frozen to the level of 2016 starting from 2018. Regarding the gradual reduction, a distinction is made between volatile (sun and wind) plants (Anlagen mit volatiler Erzeugung) and controllable generation plants (e.g. CHP). The ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ for new volatile plants are completely abolished since 2018 and for existing volatile plants it will be eliminated in three stages from 2018, i.e. that by 2020, volatile plants will no longer be eligible for ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ at all. Regarding controllable plants, ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ will not be granted to plants, which start their operation after December 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,1185,REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT,1185.5,Regulation governing the Operation of the CHP,1185.5.3,Co-Generation Act (KWKG),"In the interests of energy conservation, environmental protection and achieving the climate protection targets of the German Federal Government, the KWKG aims to increase the share of electricity generated through more environmentally-friendly co-generation facilities, such as the CHP, to 25% of the overall power generation in Germany by 2020. However, due to the drop in the wholesale electricity prices and 159 ----- due to the ongoing discussions on conventional electricity production, the 25%-target—as of now—will not be achieved. _Grid access and off-take_ Grid operators are required to give priority grid access to certain co-generation plant operators, including Progroup Power 1 GmbH as operator of the CHP, with the same priority as that granted to renewable energies and to off-take, transmit and distribute their co-generation electricity on a priority basis. Grid operators are required to off-take the electricity at (i) a price either mutually agreed or determined according to the ‘‘standard market price’’ (if no agreement is reached) plus (ii) a certain fixed surcharge and a payment for decentralized feed-in. See ‘‘—Off-take pricing’’ below. Notwithstanding the obligation to purchase, transmit and distribute electricity from co-generation plants and producers of renewable energy, a grid operator is required to ensure the technical stability of the grid and, for this purpose, is entitled to avoid an overload of the grid by managing the feed-in of electricity from all parties feeding electricity into its grid (feed-in/grid congestion management). If after exhausting certain grid-related and market-related measures, the grid operator has not successfully reduced the overload in the grid and congestion remains, it is entitled to reduce the electricity which can be fed into the grid. Within this mandatory reduction, the grid operator is required to treat the electricity from certain co-generation sources (including the CHP), from renewable energy sources (such as wind farms or solar energy) and from mine gas preferentially. The grid operator is required to implement congestion management by which, in principle, feed-in from installations using conventional energy resources (gas, coal, nuclear fuel) must be reduced first. The political parties forming the current German Federal Government have indicated in their coalition agreement that they intend to amend the legal framework for congestion management (including the rules for compensation, if any, to be paid) while maintaining the general concept of priority access for electricity from renewable sources, as well as from co-generation. In December 2016, the European Commission published the so-called Winter Package, which includes numerous proposals on legislative acts for energy efficiency and the energy markets. Among other proposal, the package includes a proposal to cancel the priority feed-in for co-generation and renewable energy plants with a capacity of more than 250 kilowatt, which start operating after the implementation of the legislative acts. _Off-take pricing_ The grid operator has an obligation to off-take the electricity produced at co-generation plants within the meaning of the KWKG, such as the CHP, at a price mutually agreed between the grid operator and the operator of the co-generation plant plus a surcharge. See ‘‘—Surcharge’’ below. In addition to the surcharge, the grid operator is required to pay so-called ‘‘avoided grid fees’’ due to the decentralized feed-in by the co-generation plant (‘‘Entgelt f¨ur dezentrale Einspeisung’’, Section 18 para 1 StromNEV). If no agreement is reached regarding the electricity price, the grid operator has to off-take the electricity at the ‘‘standard market price’’. The ‘‘standard market price’’ for electricity produced by installations depends on their capacity. For installations with a capacity of up to 2 MWe the average price of base-load electricity is determined by the European Energy Exchange (EEX) during the previous quarter of the year or installations with a capacity of more than 2 MWe—like the CHP—the ‘‘standard market price’’ (depends on the circumstances in the individual case, especially the plant’s mode of operation and the predictability of electricity production). If the co-generation plant operator demonstrates that a third party would be willing to pay a certain price for the electricity produced at the co-generation plant, the grid operator is obligated to purchase the electricity from the co-generation plant operator at this price. In turn, the third party is obliged to purchase the electricity at the price quoted from the grid operator. Thus, the sale of electricity to a third party is carried out through the grid operator as intermediary. The purchase price is actually paid by the third party and the grid operator only pays the surcharge. See ‘‘—Surcharge’’ below. _Surcharge_ In addition to the purchase price and the ‘‘avoided grid fees’’, grid operators are obligated to pay a legally determined surcharge to the co-generation plant operators, depending, inter alia, on the type of plant, the installed capacity and extent/costs of modernization and retrofitting measures. In contrast to the electricity price and the ‘‘avoided grid fee’’, which the grid operator is only required to pay for the electricity actually fed into the grid, the surcharge must be paid for the entire amount of electricity produced in 160 ----- co-generation. Depending on the type of the co-generation plant, the surcharge is payable for a certain maximum period of time. Plants with a capacity larger than 2 MWe receive the surcharge for a total of 30,000 hours of Full-Load equivalent (FLE). The KWKG places a cap on the annual aggregate level of financial incentives paid as surcharge under the KWKG. If this threshold is exceeded, surcharges for a certain class of co-generation plants are reduced. Subject to the cap, this loss in surcharges is generally paid in the full amount in the course of the following years before payment of the regular surcharge for these co-generation plants is initiated again. _Amendments of the KWKG and Associated Developments_ The KWKG was amended in recent time. - The KWKG 2016, which entered into force on January 1, 2016, amended the previous scheme of funding co-generation, albeit maintaining the rules on grid access and compulsory off-taking of electricity produced in co-generation. For the newly determined expansion paths, the cap for the annual aggregate level of financial incentives was raised from A750 million to A1,500 million. - On January 1, 2017, an amendment to the KWKG 2016 entered into force. Most importantly, a tendering system similar to the one under the revised EEG has been established for co-generation plants with an electric capacity of 1 to 50 megawatt as well as for innovative CHP systems. This mainly concerns combined heat and power plants (including the CHP), which feed into the general supply network. Furthermore, the scheme for the reduction of the so-called _KWK-Umlage (a surcharge, which socializes the costs for the funding of CHP to the end consumers of electricity) for the electricity-intensive industries was adapted to the one in place for the so-called _EEG-Umlage. For more information, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Industry and our Business—As a result _of the CHP Acquisition, we are directly subject to a wide range of laws and regulations specifically governing the German energy sector and the disposal of waste, which are subject to constant change’’._ - The most recent amendment of the KWKG was introduced by the above-mentioned EnSaG, which entered into force by the end of 2018. With this act, among others, the funding of the construction and modernization of CHP installations was extended to 2025. In addition to these KWKG reforms, the German legislator passed the NeMoG, which includes a revision of Section 18 StromNEV regarding ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’. In particular, a cap was placed on ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ to prevent the relevant tariffs from exceeding the 2016 level. Also it was stipulated to progressively cancel the ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ for existing respectively for new plants. For details, see ‘‘—NeMoG’’ above.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,1185,REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT,1185.5,Regulation governing the Operation of the CHP,1185.5.4,Carbon Emission Compliance,"Germany is party to the Kyoto Protocol as well as to the Paris Agreement, and the Emission Trading Directive 2003/87/EC intends to considerably reduce the output of greenhouse gases. It was transformed into German law by implementing it into the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz, ‘‘TEHG’’). The TEHG introduces an emission trading system (‘‘ETS’’) for CO2 emission allowances which are traded in certain trading periods, which requires certain energy and industry sectors to comply with the applicable greenhouse gas emissions caps. Overall, only a limited number of allowances—determined in advance for the trading period—are available to emission sources, subject to the emission trading system. Participation in this system has been mandatory since 2005 for all industries with high energy consumption levels, including the paper industry. The regulations of the TEHG state that sources under emission trading obligation are required to obtain approval to emit greenhouse gases, to comply with a cap of emission allowances allocated to them and to maintain a monitoring process to determine and to document their emissions. The legislation also provides for the possibility of trading (selling and buying) excess allowances in the open market and allows for offsets from Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism projects as regulated by the German Project Mechanisms Act to be used in place of emission allowances to a certain extent, which is limited for existing installations to the quota granted for the second trading period (22% of the allocation for the second trading period), to the extent not yet used. Like our two paper mills, the CHP is subject to the ETS. The overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge has been significantly reduced during the second trading period (2008 through 2012) and the third trading period that began in January 2013 compared to the amount of allowances allocated free of charge in the first trading period (2005 through 2007). Under the currently applicable ETS, the EU-wide quantity of emission allowances allocated 161 ----- each year reduced by a linear factor of 1.74% annually as compared to the average annual total quantity of emission allowances issued in the EU between 2008 and 2012. To achieve the target of cutting EU emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990, agreed by the European Council in October 2014 as part of the 2030 climate and energy framework, the cap will be lowered by 2.2% per year from 2021. In addition, from 2013 onwards, the auctioning of emission allowances has been and will continue to be introduced for the manufacturing sector. The quantities of emission allowances allocated free of charge will generally be reduced from 80% in 2013 to 30% in 2020.On March 14, 2018, the 2018 Directive (EU) 2018/410 amending the Emissions Trading Directive 2003/87/EC was adopted. According to the amended version of the Emissions Trading Directive, the free allocation of 30% will continue until 2025. Thereafter, the 30% of free allocation will subsequently be reduced to 0% until 2030, except for district heating. As a result, affected companies whose emissions exceed their emission allowances will have to purchase a significant, and steadily increasing, share of emission allowances in auctions, which may result in substantial additional cost for such companies. An exemption from the general auctioning mechanism is available for certain energy-intensive industries which are exposed to a significant risk of relocation of plants to countries with less stringent climate protection laws (a phenomenon known as ‘‘Carbon Leakage’’). Since 2010, the European Commission will determine every five years which industries are threatened by Carbon Leakage. The designated industries will be allocated emission allowances free of charge for the period determined amounting to 100%. Since the paper industry has been granted the relevant status, our two mills receive CO2 emission certificates free of charge. On February 15, 2019, the European Commission adopted the Carbon Leakage List for the years 2021-2030. According to this list, the paper industry will continue to be considered threatened by Carbon Leakage for this upcoming period. A part of the Carbon Leakage industry sectors are allowed to apply for financial compensation for the increase of electricity costs due to EU ETS allowance costs passed on in electricity prices, among which is the paper and paperboard industry. The compensation is not enforceable and is granted from funds provided in the federal budget for that purpose for the relevant year. For the fourth trading period (2021 to 2030), the Free Allocation Rules (FAR- (EU) 2019/331) have been adopted on December 19, 2018. Some details concerning the free allocation of certificates are still missing. For example, there are still no rules for adjusting the level of free allocations given to installations whose operations have increased or decreased, as assessed on the basis of a rolling average of two years, by more than 15% compared to the level initially used to determine the free allocation for the relevant period. The product benchmarks, which determine the amount of allowances allocated free of charge, will decline by 0.2 to 1.6% per year, calculated from the year 2008, in order to account for expected emission reductions due to technological progress. Nevertheless, according to an impact assessment of the European Commission, the paper and paperboard sector can still expect an 80% free allocation. It should be noted that the aforementioned Carbon Leakage list has not entered into force yet. After all, a final assessment as to the consequences is not possible yet. In February 2014, the Commission Regulation (EU) No 176/2014 entered into force postponing the auctioning of 900 million emission allowances from 2014 to 2016 to later in the third trading period. By Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of October 6, 2015, the European Parliament and the European Council have established a market stability reserve for the Union greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. According to this Decision, the quantity of 900 million allowances deducted from auctioning volumes during the period 2014-2016 will not be added to the volumes to be auctioned in 2019 and 2020 but will instead be placed in the reserve. Also, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 stipulates that each year a number of allowances equal to 12% of the total number of allowances in circulation, as published by the European Commission, will be deducted from the volume of allowances to be auctioned and will be placed in the reserve over a period of 12 months beginning on September 1 of that year, unless the number of allowances to be placed in the reserve would be less than 100 million. In any year, if the total number of allowances in circulation is less than 400 million, 100 million allowances will be released from the reserve and added to the volume of allowances to be auctioned. Where fewer than 100 million allowances are in the reserve, all allowances in the reserve will be released. Considering the need to deliver a credible investment signal to reduce CO2 emissions in a cost-efficient manner and with the aim of strengthening the EU ETS, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 was amended on March 14, 2018 by Directive (EU) 2018/410 so as to increase the percentage rates for determining the number of allowances to be placed each year in the reserve from 12% to 24% and the abovementioned threshold of 100 million allowances to 200 million allowances by 162 ----- December 31, 2023. Furthermore, allowances held in the reserve above the total number of allowances auctioned during the respective previous year should no longer be valid from 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

The party using energy products for the purpose of energy generation is the party eligible to obtain relief. The StromStG provides for the taxation of consumed electricity. The tax rate is A20.50 per MWh pursuant to Section 3 StromStG. Anyone supplying electricity is principally deemed to be a supplier; exceptions are laid down in sec. 1a Ordinance implementing the StromStG (Stromsteuerdurchf¨uhrungsverordnung, ‘‘StromStV’’). Pursuant to Section 4 subs. 1 sentence 1 StromStG, anyone intending to supply electricity as a supplier requires a license granted upon application by the main customs office. The supplier is obliged to submit a tax return for all electricity for which tax has arisen. In the context of this tax return, the supplier itself must calculate the amount of tax to be paid and settle the amount due with the tax office. Electricity that is removed from the grid for the purpose of generating electricity is tax-exempt if a license for removing electricity for the purpose of generating electricity was granted prior to the removal. Manufacturing companies within the meaning of Section 2 no. 3 StromStG may obtain tax relief pursuant to sec. 9b StromStG in the amount of A5.13 per MWh (if the amount of the relief exceeds A250.00 per calendar year) and an electricity tax relief of up to 90% pursuant to Section 10 StromStG (if the tax to be paid in the calendar year exceeds A1,000.00). The party which has removed electricity for operating purposes is the party eligible to obtain relief. In 2016, the Federal Ministry of Finance (Bundesministerium der Finanzen, ‘‘BMF’’) published a draft amendment of the EnergieStG and the StromStG, which foresaw certain limitations and restrictions regarding the aforementioned tax releases, among others a prohibition to combine the tax releases with other State aids (so-called cumulation). The draft has been heavily criticized by the BMWi and has therefore been revised by the BMF. It no longer included the problematic provision on the prohibition of cumulation. On January 1, 2018, the new EnergieStG and the StromStG entered into force without the controversial alteration. As a result, the amendments to the StromStV and the EnergieStV have been published on January 8, 2018 with retroactive effect from January 1, 2018. Key adjustments to the legal framework include—inter alia—provisions on the scope and conditions for the granting of subsidies to companies in difficulty (Unternehmen in Schwierigkeiten, ‘‘UIS’’), exceptions in the definition of suppliers, the regulation for a simplified application and authorization procedure for battery storage and the specification of the definition of ‘‘electromobility’’.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

In 2018, the VDE published new technical standards (Anwendungsregeln), which contain the recognized engineering standards for the grid access of, among others, generation units. According to a transitional regulation introduced with the above-mentioned EnSaG, those rules are applicable for generation units with an electric capacity of 0.8 kW and above, for which a grid access request is submitted to the grid operator or for which an approval according to BImSchG has been granted after April 27, 2019. They also apply if existing generation units are significantly changed. Depending on the individual case, new extensive certification obligations have to be fulfilled.

For more details, please also see ‘‘—Regulatory Environment—Environmental Laws’’ _and ‘‘—Regulatory _Environment—Soil Contamination’’ above._ The technological standards applicable in relation to the requirements under the BImSchG are substantiated by technical regulations as determined in ordinances based on the BImSchG or technical regulations, as amended from time to time. For the CHP, the 13[th] Ordinance (Ordinance on Large Combustion Plants, Gas Turbine Plants and Internal Combustion Engines) and the 17[th] Ordinance (Ordinance on the Incineration and Co-Incineration of Waste) to the BImSchG are of particular importance, the latter one particularly with regard to the co-incineration of sewage sludge. The legal framework for the utilization/disposal of sewage sludge is currently being revised with the aim of a better recovery of phosphates, which may lead to a declining use of sewage sludge in incineration plants. The compliance with emission limits, which are stipulated in the permit for the CHP, will be controlled regularly and, if necessary, can be altered subsequently by the authorities. The competent authority may withdraw the permit if the CHP does not comply with the applicable emission limits as determined in the permit. The BImSchG also specifies the obligations of certain installation operators to notify the competent authorities of operational disruptions and to implement a monitoring following such disruptions. Operators of industry emissions installations have to provide annual reports of their emissions monitoring to the competent authorities and there are environmental inspections on a regular basis for such installations. The Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control (Technische Anleitung Luft—‘‘TA Luft’’), which have to be followed by any installation falling under the BImschG (such as power plants), are under revision. However, in May 2017 the revision of the TA Luft was postponed by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (Bundesministerium f¨ur Umwelt, _Naturschutz, Bau und Reaktorsicherheit, ‘‘BMUB’’) for an undefined time.

Each of the shares of the Issuer carries one vote at the Issuer’s general shareholders’ meeting. There are no restrictions on voting rights of the shares of the Issuer. Unless mandatory provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act or the Articles of Association state otherwise, general shareholders’ meeting resolutions are passed with a simple majority of the votes cast. In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, resolutions of fundamental importance require, in addition to a simple majority of the votes cast, a majority of at least three quarters of the share capital represented in order to pass such a resolution. Such resolutions of fundamental importance include in particular: - changes in the Articles of Association; - share capital increases; - share capital decreases; - the creation of authorized or contingent capital; - divisions or split-offs as well as transfers of the entire assets of the Issuer; - conclusions of inter-company agreements (in particular, domination agreements and profit and loss transfer agreements); - changes in the legal form of the Issuer; and - liquidation of the Issuer. The general shareholders’ meeting can be convened at the request of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board, or shareholders whose shares together total at least 5% of the share capital. If the best interests of the Issuer require it, the Supervisory Board must call a general shareholders’ meeting. The regular general shareholders’ meeting takes place within the first eight months of every financial year.

201,Offerings 2019.md,1187,MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW,1187.10,,1187.10.1,,"In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), the Issuer has a two-tier board system consisting of an Executive Board (Vorstand) and a Supervisory Board (Aufsichtsrat). The two boards are separate, and, subject to a limited exception, no individual may serve concurrently as a member of both boards. The Executive Board is responsible for managing our day-to-day business in accordance with applicable German law and the Articles of Association (Satzung) as well as its rules of procedure (Gesch¨aftsordnung). In addition, the Executive Board must ensure appropriate control of risk within the Issuer and its subsidiaries in order that any developments jeopardizing the Issuer’s future as a going concern may be identified at an early stage. The Executive Board legally represents the Issuer in dealings with third parties and in court. The Supervisory Board advises the Executive Board on the management of the Issuer, monitors its conduct of business and is responsible for appointing and dismissing the members of the Executive Board for good cause. It also represents the Issuer in transactions between a member of the Executive Board and the Issuer. While the Executive Board is responsible for submitting regular reports on our business activities and fundamental issues relating to corporate planning (including financial, investment and personnel planning) to the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board has the right to request special reports at any time from the Executive Board. The Executive Board is also obliged to duly report to the Supervisory Board such transactions as may be of considerable importance to the Issuer’s profitability (in particular the return on equity) or liquidity, so that the Supervisory Board may have an opportunity to express its opinion on such transactions before they are concluded. The Supervisory Board may also request a report at any time on matters concerning the Issuer, on the legal and commercial relationships with affiliated companies or on commercial operations at these companies that may have a significant impact on the Issuer and its subsidiaries. The Supervisory Board generally may not exercise management functions. The rules of procedure of the Executive Board, however, require that certain types of transactions may not be carried out by the Executive Board without the prior consent of the Supervisory Board. If the Supervisory Board refuses to approve a certain transaction or business activity contemplated by the Executive Board, the Executive Board can request that the general shareholders’ meeting decide on the matter. However, the general shareholders’ meeting of a German stock corporation may not issue directives to the Executive Board. The members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board owe duties of loyalty and care vis-`a-vis the Issuer. In discharging their duties, the members of these corporate bodies must consider a broad range of interests, including our interests, which in turn include the interests of our shareholders, employees, creditors and, to a certain extent, the general public. The Executive Board must also take due account of the shareholders’ right to equal treatment and equal information. The members of the Executive Board or of the Supervisory Board are jointly and severally liable to the Issuer for any damages that may arise if they fail to discharge their duties. As a basic principle under German law, a shareholder has no direct recourse against the members of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board in the event that they breach a duty vis-`a-vis the Issuer. Except for certain special circumstances, only the Issuer itself has the right to bring claims for damages against members of either board, whereby the Issuer is represented by the Executive Board when bringing claims against the Supervisory Board and by the Supervisory Board when bringing claims against the Executive Board. Pursuant to a ruling by the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), the Supervisory Board is obliged to bring claims which are likely to be successful against the Executive Board unless material considerations pertaining to the interest of the corporation outweigh or are at least equivalent to those in favor of enforcing such claim. Despite a refusal of the Supervisory Board to pursue a claim for damages, such a claim must be enforced (i) upon a resolution of the general shareholders’ meeting, (ii) upon a petition with the competent court by minority shareholders meeting a certain minimum requirement as to their stake in the Issuer, or (iii) by the Issuer’s creditors whose claims could not be settled by the Issuer. The Issuer may only waive or settle such claims for damages if at least three years have passed and if the shareholders approve the waiver or settlement at the general shareholders’ meeting with a simple majority of the votes cast, provided that opposing shareholders do not hold, in the aggregate, one tenth or more of the share capital and do not have their opposition formally recorded in the minutes of the shareholders’ meeting. 166 ----- Under German law, no individual shareholder (or any other person) may exert its influence on the Issuer to cause a member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board to engage in any act detrimental to the Issuer. Shareholders with a controlling interest may not use it to cause the Issuer to act against its own interest unless the prejudice to its interests is compensated for. Any shareholder using its interest in the Issuer to cause a member of the Executive Board, a member of the Supervisory Board or a person who holds a power of attorney (Prokurist) or is authorized to act for the Issuer (Handlungsbevollm¨achtigter) to engage in any act detrimental to the Issuer or to our shareholders must compensate the Issuer and the shareholders for any loss sustained thereby. In addition, the members of the Executive Board and the members of the Supervisory Board are jointly and severally liable if they act in breach of their obligations.

Definitive notes representing",21.2.1,Security; Release of Collateral,"The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will initially be secured by the Issuer Share Pledges and the payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will be secured by Liens (subject to any Permitted Collateral Liens, applicable perfection requirements and exceptions and limitations described herein) over the collateral set out below (collectively, with the Issuer Share Pledges, the ‘‘Collateral’’): (a) pledges over the shares and stock interests, as applicable, in Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup Logistics GmbH, Progroup Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Board sp. z o.o., Progroup Board s.r.o., Progroup Board S.A.S. and Progroup Board Ltd.; (b) security interests over receivables of the Parent against the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries; (c) pledges over certain bank accounts with banks in Germany of the Issuer; (d) security interests over certain real property located in Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, as applicable, of Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Board s.r.o. and Progroup Board sp. z o.o.; and (e) security interests over certain installations, machines and other business equipment of Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Board s.r.o., and Progroup Board sp. z o.o. and Progroup Board Ltd. The Additional Notes are intended to benefit from the same liens over the Collateral as the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Facilities. In order to address any potential legal uncertainty in certain jurisdictions on this point with regard to certain liens, however, we will enter into separate confirmation agreements and/or amendment agreements with regard to such liens on or before the issue date of the Additional Notes. In addition, we will create supplemental and/or additional junior ranking liens over certain assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors that form part of the Collateral in certain jurisdictions. Such additional liens will secure all the Notes. In certain jurisdictions, such supplemental and/or additional liens over the Collateral, because they are being granted at a later point in time, will rank junior to security interests in the Collateral granted in favor of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Facilities. However, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the benefit of the first and junior ranking pledges over the Collateral shall be shared equally among the Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Lenders, the Senior Secured Facility Lenders, the creditors of the Priority Hedging Obligations and the creditors of the Cash Management Liabilities, provided that any liabilities in 211 ----- respect of obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities that are secured by assets that also secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Guarantors’ obligations under Note Guarantees will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets. In determining whether and what additional collateral and guarantees may be provided the Agreed Security Principles as set forth in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be taken into account. According to such principles, guarantees shall not be granted and collateral shall not be created, perfected or registered in particular to the extent that it would be likely to: - result in any breach of general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, financial assistance or thin-capitalisation rules or other similar laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; - result in any risk that the directors and officers of the relevant grantor of collateral or guarantees could be held to be (i) in breach of their fiduciary duties and/or (ii) company or criminal law; - result in costs that are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that collateral and including, but not limited to, the materiality of the proposed collateral in light of the aggregate collateral already granted; or - result in an undue administrative burden on, or material inconvenience to the ordinary course of operations of the provider of the collateral and the guarantee or prejudice any commercial relationships of such parties. Furthermore, any assets (other than shares) subject to pre-existing third-party arrangements which are permitted by the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and which prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant Security Document. Also, no guarantee or security shall be required from any member of the Group that is a joint venture (where that joint venture is entered into between a member of the Group and an independent third party joint venture partner) or from any entity in which a member of the Group holds a minority interest and no security will be required over the shares held by any member of the Group in a joint venture (where that joint venture is entered into between a member of the Group and an independent third party joint venture partner). The share pledges, the interest pledges and the account pledges indicated above will be established pursuant to the Security Documents with the Security Agent acting for the benefit of the Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Lenders and the Senior Secured Facility Lenders. The other Collateral will be established pursuant to the Security Documents with the Security Agent acting for the benefit of the Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Lenders and the Senior Secured Facility Lenders being the legal holder of the security interests in the Collateral. Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions which, in the case of some Collateral, will not be completed until after the issue date of the Additional Notes (including security interests over certain real property which perfection requirements will be satisfied only until after the issue date of the Additional Notes). Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, if machinery, other equipment or real property are acquired by the Issuer or any Guarantor that is not automatically subject to a perfected security interest under the Security Documents and which will be subject to a security interest in favor of the holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Lenders or the Senior Secured Facility Lenders, then (to the extent the security interest is not already granted in favor of the Security Agent for the Holders) the Issuer or such Guarantor will within three months, with respect to acquired machinery or other equipment, and within six months, with respect to acquired real property, provide security over such assets in favor of the Security Agent. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, no security shall be granted in favor of the Security Agent or the Holders over any such assets which are subject to any Liens granted or created in accordance with clauses (13)(b), (15), (23), (29), (30) or (31) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’.

(ii) the Security Agent shall only be required to release the Liens on a portion of the real property as reasonably required (as determined in good faith by the Issuer’s Board of Directors) for the realization of the relevant Packaging Park Project; and (iii) any division of real property, if applicable, shall not materially impair the value of the portion of the remaining real property (as determined in good faith by the Issuer’s Board of Directors);

Generally, under Polish law, the pledge or mortgage is strictly accessory and follows the debt or claim it secures and may not be transferred without such debt or claim. If such debt or claim is transferred without the pledge or mortgage, the latter will expire. For that reason, in certain transactions, also in Poland, a parallel debt structure is used, whereby the guarantor, as a separate and independent obligation governed by non-Polish law, undertakes to pay to the security agent amounts equal to the amounts due by it to the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure, therefore, creates a separate and independent claim of the security agent that can be validly secured by a security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the security agent in its own capacity as a creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and not as a representative of the creditors. It is usually expressly agreed in such parallel debt agreement that the obligations of the debtor towards the security agent shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors are reduced (and vice versa). The Supreme Court issued the judgments on October 9, 2009 (Case No. IV CSK 145/09, Case No. IV CSK 169/09 and Case No. IV CSK 155/09) concerning the effectiveness of establishing security interests over the assets of the debtor of parallel debt. In the above cases, the Supreme Court has not challenged the validity of a foreign law parallel debt structure, however, such structure was only indirectly referred to in the above judgments. As there is no doctrine of ‘‘precedence’’ under Polish law, uncertainty exists as to validity and enforceability of the parallel debt under Polish law.

201,Offerings 2019.md,1204,UNITED KINGDOM,1204.2,Applicable insolvency proceedings: administration and liquidation,1204.2.1,,"For these purposes, the applicable insolvency regimes under English law are administration and liquidation. Administration is a flexible procedure, the primary purpose of which is the rescue of the company as a going concern (the other purposes are set out below). In contrast, liquidation will result in the winding up of the company. The English legal regime (which is principally set out in the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended (the ‘‘UK Insolvency Act’’) and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (together with the UK Insolvency Act, (the ‘‘UK Insolvency Legislation’’)) that would apply in the event of any insolvency proceedings of the English Guarantor may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions with which creditors may be more familiar. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways. The company or a creditor may apply to court for the making of an administration order in respect of the company or the company itself or certain secured creditors may appoint an administrator to the company using an out of court process. Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be placed into administration at the application of, among others, the English Guarantor itself, its directors or one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying floating charge over the assets of the English Guarantor also has the right to appoint an administrator. In addition, he has the right to intervene in an application made for administration proceedings by another person by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking the appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver. If the English Guarantor grants a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the UK Insolvency Act as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the UK Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant English company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital markets investment’’ (which is defined in the UK Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument, and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded). Liquidation proceedings can be opened by a creditor filing a petition with a court to wind up the company (a ‘‘compulsory winding up’’) or the company’s resolving to do so in a general meeting of shareholders (a ‘‘voluntary winding up’’). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, (or, in the case of an appointment by the holder of a qualifying floating charge, if the relevant charge has become enforceable) and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent either on a ‘‘cash-flow’’ or ‘‘balance-sheet’’ basis. In broad terms, a company is cash-flow insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; a company is balance-sheet insolvent if the value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (i) the rescue of the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the primary 302 ----- objective); (ii) the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) (the second objective); or (iii) the realization of some or all of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (the third objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the statutory objective of the administration process in the order set out above: unless he thinks either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole, he must try to achieve the primary objective. Moreover, the administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless he thinks that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the first objective or the second objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Liquidation is a procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the UK Insolvency Legislation. At the end of the liquidation process, the company will normally be dissolved. For the Holders of the Notes, indirectly benefiting from the Guarantee and security interests granted by the English Guarantor, the most important consequences of the opening of formal insolvency proceedings in England and Wales against the English Guarantor would be that: - the appointed insolvency practitioner (an administrator or liquidator) would have the right to administer and dispose of the assets of such English Guarantor as the representative of the insolvent estate; - in certain circumstances, an administrator or a liquidator will have powers to challenge the Guarantee and security interests granted by the English Guarantor and potentially certain intercompany obligations entered into by the English Guarantor; and - in general terms, the Holders of the Notes could only pursue their claims against the English Guarantor in accordance with the provisions in the UK Insolvency Legislation.

201,Offerings 2019.md,1204,UNITED KINGDOM,1204.3,Stay on proceedings,1204.3.1,,"Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration order (in the case of court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is made and, when an administrator is appointed, a full statutory moratorium applies. Whilst there are a few exceptions, save where the court or (in the case of a full statutory moratorium) the administrator consents, that moratorium prevents creditors taking any action against the company to recover their debts including, among other things, commencing or continuing any legal process against the company, winding up the company, enforcing security or repossessing goods in the company’s possession under a hire purchase or similar agreement. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended) (the ‘‘Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations’’). Equally, the court’s making of an order for the winding-up of an English company brings into effect a stay on the commencement or continuation of any court proceedings against it (although security enforcement is not stayed). There is no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding up. Where a liquidation is commenced by the shareholders of an English company, the liquidator will usually apply to court for a stay on the continuation of any ongoing legal proceedings. Again though, creditors’ rights to enforce their security are not affected. Subject to the above points, were the English Guarantor to enter administration, it is possible that the security granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. Similarly, whilst any principal debt or guarantee obligation owed by it would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action could be taken in respect of any failure to pay. Administrators may dispose of property that is subject to a floating charge without the consent of the relevant charge holder, which will have the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal as it had in respect of the property disposed of. With the prior approval of the court, an administrator can dispose of property subject to a fixed charge without the consent of the relevant secured creditor, provided 303 ----- that: the disposal is likely to promote the administration’s purpose; and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the secured creditor.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454
201,Offerings 2019.md,1204,UNITED KINGDOM,1204.4,Priority of claims in UK insolvency proceedings,1204.4.1,,"In the liquidation of the English Guarantor or its administration (where the relevant administrator makes a distribution), the insolvent company’s assets will be realized and distributed to its creditors. Creditors are placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in a descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been repaid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the cash is distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the company but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the value of the asset in which they have a proprietary interest. - Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency proceedings (there is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which those expenses are paid); - Third ranking claims: preferential debt, which includes (but is not limited to) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes, employment claims (wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person and holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date); - Fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets according to the priority of their security. However, before distributing such asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Fifth ranking claims: general - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and secured creditors to the extent of any unsecured shortfall (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them). To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; - secondly, statutory interest that arises on debts after the insolvency at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and a statutory rate; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and - Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company, provided that it is in the process of being wound up. It is anticipated that new legislation will, in the case of insolvencies commencing on or after April 6, 2020, confer secondary preferential creditor status on HMRC in respect of taxes collected and held by businesses on behalf of HMRC (for example, PAYE income tax and VAT). Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the subordination. The UK Insolvency Legislation broadly provides that in a liquidation of a company, where the assets available for payment of its general creditors (excluding any amount ring-fenced for unsecured debts as 304 ----- described above) are not sufficient to meet the liquidation expenses, certain specified liquidation expenses can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims. In the case of litigation expenses exceeding £5,000, this is subject to rules restricting the application of this provision to certain litigation expenses approved by the floating chargee and any preferential creditors or the court. Consequently, realizations by secured creditors upon the enforcement of floating charges securing any principal or guarantee obligation to the Holders could potentially be reduced by the amount of any liquidation expenses. If any fixed security is validly created, any claims of creditors holding such fixed security would rank ahead of any such liquidation expenses. The creditors holding the security would, however, pay the expenses of realizing their security directly to the liquidator or other person (such as a receiver or security trustee) who disposed of the secured assets on their behalf. Broadly speaking, expenses that qualify as expenses of the administration (and which include, among others, expenses properly incurred by the administrator in performing his functions in the administration and necessary disbursements incurred in the course of the administration) enjoy priority status, in a similar way to liquidation expenses (as described above) although the categories of expenses are slightly different. In particular, expenses of the administration can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available to satisfy any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors.

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the English Guarantor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the holder of the security in practice. Where the English Guarantor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the English Guarantor in respect of that part of the English Guarantor’s net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing under ‘‘Prescribed Part’’ above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the English Guarantor may have priority over the rights of the Security Agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security.

A company will be ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ if it is proved to the court’s satisfaction that the company is not able to pay its debts as they fall due or that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, a statutory demand for over £750 is served on the company and remains unsatisfied for three weeks or the company has failed to secure or compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the relevant creditor within such period, or if any execution against or other court process issued in respect of a court judgment debt in favor of a creditor is returned unsatisfied in whole or in part. If the Guarantee or any security interest granted by the English Guarantor is challenged under the laws of England and Wales, and the court makes certain findings (as described further below), the court may: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of the English Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantee or security interests provided by it; - direct that the Holders of the Notes return any amounts paid to them by the English Guarantor under the Guarantee, either directly to the English Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the English Guarantor’s creditors generally; and/or - take other action that may be detrimental to the Holders of the Notes.

The grant of a guarantee or provision of Collateral will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the company either receives no consideration in return for the guarantee or provision of Collateral, or receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by it. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee must be granted or the Collateral must be provided within a period of two years ending with the onset of the company’s insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act). The onset of insolvency is the date on which the first of the following occurs: an administrator is appointed, an application for an administration order is made to court, notice of intention to appoint an administrator through an out of court process is filed at court, a winding up petition is presented at court or a shareholders’ resolution to wind up is passed. In addition the company must either be ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when it grants the guarantee or provides the Collateral or become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as a result. Even if these tests are satisfied, a court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, it will make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the relevant guarantee or setting it or the provision of Collateral aside). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction is a ‘‘connected person’’ of the English company (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), in which case there is a presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was in fact solvent.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

The grant of a guarantee or security interest will be a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the guarantee or security interest had not been granted. The company must either have been unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or become so unable as a result of the transaction. A challenge can only be made if the guarantee or security interest was granted within the period of (i) six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act—see above) if the beneficiary of the guarantee or security interest is not a connected person or (ii) if the beneficiary is a connected person of the English company, two years ending with the onset of insolvency. A court should not make an order that a preference has been granted unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to enter into the relevant transaction by a desire to put the relevant creditor in a better position in the event of the company’s liquidation. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position. Moreover, a company can only grant a preference to an existing creditor. If the Holders of the Notes only become creditors of the English Guarantor at the same time as they subscribe for the Notes and become creditors of the Issuer and it is a condition of their subscribing for the Notes that such guarantees or security interest are granted, it is very unlikely that any question of preference should arise. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a preference, it will make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting them or any security interests aside). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was in fact no such influence.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it satisfies the criteria for being a transaction at an undervalue (see above) and the court is satisfied that the substantial purpose of the company in entering into the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against the company or to prejudice the interests of such persons in relation to their actual or potential claim. If the court determines the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, it may make such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into or protect the interests of the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting it or the Collateral aside).

Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantor becomes unable to pay its debts within a period of up to two years of the issuance of the Notes, any floating charge created during the relevant time period will be automatically invalid, except to the value of the Consideration. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) will not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law.

Subject to certain exceptions and the limitation discussed in the following paragraph, a U.S. holder may elect to amortize this premium, as an offset to stated interest over the remaining term of an Additional Note, using a constant yield method, over the remaining term of the Additional Note. A U.S. holder making this election must generally use any amortizable bond premium allocable to an accrual period to offset stated interest required to be included in income with respect to the Additional Note in such accrual period. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the deduction for amortizable bond premium. A U.S. holder who elects to amortize bond premium must reduce his tax basis in the Additional Note by the amount of the premium amortized in any year. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations then owned and thereafter acquired by the holder and may be revoked only with the consent of the IRS.

The Additional Notes are subject to call provisions at our option at various times. As a result, a U.S. holder will calculate the amount of amortizable bond premium based on the amount payable on an applicable call date if the use of the call price and the call date results in a smaller amortizable bond premium for the period ending on the call date. In the event that we do not exercise our call rights on such call date, the Additional Note generally should be treated as reissued on the call date for the call price, and the U.S. holder will recalculate the amount of any amortizable bond premium on such Additional Note pursuant to the principles described above.

Investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications relating to the Notes through Clearstream Banking on days when the Clearstream Banking system is open for business. That system may not be open for business on certain days when banks, brokers and other institutions are open for business in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications in connection with completing transactions through Clearstream Banking on the same business day as in the United States.

201,Offerings 2019.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,,23.1.1,,"The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany. Other Guarantors are incorporated in Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. None of the directors, officers or other executives of the Issuer and the Guarantors are residents or citizens of the United States. Therefore, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors, officers or executives. Furthermore, since the assets of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their respective directors and officers are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. Federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States. We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including the following: - the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law; - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law; - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served complaint; - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court; - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the matter (Verfahren) pending before a German court, provided that such German matter was pending before a German court prior to the U.S. court entered its judgment; - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial foundations of German law, in particular with the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law. We have been advised by French, Czech, Polish and English counsel that similar risks related to enforcing judgments from a U.S. federal or state court exist in such jurisdictions, and we cannot assure you that such risks do not and will not exist in other jurisdictions, including those in which the assets of some or all of our subsidiaries that may guarantee the Notes in the future are located. 331 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

This amount mainly includes pension provisions which were measured in accordance with the PUC method using Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck’s 2018 G mortality tables. The first-time application of the new 2018 G mortality tables results in a difference in the required amount of pension provisions of KEUR 12.3. The provisions were discounted at the market interest rate of the preceding ten years published by Deutsche Bundesbank (10-year average interest rate) assuming that all liabilities have a remaining maturity of 15 years (section 253(2) sent. 2 of the HGB). Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions: - Pension increase: +0% (previous year: 2%) - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2017) - Interest rate (10-year average): 3.21% - Interest rate (7-year average): 2.32% Pension obligations for which provisions were required to be recognised amounted to KEUR 1,386 as at the balance sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve exclusively to settle liabilities from post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment by third parties (so-called plan assets). A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan asset. Plan assets that serve a specific purpose, have been pledged and are protected against insolvency were measured based on information from the insurer as at December 31, 2018, at the asset value (KEUR 1,209; this corresponds to the fair value). The balance remaining after the offset with the carrying amount of the pension provision (KEUR 176) is reported under ‘‘provisions for pensions’’. Effect on profit in 2018: - Interest expense from pension provision: KEUR 44 - Interest income from plan assets: KEUR 25 The balance of interest expenses from the measurement of the pension provision (including the effect from changes in interest) and interest income from the measurement of the plan assets was reported net in the financial result. For the financial year, the balance between the measurement of the pension provision with the 7-year average interest rate and the 10-year average interest rate amounts to KEUR 180 and is subject to a distribution restriction at the level of the individual financial statements of Progroup AG.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. F-41 ----- - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

In accordance with the Directive on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property and amending directives and regulations (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Wohnimmobilienkreditrichtlinie und zur Anderung handelsrechtlicher Vorschriften) dated March 17,[¨] 2016, all pension provisions were discounted at the market interest rate of the preceding ten years published by Deutsche Bundesbank (10-year average interest rate) assuming that all liabilities have a remaining maturity of 15 years (§ 253 para. 2 sent. 2 HGB). In the previous year the average market rate of the last seven years was used for discounting. Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions: - Pension increase: +2% (unchanged from 2015) - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2015) - Interest rate (10-year average): 4.03% - Interest rate (7-year average): 3.28% Pension obligations for which provisions were required to be recognized amounted to KEUR 1,065 as at the balance sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve exclusively to settle liabilities from post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment by third parties (so-called plan assets). A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan asset. Plan assets that serve a specific purpose, have been pledged and are protected against insolvency were measured based on information from the insurer as at December 31, 2016, at the asset value (KEUR 1,030; this corresponds to the fair value). The balance remaining amount after the offset with the carrying amount of the pension provision (KEUR 35) is reported under ‘‘provisions for pensions’’. Effect on profit in 2016: - Interest expense from pension provision: KEUR 39 - Interest income from plan assets: KEUR 19 The balance of interest expenses from the measurement of the pension provision (including the effect from changes in interest) and interest income from the measurement of the plan assets was reported net in the financial result. For the financial year, the balance between the measurement of the pension provision with the 7-year average interest rate and the 10-year average interest rate amounts to KEUR 124 and is subject to a distribution restriction at the level of the individual financial statements of Progroup AG.",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

As at December 31, 2016, this revolving credit facility was not utilized by the company or its subsidiaries. In addition to the already existing PLN Loan I of PLN 107 million, of May 31, 2016, Prowell sp. z o.o. entered into a further credit facility on a fixed rate loan in an amount of PLN 107 million with Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt (PLN Loan II). Thus, as at December 31, 2016, two PLN loan agreements exist for PLN 107 million each. Of the PLN Loan II, PLN 9 million had been used as at December 31, 2016. The bonds, the PLN-loans and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility are secured pari passu as mentioned above. In an Intercreditor Agreement the creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility were granted priority satisfaction from possible proceeds of sale. Trade payables are also secured under the customary retention of title. KEUR 3,052 of other liabilities was attributable to tax liabilities (December 31, 2015: KEUR 4,079) and KEUR 665 to social security liabilities (December 31, 2015: KEUR 620). refuse-derived fuel as well as various other items had already been reported in accordance with the provisions of the BilRUG: these items of other operating income had already been reported in accordance with the provisions of the BilRUG: during the downtime. The items of exceptional size or incidence in form of additional costs mostly consist of additional maintenance costs at Propower that are reported in other operating expenses (KEUR 8,958) as well as costs for an alternative steam supply for Propapier PM2 reported in material expenses (KEUR 2,776), costs for the third-party disposal of the refuse-derived fuel (rejects) of Propapier PM1 GmbH and Propapier PM2 GmbH (KEUR 1,152) as well as increased energy costs for Propower’s own demand for power and consumption of fuel oil (KEUR 1,026). Of these additional costs, KEUR 11,736 were reported in the financial year 2016 as payments in the cash flow statement. In addition, other operating expenses include non-cash extraordinary expenses in the financial year resulting from a compensation claim against an insurer that was written off in an amount of KEUR 921. Furthermore, the item contains rental and leasing expenses of KEUR 6,396 (previous year: KEUR 5,816) as well as expenses from currency translation of KEUR 3,405 (previous year: KEUR 4,165). Due to the new regulations resulting from the German Accounting Standard Implementation Act (Bilanzrichtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz, ‘‘BilRUG’’), the item ‘‘extraordinary expenses’’ that was reported separately in the previous year was reclassified to other operating expenses. The extraordinary expenses of the previous year (KEUR 38,341) incurred in connection with the acquisition or rather the financing of the combined heat and power plant in an amount of KEUR 6,852 as well as with the expenses relating to the refinancing in an amount of KEUR 31,278, of which KEUR 4,109 were cash-effective in financial year 2016.

Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the companies included in consolidation, the determination of the companies to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the Company’s Board of Managing Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report.

Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions: - Pension increase: +2% (unchanged from 2016) - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2016) - Interest rate (10-year average): 3.68% - Interest rate (7-year average): 2.8% Pension obligations for which provisions were required to be recognized amounted to KEUR 1,290 as at the balance sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve exclusively to settle liabilities from post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment by third parties (so-called plan assets). A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan asset. Plan assets that serve a specific purpose, have been pledged and are protected against insolvency were measured based on information from the insurer as at December 31, 2017, at the asset value (KEUR 1,118; this corresponds to the fair value). The balance remaining after the offset with the carrying amount of the pension provision (KEUR 173) is reported under ‘‘provisions for pensions’’.

Other disclosures 1.** **Contingent liabilities, off-balance sheet transactions and other financial commitments",1210.43.1,,"In addition to the bonds (amount as at December 31, 2017: EUR 495 million), there still is a revolving credit facility in the amount of EUR 50 million which was granted by a syndicate of banks (Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility). As at December 31, 2017, the revolving credit facility was not utilized by the company or any of its subsidiaries. The bonds outstanding on the balance sheet date and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, which can also be utilized by subsidiaries of Progroup AG, as well as the two loans in the amount of PLN 177.6 million as at December 31, 2017 granted to Prowell sp. z o. o. by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, are secured by pledging all shares in Progroup AG and the company shares in its main subsidiaries, by pledging the bank deposits of the holding company, by assigning tangible fixed assets of the subsidiaries, by granting real estate liens and by assignments of certain receivables. Furthermore, certain covenants apply with regard to the loans and/or bonds. The bonds, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility as well as two loans granted to Prowell sp. z o. o. by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in the amount of PLN 177.6 million are secured pari passu as mentioned above. However, in an Intercreditor Agreement the creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility were granted a priority satisfaction from any proceeds from realization. Furthermore, the parent company has provided letters of comfort and guarantees for a total amount of KEUR 29,921 to various suppliers of subsidiaries. The parent company also has assumed joint and several co-liability vis-`a-vis CommerzFactoring GmbH for obligations of Prowell GmbH from a forfaiting framework agreement. The risk of enforcement should be regarded as low as none of the affiliates have a strained liquidity position. The companies lease forklifts and trucks under operating lease agreements so that these assets are not recognized in the companies’ financial statements. As at December 31, 2017, the remaining obligations from the lease agreements were KEUR 8,367. In addition, there were rental and lease agreements for movable assets as well as for the rental of factory buildings and areas as at the balance sheet date. As at December 31, 2017, the remaining obligations from these rental/lease agreements for subsequent years were KEUR 19,193 (nominal amount). The advantage of these agreements is that a lower amount of capital is tied up in the beginning than with a purchase and there is an absence of realization risk. Risks could arise from the lease agreement periods if the assets can no longer be fully utilized, although there are currently no indications of this. As at the balance sheet date, there were steam supply contracts in place for the reliable supply of energy at fixed prices which did not lead, however, to a recognition of a provision for contingent losses. These agreements have terms of up to 8 years (December 31, 2025). Due to specific contractual agreements for energy supply entered into as at the balance sheet date, total obligations for the following year 2018 amount to KEUR 9,766 (December 31, 2016: KEUR 11,908). In the previous year, there was an obligation from a consignment agreement amounting to KEUR 39. F-59 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,454

201,Offerings 2019.md,103,INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT,103.18,,103.18.1,,"To Progroup AG, Offenbach a.d. Queich _Audit Opinions_ We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, Offenbach a.d. Queich, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31. December 2017, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year from 1. January to 31. December 2017, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented therein. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Progroup AG for the financial year from 1. January to 31. December 2017. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31. December 2017 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1. January to 31. December 2017 in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, and - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Pursuant to Article 322 paragraph 3 sentence 1 Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. _Basis for the Audit Opinions_ We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the ‘‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report’’ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. _Other Information_ The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The letter to investors is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor’s report. Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or F-69 ----- - otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles. In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures. F-70 ----- - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
