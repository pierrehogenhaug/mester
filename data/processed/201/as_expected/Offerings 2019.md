-----

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each joint bookrunner, the target market
assessment in respect of the Additional Notes described in the attached preliminary offering memorandum
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Additional Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of such Additional Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Additional Notes (a
‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of such Additional Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Additional Notes described in the attached preliminary offering memorandum are not intended to be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to
any retail investor in the European Economic Area (‘‘EEA’’). For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended or superseded, the ‘‘Insurance
**Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point**
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as
amended or superseded, the ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’). Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling
the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

The preliminary offering memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that
documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic

named in the preliminary offering memorandum or any person who controls any of them or any director,
officer, employee or agent of them or affiliate of any such person accepts any liability or responsibility
whatsoever in respect of any alterations to the preliminary offering memorandum distributed to you in
electronic format.

**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**IN THE UNITED STATES**

29MAY201917283251


E150,000,000 3.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2026


Progroup AG, organized as a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) under German law (the ‘‘Issuer’’), is offering (the ‘‘Offering’’) A150,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of 3.000% senior secured notes due 2026 (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) to refinance the Issuer’s existing A150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
senior secured floating rate notes due 2024 (the ‘‘Floating Rate Notes’’). The Additional Notes will be issued with, and governed by, the conditions of issue (the
‘‘Conditions of Issue’’) governing the Issuer’s existing A450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000% senior secured notes due 2026 (the ‘‘Existing Notes’’, and
together with the Additional Notes, the ‘‘Notes’’). The Additional Notes will constitute an increase (Aufstockung) and will have the same terms as the Existing
Notes in all respects and will be consolidated with and form a single series (Gesamtemission) with the Existing Notes for all purposes, including, without
limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.

Any Additional Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S (‘‘Regulation S’’) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Securities Act’’) will share
the same international securities identification number (ISIN) and the same common code as the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S, and will be
fungible with the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S as of their issuance. Any Additional Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A (‘‘Rule 144A’’) under
the U.S. Securities Act will initially have a separate ISIN and common code from the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A, until the termination of
certain U.S. selling restrictions one year after the issue date of the Additional Notes. After the expiration of this one year period, the Additional Notes issued
pursuant to Rule 144A and the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A will share the same ISIN and common code as the Existing Notes issued pursuant to
Rule 144A, and will become fungible with the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A.

Interest on the Additional Notes will be deemed to have accrued from March 31, 2019 and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and
September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2019. The Additional Notes will mature on March 31, 2026.

The Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes on or after March 31, 2021, at the redemption prices set out in this offering memorandum. Prior to March 31,
2021, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts (as defined herein), if any, plus the Applicable Premium (as defined herein). In addition, prior to March 31, 2021, the Issuer
may also redeem at its option up to 35% of the original principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption
price equal to 103.000% plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, provided that at least 65% of the original principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding
after the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to repurchase all
of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined
herein), if any. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, we may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes.

The Additional Notes will be governed by German law and will constitute senior obligations of the Issuer. The Existing Notes and all obligations under the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Facilities (each as defined herein) are, and the Additional Notes and the New Senior Secured
Facilities (as defined herein) will be, secured by first-ranking liens over the Collateral (as defined below) (although any liabilities in respect of obligations under
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities (each as defined herein) that are secured by the
Collateral will receive priority over the Additional Notes, the Existing Notes and obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and New Senior
Secured Facilities with respect to any proceeds received upon any enforcement action over the Collateral). The Additional Notes, the Existing Notes and all
obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and the New Senior Secured Facilities will rank _pari passu among themselves and equal in right of_
payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not subordinated in right of payment to the Additional Notes, the Existing Notes and
obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and the New Senior Secured Facilities, will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Additional Notes, the Existing Notes and obligations under the Existing
Senior Secured Facilities and the New Senior Secured Facilities, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness, will rank senior
in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is subordinated in right of payment to the Additional Notes, the Existing Notes and
obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and the New Senior Secured Facilities, and will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors (as defined below).

The Existing Notes are, and the Additional Notes will be, guaranteed (the ‘‘Guarantees’’) on a senior basis by certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (the
‘‘Guarantors’’). The Guarantors also guarantee the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and the New Senior Secured
Facilities on a pari passu basis. The Existing Notes and all obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Facilities
are, and the Additional Notes and New Senior Secured Facilities will be, secured by first-ranking liens over (i) the shares of the Issuer, Progroup Board S.A.S.
and each Guarantor; (ii) certain real property; (iii) certain bank accounts of the Issuer; and (iv) certain fixed and other assets (the ‘‘Collateral’’) as described in
more detail under ‘‘Description of the Notes—General—Security; Release of Collateral’’. The Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral will be
subject to certain significant contractual and legal limitations or subject to certain defenses under applicable law. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the_
_Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability’’. The Guarantees and the security interests may be released under certain circumstances. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—There are_
_circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral and the Guarantees may be released automatically, without your consent or_
_the consent of the Holders’ Representative’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes—General—_
_Security; Release of Collateral’’._

This offering memorandum includes information on the terms of the Additional Notes and the Guarantees, including with regard to redemption and repurchase
prices, guarantees, covenants and transfer restrictions. The Additional Notes will be represented by global notes deposited with Clearstream Banking AG,
Frankfurt am Main, Germany (‘‘Clearstream Banking’’). Definitive notes representing individual Additional Notes will not be issued. Transfer of the Additional
Notes will be subject to the rules of Clearstream Banking and the terms of a book entry registration agreement (‘‘Book Entry Registration Agreement’’) among
Clearstream Banking and the Issuer with respect to the Notes. The Additional Notes will be issued in denominations of A1,000 and will be transferable only in
minimum aggregate principal amounts of A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Additional Notes will be ready for delivery, in book
entry form only, on or around, 2019.

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the ‘‘Authority’’) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Additional
Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’). There is no assurance that the Additional Notes will be listed on the Official
List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Additional Notes will be granted, or that such listing will be maintained.
**Investing in the Additional Notes involves a high degree of risk. See ‘‘Risk Factors’’ beginning on page 26.**

**The Additional Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘‘U.S. Securities Act’’) or**

the date specified on the cover page of the offering memorandum, which will be the tenth business day
following the date of pricing of the Additional Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T+10’’).
Under Rule 15(c)6 1 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‘‘Exchange Act’’),
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to
any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Additional Notes
on the date of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Additional
Notes who wish to trade the Additional Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven succeeding business
days should consult their own advisor.

**NOTICE TO EEA INVESTORS**

This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Additional Notes in any
Member State of the European Economic Area (the ‘‘EEA’’) will be made pursuant to an exemption under
the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Additional Notes.
This document is an advertisement and not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive. The
expression ‘‘Prospectus Directive’’ means Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended or superseded), and includes
any relevant implementing measure in the Member State concerned.

**Professional investors and eligible counterparties only target market**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each Joint Bookrunner, the target market
assessment in respect of the Additional Notes described in this offering memorandum has led to the
conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Additional Notes is eligible counterparties and professional
clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, ‘‘MiFID II’’); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of such Additional Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.
Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Additional Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject
to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Additional
Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS**

The Additional Notes are not intended to be offered, distributed or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended
or superseded, the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as
defined in the Prospectus Directive. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Additional Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Additional Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may
be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation.

**THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION WHICH YOU SHOULD**
**READ BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY DECISION WITH RESPECT TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE**
**ADDITIONAL NOTES.**

**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws
of certain applicable jurisdictions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, all
statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this offering memorandum, including,
without limitation, those regarding our future financial position and results of operations, our strategy,
plans, objectives, goals and targets, future developments in the markets in which we participate or are
seeking to participate or anticipated regulatory changes in the markets in which we operate or intend to
operate. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as ‘‘aim’’,
‘‘anticipate’’, ‘‘believe’’, ‘‘continue’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘estimate’’, ‘‘expect’’, ‘‘forecast’’, ‘‘guidance’’, ‘‘intend’’,
‘‘may’’, ‘‘ongoing’’, ‘‘plan’’, ‘‘potential’’, ‘‘predict’’, ‘‘projected’’, ‘‘propose’’, ‘‘seek’’, ‘‘should’’, ‘‘targets’’ or
‘‘will’’ or the negative of such terms or other variation or comparable terminology.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future.
We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based
on numerous assumptions and that our actual results of operations, including our financial condition and
liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, may differ materially from (and be
more negative than) those made in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this
offering memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, including our financial condition and
liquidity and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking
statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of
results or developments in subsequent periods. Important risks, uncertainties and other factors that could
cause these differences include, but are not limited to:

   - the level of economic growth and activity and fluctuations in the demand for our products;

  - the cyclical nature of the containerboard and corrugated board industry and industry-wide
production capacity;

   - operational disruptions at our facilities;

  - risks associated with our expansion and other investment projects, in particular our new paper
machine project;

  - pricing pressure, consolidation of our customers, product substitution and competition in the
markets in which we operate;

  - fluctuations in the costs of our raw materials and other input costs and our ability to pass on
increases to our customers;

   - our ability to secure a reliable supply of raw materials, including recycled paper;

   - the availability of, and increases in the costs of transportation;

   - increases in energy costs and loss of financial privileges in this respect;

  - failure to successfully continue our Continuous Improvement Program and to further improve our
operational efficiency and asset utilization and to successfully implement our business strategy;

  - adverse effects arising from costs and difficulties of acquiring and integrating complementary
businesses;

   - our ability to comply with numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations as well
as changes to such laws and regulations;

   - currency exchange rate fluctuations;

   - insufficient insurance coverage;

   - loss of key customers or key personnel;

  - risks arising from uncertainties regarding the European Monetary Union;

  - IT and communication system failure or data loss;

   - tax risks attributable to previous tax assessment periods and risks associated with restrictions on the
deduction of interest expense or forfeiture of interest carry forwards under German tax laws;

v


-----

   - our substantial leverage and debt service obligations;

   - limited operating flexibility due to financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements;

   - risks of a default under our debt agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment;

   - risks associated with our capital structure, the Notes, the Guarantees and our other indebtedness;

  - force majeure and other unforeseeable events; and

   - other factors discussed in ‘‘Risk Factors’’.

The risks described in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section of this offering memorandum are not exhaustive. Other
sections of this offering memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive industry. New
risks may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess
the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors,
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

We urge you to read carefully the sections of this offering memorandum entitled ‘‘Risk Factors’’,
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’, ‘‘Industry and
_Competition’’ and ‘‘Business’’ for a more complete discussion of the factors that could affect our future_
performance and the markets in which we operate. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
the forward-looking statements described in this offering memorandum may not be accurate or occur at
all.

Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date on which the statements were made (and in any case no later than the date
of this offering memorandum). In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives, acting in
respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in
writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press releases
(including on our website), reports to our security holders and other communications. Although we believe
that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no
assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statements or risk
factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All
subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our
behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and
contained elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**General**

In this offering memorandum, the term ‘‘financial statements’’ refers to the audited consolidated financial
statements and the notes thereto of the Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements and notes thereto of the Issuer and its subsidiaries as of and for the three-month period ended
March 31, 2019 (‘‘2019 Unaudited Three Months Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements’’). The
consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018,
along with the audit reports of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr¨ufungsgesellschaft (formerly
PricewaterhouseCoopers Aktiengesellschaft Wirtschaftspr¨ufungsgesellschaft) with respect to the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018
are included in this offering memorandum beginning on page F-12. Furthermore, we have included in this
offering memorandum the 2019 Unaudited Three Months Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
which include comparative figures for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.

In addition, this offering memorandum includes certain unaudited consolidated financial information for
the 12 months ended March 31, 2019. This information was derived by adding our consolidated financial
information for the year ended December 31, 2018 derived from our audited consolidated financial
statements to our unaudited consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31,
2019 and subtracting our unaudited consolidated financial information for the three months ended
March 31, 2018.

Our financial statements included in this offering memorandum have been prepared in accordance with
German GAAP, which differs in certain significant respects from IFRS. For a discussion of significant
differences between German GAAP and IFRS, see ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Significant Differences between German GAAP and_
_IFRS’’._

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of the Offering
to which this offering memorandum relates and of the financial statements and financial information
contained in this offering memorandum. We do not present separate financial statements of the
Guarantors in this offering memorandum, because all such entities are wholly-owned, directly or indirectly,
by the Issuer, and the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of such entities are therefore
consolidated within our financial statements contained herein.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with the
reporting requirements of the SEC.

Certain numerical figures set out in this offering memorandum, including financial data and operational
volumes presented in million or thousand and percentages describing market shares, have been subject to
rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data in this offering memorandum may vary slightly
from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. The financial information and financial statements
included in this offering memorandum are presented in euro. Amounts presented in euro per ton are not
part of the financial statements but are taken from the management reporting of the Group.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain non-GAAP measures and ratios, including total output,
gross profit, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, consolidated net income/(net loss) before income tax, trade
working capital, free cash flow, net cash flow, cash flow available for debt service, adjusted cash flow
available for debt service, cash flow from change in trade working capital and cash flow from change in
total working capital, capital expenditures, total financial debt as well as net financial debt and other pro
_forma data that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, German GAAP. Our management_
believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is helpful to investors because these and other
similar measures are widely used by certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties as
supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. However, you should not construe these non-GAAP
measures as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with German GAAP or to cash flows
from operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. In addition, the non-GAAP measures
and ratios, including total output, gross profit, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, consolidated net income/(net
loss) before income tax, trade working capital, free cash flow, net cash flow, cash flow available for debt
service, adjusted cash flow available for debt service, cash flow from change in trade working capital and
cash flow from change in total working capital, capital expenditures, total financial debt as well as net
financial debt and other pro forma data presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

We operate in an industry for which it is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information.
Market data and certain economic and industry data and forecasts used, and statements regarding our
position in the industry made, in this offering memorandum are based upon market research, government
and other publicly available information, reports prepared by independent industry consultants and
independent industry publications. These include information published by RISI, Inc. (‘‘RISI’’) and Vision
Hunters Ltd. Oy (‘‘Vision Hunters’’). The information in this offering memorandum that has been sourced
from third parties has been accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware and able to ascertain from
the information published by such third parties, no facts have been omitted that would render the
reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. While we believe the statements included in such thirdparty publications to be reliable, they have not been independently verified, and neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of such information
set forth in this offering memorandum. Additionally, industry publications and such reports generally state
that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that the
accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances state that they do
not assume liability for such information. See also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and Our
_Business—The information available to market analysts varies in its degree of comparability’’. Some industry_
publications publish or provide projections or other forward looking statements that, by their very nature,
involve inherent risks and uncertainties and past projections or forward looking statements have turned
out to be inaccurate. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers can
therefore assure you of the accuracy and completeness of such information as we have not independently
verified such information.

In addition, certain information in this offering memorandum regarding our industry and our market
position is not based on published statistical data or information obtained from independent third parties.
Such information and statements reflect our estimates based upon information obtained from trade and
business organizations and associations and other contacts within the industry in which we compete,
internal surveys and assumptions we deem reasonable, as well as information published by our
competitors. To the extent that information in this offering memorandum is identified as being our belief,
that information is based on the following: (i) in respect of industry trends, our senior management’s
general business experience, as well as their experience in our industry and the markets in which we
operate, and (ii) in respect of the performance of our operations, our internal analysis of our audited and
unaudited financial and other information. As some of the foregoing information was compiled or
provided by our management and is not publicly available, such information accordingly may not be
considered to be as independent as that provided by other third-party sources.

**CURRENCY PRESENTATION AND EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

In this offering memorandum, all references to ‘‘euro’’, ‘‘EUR’’ or ‘‘E’’ are to the single currency of the
participating member states of the European and Monetary Union of the Treaty Establishing the
European Community, as amended from time to time, and all references to ‘‘U.S. dollars’’ and ‘‘US$’’ are
to the lawful currency of the United States of America. All references to ‘‘British pounds’’, ‘‘GBP’’ or ‘‘£’’
are to the lawful currency of the United Kingdom, all references to ‘‘CZK’’ or ‘‘Czech koruna’’ are to the
lawful currency of the Czech Republic and all references to ‘‘PLN’’ or ‘‘Polish zloty’’ are to the lawful
currency of the Republic of Poland.

The following table sets forth, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period end
Bloomberg Composite Rate expressed as U.S. dollars per A1.00. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a ‘‘best
market’’ calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the highest bid rate of all
contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered by these banks. The
Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate and the lowest ask
rate. The rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of our financial statements and
other financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation that the euro amounts referred to in this offering memorandum have
been, could have been or could, in the future, be converted into U.S. dollars at any particular rate, if at all.

The average rate for a year means the average of the Bloomberg Composite Rates on the last day of each
month during a year. The average rate for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of the
daily Bloomberg Composite Rates during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be.

The Bloomberg Composite Rate of the euro on June 7, 2019 was US$1.1334 per A1.00.

**OUR COMPANY**

We are a leading, family-owned producer and supplier of containerboard and corrugated board in Central
Europe and are headquartered in Landau, Germany. According to Vision Hunters, we are the third largest
producer of corrugated board in Europe (by production capacity) through our corrugated board business
(‘‘Board’’) and the sixth largest producer of recycled containerboard in Europe (by production capacity)
through our containerboard business (‘‘Paper’’). We focus on the highly efficient production and
processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of corrugated board sheets for our
mostly family-owned box manufacturing customers. In this core market segment, we are the market leader
by volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, according to
Vision Hunters. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated
paper and packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that
bring added-value to our customers in the packaging industry, _i.e. the automated and integrated_
production of containerboard and corrugated board. Our customers serve various end markets, including
industrial/manufacturing, consumer durables, processed foods, non-food manufactured consumer goods
and fresh food. Unlike many fully integrated market players, we do not produce boxes and therefore do
not compete with our box manufacturing customers but instead focus solely on the production of
containerboard and corrugated board.

Through our large scale and highly flexible production, built up primarily via a greenfield approach, we are
able to realize significant economies of scale. Since we commenced operations in 1992, we have carefully
selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a greenfield
strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we
operate. As a result, we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high
technological standards, resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and
relatively low requirements for additional capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the
high technological standards of our production facilities, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from
major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for light-weight packaging, (ii) the
increasing importance of small-size packaging due to the growing importance of e-commerce, and (iii) the
general trend towards a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and energy, which can help
reduce costs, CO2 emissions and fresh water consumption.

Our core business comprises Paper and Board. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible
containerboard production using almost exclusively recycled paper, with high output volumes to increase
cost efficiency and short delivery times. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and the first three months of 2019,
containerboard produced by Paper accounted for most of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our
corrugated board production within Board. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and the
ability of Board to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly
flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. In addition, our customers benefit from our
integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking
options.

Paper manufactures containerboard at our two paper mills in Germany, with an envisaged total annual
production capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons of containerboard. Our two existing paper machines,
PM1 in Burg and PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, have complementary production layouts which allow us to
produce brown containerboard with grammages between 60-230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recycled
paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the
appropriate widths for Board’s ten existing corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic,
France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a total annual production capacity of
approximately 1,440,000 tons of corrugated board, including our latest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’
(PW12) at Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom. Our historic greenfield location strategy ensures close
customer proximity and high production flexibility. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we
further acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH, the combined heat and power plant (the ‘‘CHP’’) adjacent to
our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and certain related assets (the ‘‘CHP Acquisition’’). As a result thereof,
we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine
PM2 ourselves (‘‘Power’’).

In 2018, we sold approximately 1,151,000 tons of corrugated board and approximately 176,000 tons of
containerboard to external customers across Europe, resulting in external corrugated board and
containerboard sales, respectively, of A840.0 million (86.9% of total sales) and A84.5 million (8.7% of total
sales). Paper’s total sales in 2018 include A17.9 million (1.9% of total sales) in revenues from the sale of
electricity and revenues from the incineration of refuse-derived fuel resulting from the integration of the
CHP as well as A9.7 million (1.0% of total sales) in sales from passing purchased fuel costs to Sales and
Solutions GmbH. Total external sales by Board and Paper in 2018 (including sales other than corrugated
board or containerboard sales, respectively) amounted to A840.8 million (87.0% of total sales) and
A112.9 million (11.7% of total sales). Our total sales and EBITDA in 2018 amounted to A966.1 million and
A275.5 million, respectively. Sales in Germany (origin), our core market, accounted for 55.8% of total sales
and 42.0% of sales by volume in 2018.

Primarily to support our core business, Paper and Board, we have established our own logistics operations,
including a fleet of currently 59 trucks (‘‘Logistics’’). Most of the remaining A12.4 million in sales (1.3% of
total sales) in 2018 were generated by Logistics.

Founded in 1991, we are indirectly majority-owned by J¨urgen Heindl, our founder and chief executive
officer.

**OUR STRENGTHS**

We believe we benefit from the following competitive strengths.

**Differentiated business model with leading market positions in attractive market environment**

Our founder, J¨urgen Heindl, designed a business model differentiating us from our competitors. Through
our strategic value chain positioning in containerboard and corrugated board production only, we do not
compete with our targeted customers, who are primarily family-owned, small and medium-sized
businesses. Our core customers focus on packaging solutions for the end-customer and typically do not
have their own corrugated board production capability. Many of our competitors are fully integrated and
focus on serving larger end-customers in large batch sizes, including global consumer corporates. Our
differentiated business model allows us to serve a higher number of customers, process a higher number of
orders and maintain higher production volumes per production site (up to 370 million square meters of
corrugated board per annum), thereby generating economies of scale. We are solely focused on the
production process as opposed to many of our competitors, who also focus on more complex and
customer-specific packaging requirements for a smaller number of larger customers and, hence, only have
an average production output of typically 70-80 million square meters per production site per annum.

In 27 years since our foundation, we have achieved leading market positions in the countries in which we
operate. We are among the top three corrugated board producers in Europe (by production capacity) and
our market share in our specific segment, the corrugated sheet market in Europe, was approximately 15%
according to a March 2018 market study by Vision Hunters. In our core market segment, namely
corrugated board sheets, we were the market leader by volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the
Czech Republic and the Netherlands, according to Vision Hunters, and we hold considerably higher
market shares in those markets compared to our position in the overall European containerboard and
corrugated board market. Following the fast and successful ramp-up of our corrugated board production
site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we have also become a very significant player in the Polish market, and
we have further become a significant player in the UK market, as a result of the commencement of
production in January 2019 and ongoing ramp-up at our newest corrugated board production site (PW12)
in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, which replaced the much smaller and now decommissioned
production site PW8. In addition, the commencement of production at our corrugated board production
site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, with an annual corrugated board production capacity
of approximately 100,000 tons, marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe.
In containerboard production, we had a market share of approximately 4% by production capacity in
Europe, according to the March 2018 market study by Vision Hunters.

While we believe our differentiated business model, high reliability and quality of product supply,
significant scale, internal sourcing and geographic coverage provide us with a competitive advantage in our
core market segment, we also benefit from attractive market fundamentals of the overall industry.

The paper and packaging industry is experiencing overall growing demand from industrial economies in
Central Europe, and we believe that Germany and Central Europe, our key markets, generally provide a
positive economic outlook. From a product perspective, the increasing significance of light-weight paper
and packaging solutions as well as small-size packaging and the increasingly online and mail order-driven
retail sector is expected to further stimulate packaging growth. We believe our modern production
facilities, particularly PM2, which is capable of producing light-weight paper grades economically on a
commercial scale, position us well to benefit from these growth trends in the industry. Furthermore,
production is driven by the strong increase in demand from emerging economies, where production and
packaging standards are adapting to the standards of developed countries, from which we also benefit with
our production in Poland and the Czech Republic

**Uniquely designed, best-in-class and strategically located, low-cost production asset base built up via**
**greenfield strategy**

Since our foundation in 1991, we have carefully designed and selected our production operations and
locations via a dedicated greenfield strategy to establish highly efficient, flexible and technologically
advanced production facilities, which were ahead of the existing market standard at the time. We believe
we are the fastest organically growing corrugated board producer in Europe and have developed a unique
track record and expertise in successfully establishing new greenfield corrugated board production sites.
This includes a dedicated and experienced in-house projects team tasked with identifying attractive market
opportunities for profitable growth, completing the planning and construction phases of the relevant

3


-----

projects on time and on budget and managing fast and successful ramp-ups of production at the relevant
sites.

Designing our production set-up primarily via a greenfield strategy allowed us to invest in the best
available production specifications and optimize the alignment and compatibility of our paper machines,
PM1 and PM2, with our corrugators. The current 2.5m, 2.8m and 3.3m trim widths of our various existing
corrugated board plants can be very efficiently combined with the 5.8m trim width of PM1 (2 � 2.8m or
2.5m + 3.3m), the 10.2m trim width of PM2 (4 � 2.5m or 3 � 3.3m) and the 9.2m trim width of our
proposed new paper machine PM3 (2 � 3.3m + 2.5m or 2 � 2.8m + 3.3m), resulting in low volumes of
cutting scrap and higher productivity.

Our corrugated board production sites have been purposefully located approximately 500 kilometers from
each other. This footprint ensures close customer proximity with full regional coverage of our customers
and limited overlap to limit the transportation distance in most circumstances to 250-300 kilometers. Our
strategic footprint also allows us to achieve high production flexibility and reliable just-in-time delivery
with short lead times. Furthermore, we are able to serve our customers from different locations, thereby
optimizing transportation costs and capacity utilizations on a plant-by-plant basis, which is coordinated
centrally from our headquarters in Landau following a ‘‘one mill approach’’. We believe our location layout
and organization give us a competitive advantage in terms of cost efficiency and customer orientation. On
average, we serve approximately 50-80 customers per corrugated board production site and each of our
production sites offers the entire range of customer services (e.g., 24 hour delivery and online ordering and
tracking).

We believe that all of our plants are equipped with state-of-the-art technology, which is the foundation of
our low-cost and efficient production. According to Vision Hunters, the asset quality of our paper
machines is characterized as high and above comparable European containerboard and corrugated board
producers. Performance metrics of PM1, such as capacity and technical age, are well above the industry
average. PM2, which we believe to be among the world’s most advanced paper machines for recycled
super-light-weight paper and which specializes in the production of super-light-weight to medium-weight
containerboard with grammages of 60-130g/m[2], ranks best in class for all metrics and has set five new world
records since its launch in 2010.

Unlike many of our competitors, who grew historically over many decades or had to integrate production
infrastructures inorganically through acquisitions, we differentiate ourselves through our well-invested
asset base and high-quality, complementary, modern and strictly aligned, high capacity production facilities
placed purposefully in strategic locations.

**Strong, diversified and long-standing customer base**

We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, some of which date back to the start of
our operations in 1992. We have grown with our large German customers as they have expanded across
Europe and have successfully entered into new relationships with key customers outside of Germany. We
currently supply 350 to 400 different Board customers, with a strategic focus on family-owned, small and
medium-sized companies. Our top five Board customers accounted for approximately 7%, 4%, 3%, 3%
and 2%, respectively, of our total corrugated board sales, by tons, in 2018, while our top five external Paper
customers accounted for approximately 28%, 12%, 11%, 8% and 5%, respectively, of our total external
containerboard sales, by tons, in 2018.

We believe that our ability to provide reliable delivery of high-quality, cost-effective and tailor-made
products and being a family-owned business have enabled us to foster strong partnerships of mutual
dependence with our mostly family-owned customers, operating as a fundamental part of their supply
chains by improving inventory management, security of supply and customer service.

Our strong customer relationships are reinforced through a combination of our geographic reach, our
manufacturing and logistics excellence, and the limited availability of alternative suppliers with the capacity
and geographic proximity to provide a competitive offering. At some of our corrugated board production
sites, certain long-standing customers have established their own box manufacturing plants in immediate
proximity to our site, either on our own land or on land adjacent to our site (so-called ‘‘Packaging Park I
**Model’’). As a variation of this original packaging park model, we commenced production in October 2015**
at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which we established in immediate
proximity to an existing packaging plant of our customer, Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk, on land owned
by our customer. As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced production in the

4


-----

first quarter of 2017 at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we
purchased from our large customer Janmar Centrum adjacent to its existing packaging plant. We refer to
these variations were we establish our own corrugated board production sites close to our customers as the
‘‘Packaging Park II Model’’. Following the success of these two packaging park projects (PW9 and PW10),
we also established our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy as a packaging park
project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of our new customer, Italian packaging
specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l.

30MAY201908580748

All versions of the packaging park model help us to further strengthen our relationships with key
customers (or win significant new customers, as in the case of Imbal Carton S.r.l.) and benefit both us and
the relevant customers. The high level of integration between our own corrugated board production and
the box production of our customers also made possible through the packaging park model creates a
number of efficiencies and largely eliminates freight and other logistics costs between Board and our
packaging park customers. Our packaging park customers also typically purchase a very high percentage
(up to 100%) of their corrugated board requirements for the relevant box plant from us, which means
predictable, high volume orders and consistently high utilization levels for the relevant corrugated board
production sites. Index pricing arrangements with our packaging park customers ensure a predictable
pricing mechanism for all parties. It typically takes approximately two to three months for containerboard
mills to pass on their raw material price increases to their customers, _i.e. manufacturers of corrugated_
board. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover
containerboard cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for corrugated board
manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases on to their customers.

**Technology and innovation leader**

There are general industry trends towards lighter and more functional packaging and towards a more
efficient use of resources. The trend towards ‘‘light paper’’ (i.e., containerboard) has been particularly
strong in Germany and has been further strengthened by the increasingly online and mail order-driven
retail sector, which is expected to further stimulate demand growth for light packaging solutions. We
believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in
Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany, which specializes in the production of super-light-weight to medium-weight
containerboard with grammages of 60-130g/m[2]. As demand for super-light-weight containerboard (with a
grammage below 90g/m[2]) is increasing, we believe that PM2 gives us a significant advantage over many of
our competitors, both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Our proposed further paper machine
PM3, on the other hand, is designed to provide standard containerboard grades with grammages of
90-130g/m[2]. Once this newest paper machine will commence operation, we believe it will give us the ability
to put an even stronger focus on the production of super-light-weight containerboard (i.e. 70 - 80g) at PM2
and to focus production at PM1 on specialty containerboard such as kraftliner substitutes and
containerboard with a higher grammages above 130g/m[2]. We believe the expected further specialization of
our paper machines will further enhance the productivity of all our paper machines as each paper mill will
be able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. For more detail on our proposed new paper machine

(PM3), see also ‘‘—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated
_board producer in Europe through controlled investments’’ below._

In addition, we continuously work to improve our product designs, optimize the utilization of our assets
and explore new ways to further reduce our input costs and secure the long-term sustainability of our core
businesses, both from an economic and environmental perspective. In particular, we are focused on further
reducing the use of fibre (i.e., recycled paper) in our products as well as the amount of energy required for
our production processes and the shipment of our products, in order to both maintain a competitive cost
position in our industry and to reduce emissions and waste.

We believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001, our paper machine PM1 was the world’s technologically
most advanced containerboard paper machine setting new technology standards, including with the use of
a closed water cycle, thereby minimizing the creation of waste water. Launched in 2010, we believe that
PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machines, which we believe has allowed us to set new
industry standards with respect to raw material efficiency. As described in more detail under ‘‘—Our
_Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe_
_through controlled investments’’ below, we further decided to make certain significant additional_
investments in connection with the proposed establishment of our newest paper machine (PM3), which we
expect will result in significant cost savings in the mid- to long-term as well as significant reductions of CO2
emissions, waste water and natural gas consumption. These investments include a state-of-the-art waste
overall waste-heat concept as well as a ‘‘first-of-its-kind’’ closed cycle waste water treatment system.

We have invested significantly in the development of a ‘‘green’’ range of ‘‘next generation’’ products
working in close cooperation with BHS Corrugated GmbH, one of our equipment suppliers, and a team of
researchers at the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f¨ur angewandte Wissenschaften) in
Regensburg, Germany. We market these products under our own brands next fibre�, next board� and next
box�. All of these product innovations involve the use of super-light-weight containerboard produced by
our paper machine PM2 as well as innovative flute designs of our corrugated board formats, intended to
further reduce raw material input and thereby further reduce weight, input costs and CO2 emissions.

**Significant synergies through high degree of vertical integration**

In 2018, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for approximately 75% of the containerboard, by
volume, used by our corrugated board production within Board. As a result of the steady expansion of our
corrugated board production capacity in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have
increased from approximately 62% (or 67%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total
containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to approximately 82% (or 93%, if we include
containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2018. With the
fast and successful ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica,
Poland during 2017 and early 2018, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals
and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of
integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board
production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the
new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further
improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further
increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of
containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our
corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper.
As we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in
Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter
of 2020) and plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe
between 2020 and 2023 (including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to
commence production in late 2020 or early 2021), we expect to successively increase this net short position
with regard to containerboard even further at least in the short-term. We therefore currently do not expect
the volume of our external containerboard sales to significantly increase again unless and until we
complete our proposed further paper machine project (PM3) in the second half of 2020. For more details
on our expansion projects and investment program, see also ‘‘—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our
_position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled investments’’ below._
With an envisaged total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons, Paper produced
approximately 1,020,000 tons and 1,035,000 tons of containerboard in 2018 and 2016, respectively. In 2018,
approximately 811,000 tons were sold internally to Board (2016: 738,000 tons of internal containerboard

6


-----

sales), and a further approximately 111,500 tons were sold pursuant to swap agreements with other
containerboard producers (2016: 106,000 tons of sales to swap partners), which allow us to reduce
transportation costs, optimize our production program and swap internally produced containerboard for
certain containerboard grades we do not produce in sufficient quantities, such as kraftliner. The remaining
approximately 64,000 tons of containerboard we sold in 2018 were sold externally (2016: approximately
198,000 tons of external containerboard sales, excluding sales to swap partners). With a total annual
corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,440,000 tons (including (i) 100,000 tons of
capacity of our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, which commenced
production in early March 2018 and (ii) more than 200,000 tons of capacity of our newest corrugated board
‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, which commenced production in January 2019)
as of the date of this offering memorandum (2016: total annual corrugated board production capacity of
approximately 1,130,000 tons), Board produced approximately 1,151,000 tons of containerboard in 2018,
compared to approximately 930,000 tons of corrugated board in 2016. We believe that a high degree of
vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality
containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business.
At the same time, we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or
improve our overall Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared
to corrugated board margins) of certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our
integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking
options. The steady increase in the degree of vertical integration between Paper and Board over the last
few years has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply chain. See also
‘‘—Our Strategy—Achieving further cost-savings and efficiency improvements through further increased external
_containerboard purchases’’ below._

**Strong track record of profitable growth**

Since 2015, we successfully completed a number of recent expansion and other investment projects,
including the CHP Acquisition as well as the successful establishment of four new corrugated board
production sites (PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12), with the construction of our new corrugated board
production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany progressing on schedule and earthworks for our third paper
machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany having started in January 2019. In addition, we
successfully implemented a series of initiatives in recent years as part of our Continuous Improvement
Program to improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities, optimize (i.e., minimize) our
variable costs and stabilize our specific fixed costs in order to achieve sales excellence and maintain our
position as one of the cost leaders in our industry.

As a result of these and other factors, we have managed to continue to significantly improve our
profitability and cash position and moved the Group to a structurally enhanced level of profitability in
recent years. In particular, we have managed to increase our EBITDA from A81.7 million in 2013 to
A125.1 million in 2014, A152.9 million in 2015, A154.7 million in 2016, A180.4 million in 2017 and
A275.5 million in 2018. During the same period, our EBITDA margin (calculated by dividing EBITDA by
sales) improved from 14.0% in 2013 to an exceptional 28.5% in 2018. Combined with our controlled
investment strategy, which should normally allow us to adapt the amount of our expansion capital
expenditures in line with our projected mid-term cash requirement, we believe we are in a strong financial
condition to weather and/or adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole.

**Committed family shareholders and experienced management team for long-term stability**

Our company was founded in 1991 by J¨urgen Heindl, our chief executive officer, and continues to be
controlled by him and his two sons, Maximilian Heindl and Vinzenz Heindl. We believe this family link and
the strong personal and long-standing financial commitment of our owners ensures our focus on stability,
long-term value generation and prudent investment strategies. J¨urgen Heindl’s expertise is supported by a
strong and growing management team with extensive industry experience, including within our Group. Our
management team has impressively demonstrated its abilities by creating one of Europe’s leading
containerboard and corrugated board players in 27 years while withstanding economic downturns and
restructurings. In response to the increasing size and complexity of the Group and to free up management
capacity to allow J¨urgen Heindl to focus on the strategic development of the Group, we have successfully
professionalized and expanded our senior management team, including our Executive Board. Dr. Volker
Metz rejoined the Group as our chief financial officer in November 2016, after previously having served as
our head of controlling between 2009 and January 2016. Similarly, after spending seven years with one of

7


-----

our largest international competitors, Philipp Kosloh rejoined the Group in November 2016 and was
appointed a deputy member of our Executive Board, with a view to becoming our first chief operating
officer. Mr. Kosloh had previously served in various capacities within the Group between 2001 and 2009.
Effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Kosloh became a regular member of the Executive Board and assumed the
role of chief operating officer. In addition, after gaining several years of relevant work and management
experience in the paper industry outside the Group, Maximilian Heindl joined the Group in August 2016
as the manager in charge of production and technology at Paper (PM1 and PM2) and with overall
responsibility for Power. From August 1, 2017, Maximilian Heindl took over further responsibility within
the Group as a deputy member of the Executive Board and, effective January 1, 2019, he became a regular
member of the Executive Board and assumed the role of chief development officer. Maximilian Heindl’s
work and management experience outside the Group, his management roles at Paper and Power, his
appointment to the Executive Board and gradual assumption of further responsibilities are all part of a
deliberate, long-term succession plan for our founder and chief executive officer J¨urgen Heindl with the
goal of securing our future as a successful family-owned business into the next generation.

**OUR STRATEGY**

**Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through**
**controlled investments**

To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in
Europe in the long-term and to allow us to successfully meet ongoing and expected future market growth
and the requirements of our customers with regard to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to
continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of our
production facilities as part of our long-term ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy, as long as (i) we are confident we
can achieve payback periods for our investments that are aligned with the maturity profile and relevant
headroom under our financing arrangements, (ii) we maintain sufficient financial flexibility to weather
and/or adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole, and (iii) any such investments
would be consistent with our long-term target leverage. In addition to further capacity expansion, our ‘‘Two
Twentyfive’’ strategy, among other things, also contemplates a gradual technological transition and
generation change away from the use of corrugators with a trim width of 2.5m, which are installed and
currently in use at some of our older corrugated board production sites, to the use of more modern
corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our corrugated board production sites.

Following the successful completion of the ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site
(PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which commenced production in October 2015, we had already
accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals in 2016 and were already operating within our target
corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. However, in the short-term to
mid-term, we still intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our
corrugated board production capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market
opportunities for profitable growth, similar to those that led to the successful establishment of our most
recent production sites (PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12) in Pl¨ossberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland),
Drizzona (Italy) and Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom). In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we
intend to primarily achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion opportunities via greenfield
projects.

In addition to the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica,
Poland during 2017 and early 2018 following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, we
commenced production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, in early March
2018 and at our newest corrugated production site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, in January
2019. As with our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany and our corrugated
board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we established our production site (PW11) in Drizzona,
Italy, as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of a customer,
Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l., which allows us to supply this new customer largely without
freight and other logistics costs. The commencement of production at our corrugated board production
site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately
100,000 tons, also marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. With a total
investment of approximately A85-A90 million into the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega
plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom to replace our now decommissioned corrugated board
production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers from the new site, we have now also become a
significant player in the UK market. This newest corrugated board production site operates with a 3.35m

8


-----

trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than
double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), which we established in
2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width. We believe that the new production site, with its large
capacity and state-of-the-art equipment, is one of the largest and most efficient corrugated sheet board
plants globally and positions us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we have
historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins.

While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including the three packaging park
projects (PW9, PW10 and PW11), our newest corrugated board production site (PW12) in the United
Kingdom as well as the proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW13 and PW14), we are also
evaluating and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire attractive assets from competitors which
would complement our existing network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our
corrugated board production capacity and meet the other internal investment and financing criteria
described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our relationships with certain large
and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with significant new
customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated
board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers.

With the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland,
we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at
the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and
Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in
Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board
‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our
other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated
board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect
that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board
will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. In the short-term to mid-term, we
nevertheless intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated
board production capacity. We have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board
production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of
2019 or the first quarter of 2020. We expect to make total net investments (net of subsidies) of
approximately A60 million at this site, which is slightly higher than our earlier estimates of approximately
A50 million. This cost increase primarily relates to additional investments which will increase the annual
corrugated board production capacity of the new site to approximately 175,000 tons, from the originally
proposed capacity of approximately 140,000 tons. Higher than originally expected civil engineering costs
(due to the booming construction sector) also contributed to the expected overall cost increase. In
addition, we plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe
between 2020 and 2023, including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14), which we expect will
operate with a 3.35m trim width and have an annual corrugated board production capacity of up to 215,000
tons. We expect to invest approximately A70-75 million into this new plant, which will have capabilities
similar to our ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and, we plan, will commence
production in late 2020 or early 2021. Primarily to fund our expected investments into this new site, we
entered into the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and
the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, with total commitments of A75 million. For more details about
these New Senior Secured Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior
_Secured Erste Bank Facility’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured LBBW_
_Facilities’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’. As a_
result of these proposed additional corrugated board production sites, we expect our annual corrugated
board production capacity to increase from approximately 3.0 billion square meters (including our
corrugated board production sites (PW11 and PW12) in Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United
Kingdom) to approximately 4.2 billion square meters.

**Preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and**
**highly flexible manner through our new paper machine project**

In order to preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a
cost-efficient and highly flexible manner in sufficient quantities to meet the majority of the sourcing
requirements of the expanding corrugated board production within Board, we have also begun to actively
pursue the realization of a further paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.

9


-----

Earthworks for the new paper machine already started in January 2019 and, subject (among other things)
to obtaining the missing regulatory approvals and construction proceeding according to plan, we currently
expect this further state-of-the-art paper machine to start production in the second half of 2020, with a
total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 750,000 tons. Following completion of the ramp-up
phase of this potential further paper mill, this would mean an increase of the total annual containerboard
capacity of Paper from currently approximately 1,100,000 tons to approximately 1,850,000 tons. The new
paper machine (PM3) will have a 9.2m trim width, which would allow us to optimize containerboard
production to meet the requirements of the more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at
most of our newer corrugated board production sites, which would result in low volumes of cutting scrap
and higher productivity. Once PM3 has commenced operations, we also plan for further specialization of
our then three paper machines which we expect will further enhance the productivity of all our paper
machines as each paper mill will be able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. See also ‘‘—Our
_Strengths—Technology and innovation leader’’ above. We currently expect total net investment costs (i.e. net_
of expected subsidies) of approximately A465 million for this new paper machine project over a several year
period, including approximately A116.7 million of initial expenditures (e.g. for advanced payments for the
paper machine and certain preliminary work) we had already incurred as of the end of the first quarter of
2019. We expect to fund any such investments with a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from
our operating activities and additional borrowings, including drawings under the Existing Senior Secured
Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB
Facility and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility. The currently expected total net investment costs
of approximately A465 million in connection with the proposed establishment of our newest paper mill
(PM3) significantly exceed our earlier estimates of A375-400 million, primarily due to certain additional
strategic and value accretive investments we decided to make, which we expect to have significant
economical as well as ecological benefits once the new paper mill will be operational. A large portion of
the increase in the expected total net investment costs relates to investments into more energy-efficient
components as part of our overall waste-heat concept from the new paper mill. The installation of these
components is not legally mandated, but we expect it will result in significant cost savings in the mid- to
long-term as well as a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 151,000 tons per year. In addition, we decided to
install a closed cycle waste water treatment system. Once our new paper mill is operating at the full
intended capacity of 750,000 tons of containerboard, we expect that this closed cycle waste water treatment
system will help us to avoid approximately 3,775,000 m[3] of waste water per year, cut the fresh water
consumption of the new paper mill by 3,750,000 m[3] and reduce CO2 emissions by approximately a further
19,900 tons per year. At full capacity, the system is expected to produce approximately 65,000,000 kWh per
year of bio gas as part of the waste water treatment process. The paper mill will use this bio gas in
connection with its production process, cutting its natural gas consumption by approximately 7-8%. We
further believe that the proposed closed cycle waste water system will minimize our reliance on third party
waste water treatment facilities (which have led to capacity constraints at our existing paper machine
(PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany in the past) and result in significant related cost savings in the future.
We further decided to install (i) a steam turbine which will allow us to produce a portion of the electricity
requirements of the new paper mill in an environmentally friendly manner and (ii) a direct rail connection,
which will give us the option to ship a portion of our future production in an environmentally friendly
manner by rail and, we believe, result in savings of freight cost and other operational benefits. An increase
in the expected costs of the necessary civil engineering works, due to the booming construction sector, also
contributed to the overall increase in the expected total net investment costs.

**Achieving further cost-savings and efficiency improvements through further increased external**
**containerboard purchases**

We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona,
Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’
(PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our other corrugated
board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production
of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019. As already described in more
detail above, apart from a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany which we
have already commenced construction, we currently expect to establish up to three further corrugated
board production sites between 2020 and 2023 (including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14)
which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early 2021). See also ‘‘—Maintain and
_strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled_
_investments’’ above. Unless and until we complete the proposed new paper machine project (PM3), this_

10


-----

expected increase in our corrugated board production may cause us to further increase the level of internal
containerboard sales to Board (and thereby the level of integration between Paper and Board) in 2019 and
to increasingly rely on purchasing containerboard from third party suppliers. We believe that targeted
external containerboard purchases that meet the specific sourcing requirements of Board will give us
additional flexibility and provide us with opportunities to further optimize (i.e., minimize) our variable
costs, for example, by allowing us to purchase containerboard that matches the specific grade and optimal
trim-width required for our corrugated board production from time to time, from external suppliers
located in close proximity to the relevant Board plants. We hope this will allow us to further reduce cutting
scrap, further optimize logistics expenses and give us additional flexibility to optimize the utilization of our
existing paper machines (PM1 and PM2).

**Maintain cost leadership through continuous efficiency and profitability improvements**

In order to maintain profitability throughout the economic cycle, we have implemented a comprehensive
profitability improvement program (the ‘‘Continuous Improvement Program’’) to ensure the long-term
success of our Group. Our Continuous Improvement Program focuses on (i) improving the effectiveness of
our sales and marketing activities, (ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and (iii) stabilizing
our specific fixed costs in order to achieve sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost
leaders in our industry. Since 2012, our main focus in connection with our goal of achieving sales
excellence has been on (i) growing our external sales in excess of the general growth in market volumes
(and thereby increasing our market share), (ii) maximizing the impact of the introduction of our ‘‘next
generation’’ products into the market and (iii) optimizing our sales portfolio. As part of our efforts to
optimize our variable costs, we have focused on (i) reducing our consumption of raw materials,
(ii) optimizing our energy consumption and energy costs, especially at our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt
(PM2), and (iii) reducing the purchase prices of our key production factors, such as recycled paper, starch
and freight services. Overall, we have met or exceeded our targeted benefits through our Continuous
Improvement Program. We intend to continue to implement our Continuous Improvement Program and
identify and realize further improvement opportunities. See also ‘‘—Achieving further cost-savings and
_efficiency improvements through further increased external containerboard purchases’’ above._

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRADING UPDATE**

**Market Update**

We experienced an exceptionally strong performance during most of 2018, with a A95.1 million or 52.7%
increase in our EBITDA from A180.4 million in 2017 (22.4% of sales) to an exceptional A275.5 million in
2018 (28.5% of sales). Following this extraordinary performance in 2018, which was the result of our strong
operating performance and supported by unusual favorable market conditions, price levels for both
containerboard and corrugated board started to normalize towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, a
trend which continued in the first and second quarters of 2019. During the same period, prices for recycled
paper (our main raw material) remained stable at a relatively low level.

In April and May 2019, we saw a further softening of the prices for recycled containerboard of
approximately A40 per ton in total across Central and Western Europe. In line with historic market price
trends (i.e. the typical time lag between changes in input costs and the corresponding changes to the prices
for our products), we expect to continue to see at least a temporary impact on our margins and EBITDA
from the softening of price levels in recent months. Nevertheless, our EBITDA margin in the first quarter
of 2019 (27.4% of sales) was still significantly above our own five-year average (23% of sales for the period
between 2014 and 2018) and, we believe, also significantly above the industry average. Furthermore, as a
sign that containerboard prices appear to be stabilizing, two European containerboard producers recently
announced price increases for recycled containerboard of A60 per ton, effective as of June 2019. We also
see good availability of recycled paper, which may result in price reductions for recycled paper.

**New Senior Secured Facilities**

On May 31, 2019, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into the A30.0 million New Senior Secured Erste
Bank Facility, the A30.0 million New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and the A15.0 million New Senior
Secured SaarLB Facility (together the ‘‘New Senior Secured Facilities’’), primarily to fund the
approximately A70-75 million of expected total investment into our proposed new corrugated board ‘‘mega
plant’’ (PW14). The utilization of the New Senior Secured Facilities is subject to certain conditions
precedent. We expect to satisfy all remaining conditions precedent on or around the issue date of the

Additional Notes. As a result, the New Senior Secured Facilities will remain undrawn on the issue date of
the Additional Notes. We may utilize the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured
LBBW Facilities and the new Senior Secured SaarLB Facility until June, 2021, May, 2020 and May, 2020,
respectively. For more details about the New Senior Secured Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’._

**Trading Update**

Based on management accounts, our operating performance for the month of April 2019 showed a strong
corrugated board volume increase of 9.0% compared to April 2018, supported by (i) the successful and
ongoing ramp-up following the commencement of production at our production site (PW11) in Drizzona,
Italy in early March 2018, (ii) the commencement of production in January 2019 and subsequent ramp-up
at our newest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and (iii) strong
volume growth at our corrugated board operations in Poland. However, this increase in the volume of
corrugated board sold was more than offset by a lower volume of externally sold containerboard and lower
sales prices for both corrugated board and containerboard, which resulted in an approximately 3.8%
decrease in sales from approximately A78.6 million in April 2018 to approximately A75.6 million in April
2019.Our EBITDA remained basically stable at A19.1 million in April 2019 compared to approximately
A19.2 million in April 2018.

The foregoing financial information is based on internal unaudited consolidated monthly accounts for the
months of April 2019 and 2018, respectively, which were prepared by and are the responsibility of our
management. This financial information has not been audited, reviewed, compiled or the subject of any
procedures by our independent auditors or any other audit firm and no opinion nor any other form of
assurance is expressed with respect thereto. The foregoing financial information is inherently subject to
modification during the preparation of our financial statements as of and for the three months ended
June 30, 2019. The presented financial information is not representative for any three-month or twelvemonth period and should not be regarded as an indication, forecast or representation by us or any other
person regarding our future financial performance for the three months ended June 30, 2019 or the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2019. See ‘‘Forward-Looking Statements’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors’’ for a more complete
discussion of certain factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations.

We currently also expect a strong increase in corrugated board volume for the full second quarter of 2019,
compared to the second quarter of 2018. However, any potential future decreases in corrugated board
prices as a result of the recent containerboard price decreases (see ‘‘—Market Update’’ above) would have
a negative impact on our results of operations.

**THE REFINANCING**

The ‘‘Refinancing’’ refers to the issuance of A150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes
pursuant to the Offering and the use of the proceeds from the Offering, together with cash-in-hand, (i) to

by Commerzbank itself, which are fully utilized as of the date of this offering memorandum. The A25.0 million Facility C under
the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the A25.0 million Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the A45.0 million
Facility A under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities remain undrawn as of the date of this offering

entered into the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility which provided for PLN 107 million of committed credit. In addition, on
May 31, 2016, Progroup Board sp. z o.o., as borrower, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as guarantors, entered into the 2016
Senior Secured PLN Facility to fund the establishment of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland.

58.9 million (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A13.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006,
which was the exchange rate of the zloty against the euro reported by the National Bank of Poland on March 31, 2019) in
borrowings under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding, and PLN 76.0 million (carrying amount at
March 31, 2019: A17.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006) in borrowings under the 2016
Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the same amounts of
borrowings remain outstanding under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility and under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility.

March 31, 2019 do not reflect PLN 5.4 million and PLN 4.0 million, respectively, in scheduled repayments under the 2015
Senior Secured PLN Facility and the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility we will be required to make on June 30, 2019. For more

(1) Total output (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as the sum of sales, increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in
process, other operating income and other own work capitalized.

(2) Gross profit (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated by deducting cost of materials from total output.

(3) EBITDA (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as sales, plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process,
_plus other operating income (excluding any extraordinary income), plus other own work capitalized, minus costs of materials,_
_minus personnel expenses,_ _minus other operating expenses (excluding any extraordinary expenses),_ _minus other taxes. In_
response to changes to German GAAP, which have resulted in certain changes to the presentation of our financial information
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 in the table above, we have adjusted the way we calculate EBITDA to ensure
consistency and comparability with our EBITDA reported for prior periods. While our reported EBITDA therefore excludes
the impact of any ‘‘extraordinary’’ items for all periods presented, it has not yet been adjusted for ‘‘items of exceptional size or
incidence’’, which is a new concept under German GAAP introduced by the BilRUG. Excluding the negative effect of
A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’ (including A13.9 million in additional costs as expenditure of
exceptional size or incidence and A2.1 million in lost sales) related to a longer than scheduled shutdown of the CHP in 2016, our
EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 would have been A170.7 million.

(4) Consolidated net income/(net loss) before income tax (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated by adding taxes on income
back to consolidated net income/(net loss) for the period.

(5) We define trade working capital (not a German GAAP measure) as inventories plus trade receivables, minus trade payables.

activities.

(10) Net cash flow (not a German GAAP measure) is defined as net change in cash funds as presented in the Consolidated Cash
Flow Statement.

(11) We present adjusted cash flow available for debt service (not a German GAAP measure) as a measure of normalized free cash
flow which can be used to service debt. We calculate adjusted cash flow available for debt service as cash flow available for debt
service adjusted for the effects of extraordinary net income/(loss) as well as for the A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional size or
incidence’’ (including A13.9 million in additional costs as expenditure of exceptional size or incidence and A2.1 million in lost
sales) related to a longer than scheduled shutdown of the CHP in 2016.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Additional Notes to be issued in the Offering involves a high degree of risk. In addition to_
_the other information contained in this offering memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk_
_factors before purchasing the Additional Notes. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our_
_margins and results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected, which in_
_turn could adversely affect our ability to repay the Additional Notes. The risks described below are not the only_
_risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be_
_immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects._
_In any such case, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on the Additional Notes when due and you_
_may lose all or part of your investment in the Additional Notes._

_This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of_
_various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See ‘‘Forward-_
_Looking Statements’’._

**RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS**

**Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity, which is**
**dependent upon factors beyond our control.**

Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity. Increased levels
of economic growth and activity typically result in higher per-capita use of packaging materials, both with
respect to transportation of goods and consumer presentation. This increase in the use of packaging
materials (including paper-based packaging materials), in turn, results in an increase in the demand for our
recycled containerboard and corrugated board products. Because the markets for containerboard and
corrugated board products in the developed economies in which we primarily operate are generally
mature, historically there has been a close correlation between general economic growth and demand for
packaging products such as corrugated containers and, therefore, for their component materials such as
containerboard and corrugated board. As a result, our industry is affected by economic conditions in our
markets, including changes in national, regional and local unemployment levels, shifts in consumer
spending patterns, credit availability, and business and consumer confidence. Disruptions in the overall
economy and volatility in the financial markets could reduce consumer confidence, negatively affecting
consumer spending, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. We have
been impacted by difficult economic conditions in the past. The European debt crisis, for example, resulted
in market uncertainty generally and in weak economic conditions, particularly in the Eurozone, which had
a significant negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We are unable to predict
the timing or duration of any downturn in the economy that may occur in the future or the timing or rate at
which economic conditions in our markets may recover in the case of any such downturn. While we
experienced historically strong operating results in 2016, 2017 and in particular 2018, we believe it is
unlikely that our exceptionally strong operating performance in 2018 will continue or that our margins
and/or EBITDA will not materially decline.

**The cyclical nature of our industry often results in overcapacity which negatively impacts our results of**
**operations.**

We principally generate revenue through the sale of containerboard and corrugated board. Our mills
primarily sell the containerboard we produce to Group-owned corrugated board plants, and we sell our
corrugated board to our third-party customers in the packaging industry. Our operating results are
therefore impacted by the packaging industry’s historical cyclical pattern, with periods of overcapacity and
resulting pressure on pricing of packaging products such as corrugated containers and, in turn, their
component materials such as containerboard and corrugated board. This cyclicality results, in part, from
significant imbalances in supply and demand for containerboard. On the one hand, containerboard
production capacity cannot be readily adapted to reflect changing market conditions, due to the high
capital intensity of facilities such as containerboard mills (which generally continue production as long as
paper prices are sufficient to cover their marginal costs), the long lead time between the planning and
completion of new containerboard mills and the fact that new additions of containerboard capacity tend to
be large relative to the overall demand for the product. On the other hand, significant containerboard and
corrugated board price reductions and inventory growth have resulted when capacity has exceeded
demand. In addition, there is the potential to convert graphic and newsprint paper machines into

26


-----

containerboard machines which has happened recently both in Europe and the United States, and which
may contribute to overcapacity. Consequently, the containerboard and corrugated board industry has from
time to time experienced periods of substantial overcapacity and there can be no assurance that this will
not reoccur. Overcapacity in the European market has generally had a negative impact on prices. See
‘‘Industry and Competition—End-Markets Dynamics’’ and ‘‘Industry and Competition—Key Market
_Developments’’._

In the absence of sufficient economic growth to generate increased demand or the closure of facilities
(either temporarily or permanently) to mitigate the effect, new capacity can cause a period of regional
overcapacity which may lead to downward pricing and margin pressure. In periods of overcapacity, industry
participants may stop operating certain of their production facilities periodically to reduce inventory levels.
In the past, many leading paper manufacturers have reacted to reduced demand by taking downtime and
by rationalizing high-cost and inefficient capacity. Due to the high level of integration between our two
mills and our corrugated board production sites, it is unlikely that we would take downtime at our mills for
any significant length of time, but even if we did so and our competitors continue production at high levels,
our sales volumes could be adversely affected without any significant offsetting benefit of improved prices
in the market. In the event that the industry as a whole does not take sufficient downtime or other
measures to reduce capacity during any periods of overcapacity, this could have a material adverse effect
on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

Overcapacity in the European containerboard and/or corrugated board markets could be further
exacerbated by an increase of imports from other regions and/or a decrease of exports by European
producers to other regions, as a result of a variety of factors. For example, in the event that producers in
other regions (particularly the United States and China) experience overcapacity within their own local
and regional markets, they may seek to increase their level of exports to Europe and do so at lower pricing
levels. This could adversely affect our selling prices and profitability. In addition, the level of exports of
containerboard from or to Europe also depends on relevant freight rates and currency rates. A strong
euro, for example, can have a negative effect on (U.S. dollar-denominated) exports by European
containerboard manufacturers with a negative (for our business) effect on the supply and demand balance
and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a
sustained period has, in the past, also resulted in lower sales by other European manufacturers who ship
products in corrugated packaging, resulting in lower European demand for corrugated packaging, and
therefore for our containerboard and corrugated board. See also ‘‘—We are exposed to currency exchange
_rate fluctuations’’._

**We could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more important customers and the nature of, and close**
**relationships with, our small and medium-sized customers exposes us certain risks.**

In 2016, 2017, 2018 and in the first three months of 2019, no single customer represented more than 5% of
our total sales. However, our level of customer concentration may increase in the future as a number of
industries have experienced consolidation in the past and the packaging industry in which our customers
operate may also be affected by consolidation in the future. In addition, while no particular customer is
significant to our Group as a whole, a number of our customers account for a significant portion of the
sales volumes of one or more of our individual corrugated production sites. Therefore, a loss of one or
more of those customers could have a material adverse effect on the utilization and results of operation of
the affected corrugated board production sites and negative impact our Group’s total sales. For example,
one of our largest customers, which accounted for 4% of our total sales in 2016, commenced production at
its own, newly-established corrugated board production facility at the end of 2016. As a result, we lost
approximately 90% of our related corrugated board sales with that customer in 2017. If other Board
customers similarly establish their own corrugated board production facilities, it is likely that we would also
lose most or all of our related corrugated board sales to any such customers. In addition, a large
proportion of our customers are small- or medium-sized, family-owned businesses that are managed by
members of the owner family. A sale of any of those businesses to one of our competitors or to a box
manufacturer with its own corrugated board production, either in connection with a succession event or
otherwise, may therefore lead to a loss of the relevant customer. Furthermore, our own performance and
potential future growth generally depends, to a large extent, on the performance of our customers, which
are exposed to many of the same risks as our own business. Our small- and medium-sized customers may
also be particularly vulnerable (i) to competition from larger competitors with greater financial resources
and which are able to capitalize on their economies of scale and (ii) to pricing pressure from their own,
often much larger customers.

**The standardized nature of containerboard could result in downward pressure on pricing and, as a**
**consequence, lower earnings.**

Containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer, and this standardization has led to
intensified price competition. This, in turn, creates significant downward pressure on the prices of our
products during periods of market overcapacity or weak demand, which could reduce sales and have a
material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. Our business has
in the past faced significant downward pricing pressure, including as a result of standardization in the
markets in which we operate. Given the general upward trend in almost all our input costs and the
potential for an increase in the currently stable energy prices, we expect we will need to further increase
prices in the mid- to long-term to ensure that earnings from recycled containerboard remain at a long-term
sustainable economic level. We are likely to continue to be exposed to such factors in the future. If we are
unable to adjust our cost base or achieve economies of scale comparable to our competitors, pricing
pressure could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operation and financial
condition.

**Operational disruptions at our facilities, in particular our two mills, could have a material adverse effect on**
**our margins, results of operations and financial condition.**

We currently operate two containerboard mills in Germany, which account for all of our containerboard
production. Each of them is, therefore, critical to our business. If operations at either of our two mills were
interrupted for any significant length of time, either because of natural disasters (such as flooding or fire),
man-made disruptions (such as labor strikes), failure to obtain raw materials, technical defects, accidents
or for any other reason, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial position. For example, a technical defect at our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt caused multiple
shutdowns during 2011 and 2012, resulting in significant loss of containerboard production and significant
financial loss, which was only partly covered by compensation payments from one of our equipment
manufacturers in the following year. In addition, due to the high level of integration between our two mills
and our corrugated board production sites, any significant interruption of our containerboard production
at one or both of our mills would also have a significant adverse effect on our corrugated board production
and our ability to supply our corrugated board customers. Any significant disruptions at one or more of our
corrugated board production sites, either because of problems with our containerboard supply (either from
our two mills or from external suppliers) or for any of the other reasons listed above, could also have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the currently
very high level of utilization of most our production sites, our ability to fulfill customer orders from
alternative sites in case of a significant disruption at one of more production sites is limited. Finally, the
operation of most of our production sites also depends on key services and infrastructure provided by third
parties. For example, we rely on highly specialized employees of our equipment suppliers to ensure the
proper maintenance and repair of our production equipment. In addition, the uninterrupted operation of
our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt depends, among other things, on the availability of a waste water
treatment plant operated by the local municipal utility and a secure supply of production steam either by
the CHP and/or by a neighboring power plant which we use as a back-up solution. In 2016, 2017 and 2018,
capacity limitations of the local waste water treatment plant in Eisenh¨uttenstadt due to technical faults
have led to temporary reductions in the containerboard production capacity of our paper machine PM2.
Significant future capacity limitations of the local waste water treatment plant or a shutdown of the local
waste water treatment plant would require us to reduce or shutdown containerboard production at our
paper machine PM2, as there are no alternative local water treatment options. In addition, due to technical
faults in the steam pipeline that connects our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt to the neighboring power plant,
there is no guarantee that this back-up solution will be available in the event of maintenance or other
shutdowns of the CHP. Furthermore, our insurance coverage may be inadequate or not cover all losses. See
‘‘—Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the risks we may face and if we were no longer
_covered by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms or at_
_all’’. If one or more of the aforementioned risks materializes, this could have a material adverse effect on_
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**We are exposed to intense competition in the containerboard and corrugated board industry.**

We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. The containerboard and corrugated board
industry is characterized by a high level of price competition as well as other competitive factors, including
innovation, design, quality and service. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with

28


-----

respect to any key competitive factor, our margins, results of operations and financial condition could be
adversely affected. Pricing pressure could arise from, among other things, limited demand growth and
existing overcapacity in the market in question, new competitors entering the market, capacity increases by
competitors, including by converting, enhancing or intensifying the use of existing production facilities or
by setting up additional production facilities, price reductions by competitors, the ability of competitors to
capitalize on their economies of scale and create excess product supply, the ability of competitors to
operate or successfully relocate or open production facilities in countries where production costs are lower
than those in which we operate and the access of competitors to new technology which we do not possess.

**We are exposed to the risk of product substitution.**

The products of our customers in the paper-based packaging industry compete with other forms of
packaging, principally reusable plastic containers. Substitution of plastic containers for corrugated
containers may increase in the future and other substitute products may be introduced. Future packaging
developments and trends may drive further substitution. Substitution is also possible between solidboard
packaging and corrugated containers, with the generally lower cost of corrugated containers offset by the
moisture and temperature handling characteristics of solidboard packaging. In addition, there has
generally been increasing scrutiny of single-use packaging, its sustainability and impact on the
environment. While the primary focus of this increasing scrutiny has, so far, been on plastic packaging,
there can be no guarantee that paper-based packaging will not also face increasing scrutiny, which may
result in regulatory action and/or changes in customer preferences in favor of reusable forms of packaging.
Any significant substitution away from paper-based packaging products or from corrugated board to
solidboard may adversely affect the demand for our products and therefore our results of operation and
profitability.

**Price fluctuations in raw materials and our ability to pass on price increases could affect our results of**
**operations.**

Our margins and overall profitability are significantly affected by the price of raw materials and the length
of time it takes us to translate price increases in raw materials and other input costs into prices we charge
for third-party sales of containerboard and corrugated board. To the extent our containerboard is sold
internally, our profitability will only be affected by the ability to recover any price increases from thirdparty sales of corrugated board to our third party customers in the packaging industry. Furthermore, to the
extent that selling prices fall, if we are unable to generate cost savings through producing products more
efficiently or lower our fixed costs, our results may be negatively affected.

In total, raw materials accounted for 75.2%, 73.5% and 71.6%, respectively, of our cost of materials in the
year ended 2017 and 2018 and the first three months of 2019. Our primary raw materials are recycled
paper, particularly old corrugated containers, and containerboard. The prices for these raw materials tend
to be volatile, and price fluctuations affect our margins. Recycled paper is used in the manufacture of our
containerboard products and is purchased in increasingly competitive, price-sensitive markets. Recycled
paper has historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality and high price volatility over short periods and
may do so again in the future. In particular, the price of recycled paper depends on a variety of factors over
which we have no control, including environmental and conservation regulations, natural disasters and
weather. A decrease in the supply of such raw materials has caused, and any such decrease in the future
can be expected to cause, higher costs of materials. In addition, the increase in demand for products
manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled paper has in the past caused an occasional supply or
demand imbalance in the market for recycled paper. Chinese purchasers have been in the recycled paper
market for a number of years and have become material purchasers in the sector due to significant ongoing
expansion of their recycled containerboard mills’ capacity. Other important drivers of recycled paper prices
are collection rates of recycled paper as well as freight rates and exchange rates, which both affect the level
of exports of recycled paper from Europe to other markets. In the past, significant decreases in the prices
for recycled paper have led to a reduction in collection activity, which, in turn, can lead to supply shortages.
The effect of these and other factors has been to create volatility with respect to the price of recycled
paper, and we expect recycled paper prices to continue to fluctuate based upon supply and demand
characteristics.

In addition to recycled paper, which we use extensively in our containerboard production at our two mills,
we also purchase containerboard from external suppliers as a raw material for our corrugated board
production. The prices of containerboard can also be highly volatile. See also ‘‘—Demand for our products
_is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity, which is dependent upon factors beyond our_

29


-----

_control’’ and ‘‘—The cyclical nature of our industry often results in overcapacity which negatively impacts our_
_results of operations’’ above, as well as ‘‘—We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations’’ below._

An important driver of recycled paper prices is the balance of supply and demand for paper products in
general as well as collection rates of recycled paper. When the price of recycled paper begins to rise,
containerboard manufacturers attempt to raise their prices to preserve profit margins, which generally
narrow as a result of increased raw material costs. It typically takes approximately two to three months for
the containerboard mills to pass on their raw material price increases to the corrugated board
manufacturers. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover
containerboard cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for manufacturers,
including us, to pass these increases on to their customers. In particular during periods of rising recycled
paper prices, our profitability has therefore historically been adversely affected.

However, our ability to pass the costs of our raw materials and other input costs on to our packaging
customers depends on a number of other factors, including the supply and demand balance for
containerboard and corrugated board in a particular region and the ability of our customers to maintain or
increase prices with their own customers. We generate almost all of our sales through purchase orders
from our customers based on our price lists which we adjust in response to market price movements and
only have very few contracts with our customers which provide minimum purchase obligations and/or
pricing clauses that would allow us to automatically pass increased costs on to our customers. As a result of
these factors, there can be no guarantee that the price of recycled paper and the prices for our
containerboard and corrugated board products will always be closely correlated. Any extended mismatch
between the price of recycled paper and the market prices for our products could have a significant effect
on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

For example, between 2009 and 2010, our results of operations and financial condition deteriorated. There
were two main reasons for this deterioration. First, the global financial and economic crisis led to a
significant drop in the price of recycled paper, our main raw material, in the second half of 2008, but also
to a significant decrease in the demand for our products and a corresponding decrease in the market prices
for both containerboard and corrugated board. Following the significant drop in the prices for recycled
paper in the second half of 2008, the prices for recycled paper started to recover in the first half of 2009,
notwithstanding the continuing economic weakness and contrary to historic trends. This, in turn, led to a
compression of our margins up to a point during the third quarter of 2009 when the sales prices for some
of our finished products were insufficient to cover our variable input costs. As a result, we incurred
significant losses and a few of our competitors were forced to close or mothball less efficient production
facilities, which led at least temporarily to a drop in market-wide containerboard and corrugated board
capacity. Our margins only returned to near sustainable levels towards the end of 2010, following multiple
rounds of price increases for recycled paper, containerboard and corrugated board.

**Increased energy costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results**
**of operation.**

Our production processes, in particular our containerboard production at our two mills, are energy
intensive, and energy costs, including costs for electricity, gas and steam, represent a significant portion of
our total cost of materials. As described in more detail under ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—The CHP_
_Acquisition’’, effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH from_
EnBW, the CHP and certain related assets outright. As a result thereof, we started producing a significant
portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves. Despite the
completion of the CHP Acquisition our production processes are nevertheless reliant on third parties for
the supply of energy. Market prices for energy, in particular for electricity, oil and natural gas, have
historically been volatile and have had a corresponding effect on our production costs. If energy prices
increase in the future, this would increase our production costs, which could consequently have a material
adverse effect on our profitability. See also ‘‘—Our energy costs, in particular in Germany, are dependent on
_the regulatory framework for the electricity sector, which is subject to constant change and, in addition, we may_
_face material cost increases if we lose certain financial privileges which we benefit from in Germany with regard_
_to the Renewable Energies Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’) surcharge and network access fees and_
_other fees’’ below._

Although we expect that the CHP Acquisition will lead to a sustained reduction of our energy costs, as
described in more detail under ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results

30


-----

_of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—The CHP Acquisition’’, neither the CHP_
Acquisition nor the other measures we have taken to reduce our exposure to fluctuating energy prices may
be adequate and they may even be counter-productive. Following completion of the CHP Acquisition, we
have become directly responsible for, and are bearing all risks related to, the day-to-day operation of the
CHP, which includes responsibility for unexpected repair costs, for any shutdowns of the CHP as well as
the operational risks associated with the disposal of the ash generated by the CHP (i.e., that we are unable
to procure the proper disposal of the ash and may therefore be forced to shut down the CHP). There can
be no guarantee that the operating expenses for the CHP will not increase in the future. See also’’—We
_may not be successful in operating the CHP ourselves in the long run’’. In addition, we bear the full economic_
risk related to the procurement of refuse-derived fuels for the CHP. Further, our outside suppliers may
default on their obligations under our refuse-derived fuel supply agreements with them. Any significant
increase in market prices, transportation costs, grid fees or taxes (including by reduction of tax benefits)
associated with the supply of energy would also increase our operating costs. Any inability or delay in
passing on increases in energy costs to our customers or any interruption or shortage of energy supply may
negatively impact our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**Our energy costs, in particular in Germany, are dependent on the regulatory framework for the electricity**
**sector, which is subject to constant change and, in addition, we may face material cost increases if we lose**
**certain financial privileges which we benefit from in Germany with regard to the Renewable Energies Act**
**(Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’) surcharge and network access fees and other fees.**

In addition to general market dynamics, our energy costs are influenced by the relevant regulatory
framework for the electricity sector both on the European and the national level. In the past years, this
regulatory framework has been subject to substantial change and it will continue to be subject to change in
the future. Such change is not only due to legislative reforms, but is also prompted by administrative and
judicial decisions.

In Germany, where both our mills are located, our energy costs have been strongly impacted by regulatory
decisions related to the so-called ‘‘Energiewende’’, a significant shift in government policy following the
nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan in 2011. This new German energy policy focuses on promoting the
development of renewable energy sources and contemplates the complete cessation of the production of
nuclear power by 2021. To mitigate the impact of the resulting significant increases in electricity prices for
energy-intensive industries, the German government adopted rules that provide for various businesses,
including us, to be reimbursed for certain infrastructure investment surcharges necessary for the
implementation of the ‘‘Energiewende’’. However, those rules have not only been subject to challenges in
German courts and EU scrutiny as potentially illegal subsidies, but also continue to be the subject of
political scrutiny by various interest groups. Although the relevant rules have been modified to address
certain of these concerns, there is no guarantee that they will not change again or that we will continue to
be able to benefit from current accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes.
In particular, it cannot be ruled out that the EU may introduce more stringent conditions for any such
accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes in the future and/or may further
restrict the ability of companies to combine benefits of different reduction schemes (so-called
‘‘cumulation’’). As an ‘‘energy-intensive enterprise’’, we have historically benefitted, and in 2019 we
continued to benefit, from considerable reductions of the so-called EEG surcharge (EEG Umlage), a
charge which is levied on electricity consumers to fund the financial promotion of renewable energy
sources. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and the first three months of 2019, for example, such reductions decreased our
energy costs by approximately A28.6 million, A30.4 million, A30.3 million and A7 million, respectively.

Other countries in which we operate production facilities or may operate production facilities in the future,
may adopt similar policies in order to promote the usage of renewable energy sources. As a consequence
thereof, the energy price could increase and there can be no guarantee that we will be reimbursed to the
extent to which the price increased, to the same extent as currently in Germany or even at all. This could
consequently adversely affect the revenue of our production facility and may force us to adopt capitalintensive countering measures or ultimately close the plant. In addition, we currently benefit from various
other privileges and exemptions from energy-related laws and regulations in Germany, including benefits
pursuant to § 19 of the German Ordinance on Electricity Network Access Fees
(Stromnetzentgeltverordnung), the German Electricity Tax Act (Stromsteuergesetz) and other laws and
regulations. Should we lose any or all of these privileges and exemptions, this could have a material
adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. Finally, compliance with

31


-----

the EU Emission Trading Scheme Directive (the ‘‘ETS’’) could significantly increase our costs. Our two
existing mills are, and our proposed third mill (PM3) will be, subject to the ETS.

The paper industry was granted the status as a so-called ‘‘Carbon Leakage’’ sector and our existing two
mills have therefore been allocated a certain amount of CO2 emission certificates for free. Historically, the
collective CO2 allocations granted to our two existing mills have exceeded our collective annual CO2
emissions. The revised ETS Directive for the period 2013-2020, however, has been slowly reversing this
excess position over time. The free allocation rules for the fourth trading period (2021-2030), which were
adopted in December 2018, still contemplate the allocation of free CO2 emission certificates for Carbon
Leakage industries, and the latest Carbon Leakage list for the years 2021-2030 adopted by the European
Commission effective as of May 2019 still lists the paper industry as threatened by Carbon Leakage for this
upcoming trading period. As a result, we currently expect that our two existing mills and our proposed new
mill (PM3) will continue to be allocated at least a portion of the CO2 emission certificates required for
their operation free of charge. However, even with these expected free CO2 allocations, there is
considerable risk that in the future our costs will significantly increase and will not be recovered through
higher prices for our end products. See also ‘‘Business—Regulatory Environment—Regulation governing the
_operation of the CHP’’._

**We may fail in successfully implementing our business strategy.**

In order to continue to realize cost savings or process optimizations, we must continue to optimize our
costs, improve our procurement process, realize certain operating efficiencies and improve the efficiency of
our sales force. Key focus areas of our Continuous Improvement Program involve (i) improving the
effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities, (ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and
(iii) stabilizing our specific fixed costs in order to achieve sales excellence and maintain our position as one
of the cost leaders in our industry. As we are unable to influence commodity and energy prices directly, our
competitiveness and long-term profitability are, to a significant degree, dependent upon our ability to
reduce costs (including the costs of raw materials and consumables such as power, labor and transport) and
maintain low-cost, efficient operations. Our production costs are also significantly affected by production
volumes and, therefore, our ability to maintain production levels and maximize capacity utilization will be a
key factor in determining our overall cost competitiveness. Our ability to maintain earnings and undertake
capital expenditure could be adversely affected in the event of a sustained material fall in prices for our
products, an appreciable rise in our production costs or a decline in our production volumes. A number of
factors beyond our control, such as operating disruptions, personnel turnover, competition, unforeseen
delays in implementing initiatives and general economic and industry conditions as well as future
development on the energy markets, could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our strategy
by limiting our ability to grow or our ability to reduce costs and increase efficiency which could have a
material adverse effect on our business. We may not be successful in achieving cost savings, generating
growth and increasing our cash flows and profitability.

**Efforts to improve our operational efficiency in accordance with our business plan may not be effective and**
**may adversely impact our sales and marketing operations, product development and production processes.**

We have implemented and are continuing to implement various projects to improve our operational
efficiency, including our production network and processes as well as sales, marketing, procurement and
product development. Some of these operational improvement initiatives and cost reduction measures
represent important aspects of our business plan, in particular our initiatives in connection with the
continuing optimization of our paper machine PM2 and our continuing efforts to further optimize
production of our paper machine PM1 and our corrugators. See also ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—_
_Continuous Improvement Program’’ and ‘‘Business—Our Strategy—Maintain cost leadership through_
_continuous efficiency and profitability improvements’’._

If our ongoing efforts to improve our operational efficiency fail or the implementation of cost
improvement measures are not effective, sustainable or achievable within the anticipated time frame, the
quality and cost of our products and our competitive position in the industry may suffer. Additionally,
because we have factored the expected benefits of these improvement initiatives and cost reduction
measures into our business plan, our inability to successfully execute these plans or our failure to realize
the expected economic benefits of these plans could have a material adverse effect on our margins and
results of operations and financial condition.

**The costs and difficulties of integrating complementary businesses through organic and acquisitive**
**expansion could impede our future growth and adversely affect our competitiveness.**

To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in
Europe in the long-term and to allow us to successfully meet ongoing and expected future market growth
and the requirements of our customers with regard to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to
continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of our
production facilities as part of our long-term ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy. In addition to the fast and
successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland in 2017 and early
2018 following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, we commenced production at our
new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, and our newest
corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom in January 2019. In the
short-term to mid-term, we intend to continue to make significant further investments in expanding our
corrugated board production capacity, and we have already commenced construction of a further
corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in
the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020) and currently expect to establish up to three further
corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023, including a further
corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early
2021. In order to preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a
cost-efficient and highly flexible manner in sufficient quantities to meet the majority of the sourcing
requirements of the expanding corrugated board production within Progroup Board, we have also begun to
actively pursue the realization of a further paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.
We currently expect total net investment costs (i.e. net of expected subsidies) of approximately
A465 million for just this new paper machine project over a several year period, including approximately
A116.7 million of initial expenditures (e.g. for advance payments for the paper machine and certain
preliminary work) we had already incurred as of the end of the first quarter of 2019. See also ‘‘Business—
_Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in_
_Europe through controlled investments’’ below._

Risks that we could face with respect to any those proposed and any potential further expansion project
may include:

  - greater than expected costs and management time and effort involved in identifying, completing
and integrating expansions, acquisitions, packaging park projects or joint ventures;

   - potential disruption of our ongoing business and difficulties in maintaining our internal control
environment, information systems and procedures;

   - the inability to successfully integrate the services, products and personnel of any acquisition into our
operations or to realize any expected cost savings or other synergy benefits from any acquisition;

  - customer overlap/loss of customers supplied prior to the acquisition by both us and the acquired
group;

   - incurrence of unexpected, actual or contingent liabilities;

  - a need to incur debt, which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses due to
increased debt service obligations; and

  - lack of return on our investment, including as a result of increased competition for acquisition
targets and higher purchase prices for such acquisitions.

The impact of any such proposed and potential future expansion projects, acquisitions or joint ventures on
us cannot be predicted and any of the risks outlined above, should they materialize, could have a material
adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**The successful implementation of our proposed new paper machine project (PM3) poses significant**
**challenges.**

Due to the much larger size, higher level of complexity and longer implementation timeframe of a paper
machine project, compared to the establishment of a new corrugated board production site, the risks
related to our new paper machine project (PM3) are proportionately higher and manifold. This includes
significant risks related to the actual technical start-up of the paper machine as a whole, as each paper
machine project involves a certain level of customization, which means that spare parts and/or replacement

33


-----

parts for key components may not be readily available and that (sometimes significant) start-up delays are
not uncommon. In addition, certain features of our paper machine project, in particular the proposed
closed cycle waste water treatment system, represent ‘‘industry firsts’’, which means that the technology
and equipment we are proposing to install are not yet fully proven, at least not on the scale of our
proposed paper machine project. Should we encounter any significant technical problems in connection
with the start up of the paper machine itself and/or the proposed closed cycle water treatment system, this
could lead to a significantly delayed start-up of the paper machine. This, in turn, could have severe
follow-on consequences, such as (i) a potential loss of an expected aggregate total of up to A15 million in
repayment grants in relation to Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, Facility A of the
Existing Commerzbank Facilities and the Existing SaarLB Facility; (ii) the loss of approximately
A22.0 million in reductions of the so-called EEG surcharge (EEG Umlage) with regard to 2021 under the
German Renewable Energy Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’) as well as (iii) the loss of
production volume of containerboard and related supply to our corrugated board operations.

Once our new paper mill has commenced operation, among other risks, we will further face (i) the risk of
having to procure the very large volumes of recycled paper required to operate our new paper machine at
full capacity, (ii) the risk of potentially having to purchase additional CO2 allowances as we do not yet
know the number of free CO2 allowances we will get allocated as well as (iii) the significant risk of a
temporary overcapacity in the European containerboard market as a number of our competitors have also
commenced or announced paper machine projects with a similar completion timetable. Should any of
these (or other) risks in connection with the implementation of our new paper machine project materialize,
this could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, a final approval under the German Emissions Act (BImSchG), which is required for the
operation of the proposed new paper mill, remains pending. Based on our interactions with the relevant
authorities, we currently expect to receive the relevant approval in July 2019. Failure to receive this final
approval could cause us to significantly delay our paper machine project, abandon the currently proposed
site for the project and/or incur significant write-offs in connection with the proposed project.

**We are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations.**

Given the growing geographic spread of our operations, we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange
rate fluctuations. For example, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and Poland do not use the euro
as their national currency. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 7%, 7% and 16% of our total sales
derived from sales in British pounds, Czech koruna and Polish zloty, respectively. In addition, we currently
finance several of our foreign subsidiaries, including subsidiaries outside the euro zone, through
borrowings in euro.

To reduce (but not eliminate) our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the Polish
zloty, Progroup Board sp. z o.o. entered into the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility on December 1, 2015 to
pay back euro denominated intra Group loans. To finance the investment in our corrugated board
production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, Progroup Board sp. z o.o. entered into the 2016 Senior
Secured PLN Facility on May 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2019, PLN 58.9 million (carrying amount at
March 31, 2019: A13.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006, which was the
exchange rate of the zloty against the euro reported by the National Bank of Poland on March 31, 2019) in
borrowings under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding, and PLN 76.0 million
(carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A17.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN
4.3006) in borrowings under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding. As of the date of
this offering memorandum, the same amounts of borrowings remain outstanding under the 2015 Senior
Secured PLN Facility and under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility. The adjusted figures do not reflect
PLN 5.4 million and PLN 4.0 million, respectively, in scheduled repayments under the 2015 Senior Secured
PLN Facility and the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility we will be required to make on June 30, 2019. For
more details about the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, including scheduled repayments on the
Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing
_Senior Secured PLN Facilities’’._

To reduce (but not eliminate) our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the British
pound, Progroup Board Ltd. entered into the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility on December 21, 2017.
As of March 31, 2019, we had drawn GBP3.0 million under the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility
(carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A3.495 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = GBP
0.8583, which was the exchange rate of the British pound against the euro reported by the European

34


-----

Central Bank on March 31, 2019). The Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility was fully utilized as of the
date of this offering memorandum. For more details about the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, see
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility’’.

Prior to our refinancing in 2015, we were not permitted under our former financing arrangements to hedge
for currency risks. As a result, fluctuations in the value of local currencies against the euro have had, and
may have in the future, a significant effect on our operations and on our reported results in euro and the
comparability of our performance between financial periods can be significantly affected by fluctuations in
local currencies against the euro. We have since started to implement foreign currency risk management in
order to monitor our foreign currency risk and to enable us to consider taking action if we decide to do so,
but there is no assurance that any such foreign currency risk management will be effective. As a result,
fluctuations in the value of these local currencies against the euro may have a significant adverse effect on
our operations and on our reported results in euro.

The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar is also important for the European containerboard
industry, because exports from the European market influence the balance of supply and demand and the
price development of containerboard in Europe. Movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rate may also
have an effect on trading. A weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has historically resulted in lower
(U.S. dollar-denominated) exports by European containerboard manufacturers with a negative (for our
business) effect on the supply demand balance and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in
Europe. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also resulted in lower sales
by other European manufacturers who ship products in corrugated packaging, resulting in lower European
demand for corrugated packaging, and therefore for our containerboard and corrugated board. A weak
U.S. dollar may also result in additional competition in the European market from U.S. manufacturers that
have an incentive to sell more products in Europe, due to increased European demand for the relatively
lower-priced U.S. goods over higher-priced European goods.

**The success of our business relies on certain key personnel (in particular, our chief executive officer J¨urgen**
**Heindl), and our ability to attract and retain key personnel, other qualified management personnel and**
**skilled workers.**

The success of our business relies to a considerable extent on the efforts, abilities and reputation of our
executive board and our senior management team, especially our chief executive officer, J¨urgen Heindl.
Mr. Heindl has been responsible to a significant extent for our historical growth and strategic
development. The loss of Mr. Heindl or other key personnel could significantly disrupt our business and
have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. Further, if
we lost any of our key personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully find a
suitable replacement in a timely manner, or at all. We currently expect J¨urgen Heindl to step down from
his role as chief executive officer at the end of 2022, to be succeeded by his son, and our current chief
development officer, Maximilian Heindl.

In addition, the success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management
personnel and skilled workers in the long-term. We compete with a large number of other companies when
recruiting qualified employees. There is an increasing shortage of qualified personnel in the markets in
which we operate, especially personnel with technical, IT or engineering skills. If we are unable to continue
to attract and/or train qualified employees sufficiently and to retain those employees, this could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also ‘‘—Our
_ability to successfully operate the CHP depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel’’._

**Failure to maintain good employee relations may affect our operations and the success of our business.**

Future developments in relation to our business or otherwise could adversely affect relations with our
employees and their works councils. Labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages could lead to a substantial
interruption to our business operations or otherwise adversely affect the Group and have a material
adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

**We may be adversely affected by increasing costs in maintaining our required level of workforce.**

During 2018, we had an average of 1,096 employees (excluding trainees) and personnel expenses constitute
a significant proportion of our cost base. Accordingly, inflationary pressures, changes in applicable laws
and regulations or other factors resulting in increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on
our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and the cost of**
**compliance or the failure to comply with, and any liabilities under, current and future laws and regulations**
**may negatively affect our business.**

We are subject to a wide range of international, national, state and local environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including those governing the discharge of
pollutants into the air and water, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the
clean-up of contaminated properties. We could incur significant costs, including fines, penalties, civil and
criminal sanctions, investigation and clean-up costs, third-party claims for property damage or personal
injury or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or
requiring corrective measures, the installation of pollution control equipment or other mandated actions,
as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or
otherwise.

These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change and have tended to become more stringent
over time. There can be no assurance that the costs of complying with such laws and regulations, or future
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, will not increase. Such cost increases could have a
negative impact on the results of our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

There can be no assurance that we will be at all times in compliance with applicable environmental and
health and safety requirements, which may lead to the incurrence of material costs or liabilities in the
future or impede our ability to obtain and maintain all licenses, consents or other permits necessary to
operate our business. Similarly, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an environmental
spill or accident or discover or otherwise become liable for environmental contamination in the future. We
may incur significant expenditure in connection with the required remediation of past environmental
conditions at both currently-owned and formerly-owned facilities. For example, the land on which we have
constructed our newest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom is a
legacy industrial site with known asbestos contamination which required environmental remediation.
There can be no assurance that the contractually agreed remediation measures that were undertaken by
the seller of the land have been successful and sufficient and that those remediation efforts, together with
relevant environmental insurance policies, will fully protect us from having to incur any future
expenditures in connection with further required remediation.

There can be no assurance that environmental pressure groups and similar organizations will not mount
campaigns against us which, were they to occur, could have an adverse effect on our reputation.

**Failure to maintain good health and safety practices may have an adverse effect on our business.**

Our employees carry out relatively difficult and specialized tasks, and a serious incident affecting the
health and safety of any of our employees could disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our
reputation. We may also be subject to fines or litigation if a health and safety incident occurs. Furthermore,
disruption of operations caused by a major incident could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

**Our licenses may be suspended, amended or terminated prior to the end of their terms or may not be**
**renewed.**

Our licenses and permits required to conduct our business operations, including for the operation of CHP,
could be revoked, withdrawn or amended by the relevant authorities under certain circumstances. For
example, a license or permit could be revoked, withdrawn or amended if there is a subsequent change of
facts or a relevant regulation, such permit is found to be contrary to the public interest, or it is deemed
necessary to prevent severe harm to the common good.

Moreover, private individuals and the public have the right to comment upon the process, raise objections
to proposed permits and initiate court proceedings to intervene and prevent the granting of requested
permits. In addition, environmental organizations, residents or other third parties may raise objections to
our current or proposed activities or file suits challenging our operations and the granting or existence of
permits and licenses to conduct our operations.

The permitting rules are complex and may change over time, making our ability to comply with the
applicable requirements more difficult or even impossible, thereby precluding continuing or future
operations. Regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit

36


-----

issuance. Requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time-consuming and may result in
delays in the continuation of our operations.

If any of our licenses or permits is revoked, withdrawn or amended, or if we have difficulty renewing a
license or permit, we may experience delays in our operations which could adversely impact our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**We are exposed to the particular risks related to our increasingly international operations.**

Our operations have become increasingly international. In addition to our home market, Germany, we
currently operate facilities in the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. As a
result, we are vulnerable to risks in these countries and to the particular risks inherent in international
operations, including:

   - increased difficulties in the collection of accounts receivable, including longer collection periods;

  - inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in legislation or regulatory requirements and
increased difficulty and expense in hiring and dismissing employees; work stoppages, transport
interruptions and difficulties in managing international operations;

   - adverse tax consequences, including as a result of complex transfer pricing regulations; and

   - adverse currency fluctuations or restrictions on the transfer of cash.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
due to the related delays or increased costs in the production and delivery of products and services.

**We are subject to antitrust and similar legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate.**

We are subject to a variety of antitrust and similar legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In
Germany as well as in some of our other markets, we have a market position that may make potential
future acquisitions difficult and may limit our ability to expand by acquisition or merger, if we wished to do
so.

In addition, we are subject to legislation in all the jurisdictions in which we operate relating to unfair
competitive practices and similar behavior, both on an EU level and on a national level. There can be no
assurance that we will not be subject to allegations of, or regulatory investigations or proceedings into, such
practices or behavior. In the event that such allegations are made or investigations or proceedings are
initiated (irrespective of merit), we may be required to devote significant management resources to our
defense against such allegations. In the event that such allegations are proved, we may be subject to
significant fines, damages awards and other expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Our results may be adversely affected if we are unable to implement our strategy to optimize utilization of**
**assets.**

Our results of operations are materially influenced by the degree to which we are able to optimize the
utilization of our assets in order to achieve the necessary production volumes to achieve our business plans.
We cannot guarantee that we will be able to optimize the utilization of assets in accordance with our plans,
or at all, due to, among other things, unforeseen disruptions which are beyond our control. For example,
we continuously work to further optimize production of our paper machines PM1 and PM2. If we are not
able to optimize the usage of our two paper mills and other production facilities, the expected return on
our related investments may not be realized. Any other inability to optimize and sustain the capacity
utilization of our production facilities or achieve cost efficiencies through improvements in production
processes may have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial
condition.

**Our business operations are capital intensive, and we may be required to make significant capital**
**expenditures to maintain our competitive position.**

The operation and expansion of our business requires substantial capital expenditures. In addition to our
significant investment in PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, primarily between 2008 and 2010, we have ongoing
capital expenditure requirements relating to, among other things, the modernization and maintenance of
our existing production plants. Furthermore, we have incurred (and expect to continue to incur) significant

37


-----

capital expenditures in connection with the launch and ramp-up of our corrugated board production sites
in Trzcinica, Poland (PW10), Drizzona, Italy (PW11), and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW12), and
the ongoing establishment of our proposed corrugated board sites in Eisfeld, Germany (PW13) and our
proposed further corrugated board ‘‘mega-plant’’ (PW14) as described above. In the short-term to
mid-term, we intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated
board production capacity, and we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board
production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of
2019 or the first quarter of 2020) and currently expect to establish up to three further corrugated board
production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023, including a further proposed corrugated board
‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early 2021). We
currently expect to make total net investments (i.e. net of expected subsidies) of approximately A60 million
and A70-75 million, respectively, for these two additional corrugated board production sites (PW13 and
PW14). In addition, we have also begun to actively pursue the realization of a further paper machine
project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. We currently expect total net investment costs (i.e. net of
expected subsidies) of approximately A465 million for just this paper machine project over a several year
period, approximately A116.7 million of initial expenditures (e.g. for advance payments for the paper
machine and certain preliminary work) we had already incurred as of the end of the first quarter of 2019.
For further details on our proposed expansion projects and investment program, see ‘‘Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors affecting our Results_
_of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’._

Our ability to expand our business and fund our ongoing operations depends on our ability to generate
cash and access financing. In addition, our liquidity and capital requirements may increase if we decide to
pursue further expansion projects or if we make future acquisitions. We may not generate sufficient cash
flow or have access to sufficient funding to meet these requirements.

Further, we may require information technology enhancements in order to continue providing high-quality
IT support for our production processes. Failure to implement such enhancements may result in reduced
quality of processes and loss of orders and customers. If one or more of the aforementioned risks were to
materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

Furthermore, even successful expansion (or acquisition) projects can have a negative impact on our
profitability in the short-term. For example, our reduced profitability between 2009 and 2010 following the
global financial and economic crisis coincided with the launch of production at our corrugated board
production sites in Strykow, Poland (PW7) and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW8) and at our paper
mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany (PM2), which involved significant start-up and ramp-up costs. The
related costs were largely expected and are normal in our industry, but their timing further exacerbated our
financial condition. In addition, even in a positive market environment, it typically takes two to three years
from the launch of a new corrugated board production site until the production site is fully utilized. For
example, we launched our corrugated board production site in Strykow, Poland (PW7) in 2009, but the site
only completed its ramp-up phase in 2012 and therefore, did not operate at a three-shift capacity for an
entire year until 2013. Our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany commenced
production in October 2015 and completed its ramp-up phase in 2017, while our corrugated board
production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland completed a very fast and successful ramp-up and will likely
already operate at a full, three-shift capacity for an entire year for the first time in 2018. Our corrugated
board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy commenced production in March 2018 and we expect the
ramp up of production to continue through the end of 2020. We expect our newest corrugated board
‘‘mega-plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (which commenced production in January
2019), our proposed new corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany and our proposed
further corrugated board ‘‘mega-plant’’ (PW14) described above to also undergo ramp-up phases of
different durations with a corresponding impact on our result of operations. The start-up and ramp-up
costs and short-term to mid-term impact on our profitability of our latest paper machine project (PM3) will
be proportionately higher, due to the much larger size, higher level of complexity and longer
implementation timeframe of such a project, compared to the establishment of a new corrugated board
production site. For our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2), for example, we executed some of the
definitive agreements with our main project partners (including the related financing arrangements) as
early as the summer of 2008, before starting initial ground works later that year. In addition, even though
our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2) commenced operations in March 2010, it only completed its
initial ramp-up phase in 2013. Since then, we have been continuing our efforts to further optimize our

38


-----

operations at our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, which involves not only the optimization of the performance of
PM2, but also the optimization of connected processes, including the operation of the CHP we acquired
from EnBW effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015. See also ‘‘—The successful implementation of
_our proposed new paper machine project (PM3) poses significant challenges.’’_

**The availability of, or any significant increase in, the cost of transportation represents a significant risk for**
**our business.**

Transportation plays an important part in our supply chain as we transport a majority of our products,
mainly by truck and to a lesser extent by rail or ship, to our customers. Deliveries are generally made as full
truck loads. In addition, most of the raw materials need to be transported to our production facilities and
we also transport large rolls of containerboard from our two paper mills in Burg and Eisenh¨uttenstadt
(both Germany) to our ten other corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic, France,
Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom. We meet our freight and logistics requirements mainly
through the use of external logistics companies and, to a much lesser extent, our own fleet of currently 59
trucks through which we carry out approximately 6.8% of our total transportation requirements. Due to
the relatively large size and weight of our products compared to value, freight and logistics expenses play
an important role in our business, and fluctuations in freight prices can have a significant impact on our
profitability. In 2018, our freight expenses, which include freight for deliveries from our production plants
or other stocks to customers as well as containerboard shipments from our two mills to our various
corrugated board plants, amounted to a total of 67.0 million, or 6.9%, of our sales.

Any material disruption in or lack of availability of transportation or significant increases in fuel or energy
prices, road tolls or demand driven market prices resulting in higher transportation costs, may have a
material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
increased costs relating to vehicle emissions control requirements that have been or may be imposed in the
future, particularly due to climate change related legislation, may also lead to such effects on our margins
and results of operations and financial condition.

**We depend on the uninterrupted operations of our information and communication technology.**

The operation of our production plants and our sales and service activities depend on the uninterrupted
operation of complex and sophisticated computer, telecommunication and data processing systems.
Between each step along our internal value chain and our production processes, we must coordinate and
monitor complex logistics processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and products. In addition, in
2018, approximately 69% of purchase orders for corrugated board from our Progroup Board customers
were received electronically, and all material core processes, which must be coordinated to ensure the
smooth and efficient operation of our production processes, are controlled by our proprietary core ERP
system, WEPAFORM. WEPAFORM implements our internal know-how in the form of best practices and
rules of conduct. The functionality of WEPAFORM covers all our core processes, including order
processing, raw material planning, production planning, production control as well as warehousing,
shipment and invoicing. See also ‘‘Business—Information Technology and Process Management’’.

Computer and data processing systems and related information technology infrastructure (data center,
hardware and wide and local area networks) are generally exposed to the risk of disturbances, damage,
electricity failures, computer viruses, fire, other disasters, hacker attacks, unauthorized or improper access
or abuse by employees and similar events. In addition, we rely on a small number of key employees within
our IT department who are familiar with WEPAFORM and have been involved in its development.
Disruptions to operations or interruptions in operations involving key software applications (in particular,
WEPAFORM) and/or our IT hardware have occurred, in individual cases, in the past and may occur in the
future. Although administration and production networks are separated, such disruptions or interruptions
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain our core processes, could lead to production
downtime and result in significant lost sales. Some of the software products we use are hosted by a third
party off site, in which case we depend on the hosting company’s infrastructure, and any interruption,
disruption or security breaches at the hosting company’s data center may have an adverse effect on our
operations. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

39


-----

**We are subject to risks from legal proceedings.**

We are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business and could become involved in additional
legal and arbitration disputes in the future, which may involve substantial claims for damages or other
payments. The outcome of pending or potential future proceedings is difficult to predict with any certainty.
In the event of a negative outcome of any material legal or arbitration proceeding, whether based on a
judgment or a settlement agreement, we could be obligated to make substantial payments. In addition, the
costs related to litigation and arbitration proceedings may be significant. The realization of any of these
risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the risks we may face and if we were no longer**
**covered by our existing insurance, it may be difficult to obtain replacement insurance on acceptable terms**
**or at all.**

Although we maintain insurance policies, including fire, explosion, radiation, electrical damage, machinery
breakdown, fuel or power shortages, third party liability insurance, transport insurance, computer
insurance and directors’ and officers’ insurance, not all risks are insured or insurable (and may have
significant deductibles on policies). Accordingly, our insurance policies do not provide coverage for all
losses related to our business, and the occurrence of losses, liabilities or damage not covered by such
insurance policies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Due to variable insurance market conditions, there can be no assurance that the insurance that we carry
will continue to be available, will be available at economically acceptable premiums or will be adequate to
cover any resulting liability, and we may be required to enforce insurance coverage or pay high deductibles.
In some cases, coverage is not available or is considered too expensive relative to the perceived risk. If we
experience a loss in the future, the proceeds of the applicable insurance policies, if any, may not be
adequate to cover replacement costs, lost sales, increased expenses and/or liabilities to third parties. This
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

**Our risk management and internal controls may not prevent or detect violations of law.**

Our existing compliance processes and controls may not be sufficient to prevent or detect inadequate
practices, fraud and violations of law by our intermediaries and employees. Due to our business operations
in multiple countries in Europe, we are subject to a number of laws and regulations in various countries.
These include, among others, regulations concerning competition and antitrust law, international trade
and customs, licensing and permits, commercial intellectual property and its enforcement, warranty and
product liability, environmental, building and zoning law, energy law, hazardous substances and chemicals
law, labor and work protection law, tax law and regulations related to purchasing and acquisitions.

In the event that any intermediaries, consultants, sales agents or employees with whom we cooperate either
receive or grant inappropriate benefits or generally use corrupt, fraudulent or other unfair business
practices, we could be confronted with legal sanctions, penalties and loss of orders and harm to our
reputation. Especially given our increasingly international profile, the size and the extent of our
cooperation with intermediaries, consultants, sales agents and employees, our internal controls and
procedures, policies and our risk management may not be adequate to identify or prevent such practices,
which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

**We may have to repay investment grants and subsidies, or previously awarded investment grants may not be**
**disbursed in part or at all.**

A part of our investment requirements for developing and expanding our production capacity is covered by
public aid, such as investment grants, subsidies, loans at favorable conditions or tax reductions or
exemptions, both in Germany and abroad. The decisions on granting public aid received by us contain
various conditions such as regarding the use of funds for certain energy efficiency measures, the creation of
jobs, the total investment amount or the duration of our investment. If these conditions are not fulfilled
during the commitment period, which generally exceeds the specified investment period, this could result
in a repayment claim by the relevant authorities for the public aid received by us. During the commitment
period, such conditions may no longer be satisfied and we could be subsequently exposed to considerable
repayment and interest claims. This could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

40

**Pending and future tax audits within our Group and changes in fiscal regulations could lead to additional**
**tax liabilities.**

We are subject to routine tax audits by local tax authorities. Tax audits in Germany for the Group for
corporate income tax (K¨orperschaftsteuer), trade tax (Gewerbesteuer) and VAT (Umsatzsteuer) relating to
the years 2016 and 2017 are currently ongoing. There can be no guarantee that these tax audits will not
result in any materially higher tax assessments.

Tax audits for later periods not yet subject to a tax audit or tax audits in other countries may lead to higher
tax assessments in the future. For example, we operate a number of tax groups (Organschaften) in
Germany and we are therefore exposed to the risk of a challenge of the existence and due operation of tax
groups in the course of future tax audits. A non-recognition of our tax groups could lead to additional tax
liabilities. The same could apply if we do not comply with our tax reporting obligations.

Any additional tax payments could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations
and financial condition. In addition, changes in fiscal regulations or the interpretation of tax laws by the
courts or the tax authorities may also have a material adverse effect on our business.

**The international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure may expose us to**
**potentially adverse tax consequences.**

We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the
international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to
intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies pursuant to,
for example, purchase agreements or other arrangements. Adverse developments in these laws or
regulations, or any change in position by the relevant authority regarding the application, administration or
interpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction may disagree with the positions we have taken
or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, including the
tax treatment or characterization of our indebtedness, including the Additional Notes and the Existing
Notes, payments or other distributions to our shareholders, existing and future intercompany loans and
guarantees or the deduction of interest expenses. We could also fail, whether inadvertently or through
reasons beyond our control, to comply with tax laws and regulations relating to the tax treatment of various
of our financing arrangements, which could result in unfavorable tax treatment for such arrangements. If
any applicable tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of
our intercompany loans or transactions, it could result in the disallowance of deductions, a limitation on
our ability to deduct interest expenses, the imposition of withholding taxes, the application of significant
penalties and accrued interest on intercompany loans or internal deemed transfers, the application of
significant penalties and accrued interest or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Due to restrictions of the deduction of interest expenses or forfeiture of interest carry forwards under**
**German tax laws, we may be unable to fully deduct interest expenses on our financial liabilities.**

Interest payments on the Additional Notes, the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,
the Senior Secured Facilities and on our other debt may not be fully deductible for tax purposes, which
could adversely affect our financial results. Subject to certain prerequisites, the German interest barrier
rules (Zinsschranke) impose certain restrictions on the deductibility of interest for tax purposes. Since
2008, the German interest barrier rules in general have disallowed the deduction of net interest expenses
exceeding 30% of tax adjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all businesses belonging
to the same tax group (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax purposes, _i.e., the Issuer and_
certain Guarantors, are treated as one single business. Such consolidation is, _inter alia, relevant for the_
calculation of the tax adjusted EBITDA.

There are certain exemptions from the restrictions of the German interest barrier rules allowing for a tax
deduction of the entire annual interest expenses, which, however, may not be available to the Issuer. To the
extent our net interest expenses exceed 30% of our tax adjusted EBITDA in any given year, we may
therefore not be able to deduct the excess in our net interest expense in calculating our taxable earnings
for the relevant year. This may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition and on our
ability to meet our obligations under the Additional Notes and the Guarantees.

41


-----

Any non-deductible amount of interest expenses exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and
may, subject to the interest barrier rules, be deductible in future fiscal years. In the past, our interest
expenses were not entirely deductible. Accordingly, we used to have an interest carry forward (Zinsvortrag)
from previous years. In the meantime all interest carry forwards have been used until December 31, 2018.
Any future interest carry forwards could be forfeited in part or in full in connection with certain measures,
such as a change of our ownership structure.

**If the European Monetary Union ceases to exist or one or more countries leave the European Monetary**
**Union, our margins and results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.**

In recent years, economic events affecting the European economies have raised a number of questions
regarding the overall stability of the European Monetary Union. Despite measures taken by countries in
the European Monetary Union and the European Central Bank to alleviate credit risk, concerns persist
with respect to the ability of certain European Monetary Union countries to meet future financial
obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the
diverse economic and political circumstances in individual European Monetary Union member states. The
economic outlook is adversely affected by the risk that one or more European Monetary Union countries
could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Monetary Union, or that the euro could cease
to be the single currency of the European Monetary Union. The legal and contractual consequences of
such a development for the business of the Group and for holders of the Notes, would be determined by
applicable laws in effect at such time. Any of these developments, or a perception that any of these
developments may be likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the economic development of
the affected countries or lead to economic recession or depression that could jeopardize the stability of
financial markets or the overall financial and monetary system. This, in turn, may have a material adverse
effect on our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**The result of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on our**
**business.**

The United Kingdom’s initiation of the process to withdraw from the European Union pursuant to
Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union following the national referendum in June 2016 (‘‘Brexit’’),
has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom, one of our
current markets, and the EU and its remaining member states, which may constitute an additional risk for
the financial markets and the European economy. Further, as the negotiation process for the exit is still
ongoing, there is a great amount of uncertainty on the specific terms to be agreed between the negotiating
parties. The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union will take effect on the effective date
of the withdrawal agreement, or, unless a further extension is granted, on October 31, 2019 if no
agreement is reached by then. The effects of Brexit are uncertain, and Brexit has and may continue to
contribute to volatility in the prices of securities of companies located in Europe. An extension of the
October 31, 2019 deadline, a second referendum or other developments may result in additional volatility
in the financial markets and the European economy. The overall impact of Brexit, especially without a
withdrawal agreement, may create further global economic uncertainty. A downturn in the European
economy could have adverse effects on our business in the markets in which we operate. In addition, with
the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom,
we have substantially increased our presence in the United Kingdom (a market in which we have
historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins), which has increased our exposure to
any negative outcomes of Brexit. In 2018 and the first three months of 2019, sales in the United Kingdom
accounted for 7.5% and 7.0%, respectively, of our sales by volume. Possible negative outcomes resulting
from Brexit include: significantly disrupted trade between the United Kingdom and the EU; political and
economic instability in other countries of the EU, which covers the majority of our markets; and instability
in the global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the euro and the
pound sterling. The depreciation of the pound sterling against the euro has caused, and may continue to
cause, an increase in the price of goods in the United Kingdom that are sourced from the EU. Therefore,
Brexit might also affect our ability to maintain the current level of sales, as expressed in euros, in the
United Kingdom. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal
implications Brexit will have and whether, and to what extent, our business might be affected. Therefore,
Brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**The interests of our controlling shareholder may be inconsistent with our interests and/or the interests of**
**holders of the Notes.**

J¨urgen Heindl, our chief executive officer and founding shareholder, controls JH-Holding, our controlling
shareholder. The interests of our controlling shareholder, in certain circumstances, may conflict with our
interests or with your interests as holders of the Notes. Mr. Heindl has, directly or indirectly, the power,
among other things, to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, the payment of
dividends, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions as well as the ability to elect and change
our management and to approve any other changes to our operations. The interests of our controlling
shareholder could conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial
difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due, including under the Notes. Mr. Heindl and our
controlling shareholder could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures,
financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their
investments although such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes.

**The information available to market analysts varies in its degree of comparability.**

This offering memorandum contains information regarding market positions, market shares, growth rates
and other industry data pertaining to our business drawn from reports and other materials compiled by
independent professional organizations and analysts. This includes reports prepared by RISI and Vision
Hunters. The analysts compiling these reports base their estimates and conclusions on a variety of sources,
some of which may be more comparable than others. These sources may include:

   - official information published by government agencies,

   - reports published by exchange listed companies with public reporting obligations,

   - information offered voluntarily by privately held companies, and

   - analysts’ own estimates based on information obtained in conversations with competitors, suppliers,
customers and other market participants.

Although our industry uses these reports as a standard source of market data, we cannot determine the
level of reliability and comparability of the data in the reports. The analysts’ estimates and conclusions can
vary, and have in the past varied, materially from the true figures and as a result their reports can under or
overstate market size, market share, growth rates and other important industry data. Accordingly, you
should use caution in using these estimates and any information regarding market position or shares
contained in this offering memorandum and you should not place undue reliance on such estimates or
information.

**We may not be successful in operating the CHP ourselves in the long-run.**

Under the former contracting arrangement with EnBW, we were already closely involved in the operation
of the CHP and already bore a significant portion of the economic risks associated with the operation of
the CHP. However, we did not have any experience operating the CHP ourselves when we started to do so
in 2016. Upon completion of the CHP Acquisition, effective as of December 31, 2015, we were directly
responsible for a number of aspects of the operation of the CHP that were previously performed by EnBW,
and we are now bearing certain additional risks associated with the ownership and operation of the CHP
that were previously being borne by EnBW. In particular, we became directly responsible for, and will bear
all risks related to, the ownership and day-to-day operation of the CHP, which includes the risk of any
further unexpected repair and maintenance costs, the risk of any further significant unscheduled or longer
than scheduled shutdowns of the CHP, the operational risks associated with the disposal of the ash
generated by the CHP (i.e., that we are unable to procure the proper disposal of the ash and may therefore
be forced to shut down the CHP) as well as certain other operational and regulatory risks. See also ‘‘—We
_could be exposed to risks related to the CHP which have not been detected during the due diligence process_
_preceding the CHP Acquisition’’ and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—The CHP Acquisition’’._

**Our ability to successfully operate the CHP depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced**
**personnel.**

Our ability to successfully operate the CHP depends, in part, on certain key personnel and on our ability to
attract and retain a highly skilled workforce for the management and operation of the CHP over the long
term. Such employees with appropriate knowledge and experience are scarce, and the employment market
for such personnel is very competitive. As a result, we might not be able to retain key CHP employees with
specialized knowledge or to attract and retain a highly-skilled workforce for the CHP. Any of these factors
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes.

**The CHP employees are represented by a works council and wage discussions between us and**
**representatives of the CHP employees may result in increased personnel expenses in the future.**

Other than our other employees in Germany, the CHP employees are represented by a works council
(Betriebsrat). Future wage negotiations may result in higher personnel expenses for the operation of the
CHP compared to the historical personnel expenses for the CHP employees.

**We could be exposed to risks related to the CHP which have not been detected during the due diligence**
**process preceding the CHP Acquisition.**

The operation of the CHP may be subject to risks or problems that we may not be aware of, which may not
have been detected or which have not been disclosed to us in the due diligence process or derived from the
financial information of Progroup Power 1 GmbH and that may only emerge over time as we continue to
operate the CHP ourselves. The CHP purchase agreement provides us with limited protection against the
existence of such problems or the materialization of any such risks. The existence of any such risks or
problems could lead to significant additional costs in operating the CHP, require us to incur significant
costs for repairs or to make significant additional investments into the CHP in an attempt to remedy such
risks or problems. For example, in connection with a scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the
third quarter of 2016, we discovered certain technical faults within the CHP that we were not previously
aware of. Because of our long-term economic interest in the efficient and uninterrupted (except for
necessary maintenance shutdowns we schedule on a regular basis) operation of the CHP, we decided to
significantly extend the originally scheduled maintenance shutdown period to allow us to make certain
repairs and replace certain faulty components. This decision led to a significantly longer than scheduled
maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and caused us to incur
A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’, including A13.9 million in additional costs as
expenditure of exceptional size or incidence and A2.1 million in lost sales in 2016. We may learn additional
information about the CHP that adversely affects us in the future, such as unknown or contingent
liabilities, technical problems and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws. Any such liabilities or
problems, individually or in the aggregate, could prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from the
CHP Acquisition and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

**Our ability to supply electricity to the public power grid will be dependent upon transmission and**
**distribution systems and our reliance on third parties.**

The sale and supply of electricity produced by the CHP to the public grid is dependent upon the
infrastructure of the local power grid systems. We have no control over the operation of these power grid
systems and we must rely on independent third-party power grid system operators. Different companies
operate the transmission grids and the distribution grids in Germany. The transmission grid in the region
where the CHP is located is operated by E.DIS AG and there are a number of different operators of
distribution grids.

Any failure of such power grid systems or reduction of available capacity, including as a result of grid
congestion, natural disasters, insufficient maintenance or inadequate development, could prevent us from
selling and supplying electricity from the CHP. In Germany, grid congestion has recently caused
operational issues for certain power generation plants, as the increase of co-generation and renewable
energy in Germany that has a priority feed-in right to German power distribution networks has led to a
reduction of available grid capacity for conventional power plants. In addition, as these power grid systems
are operated by independent third parties who will not be our contractual partners, we will not carry
insurance in this regard which would compensate us in the event of an operational failure. Additionally,
under the German Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz—EnWG), network operators are
responsible for the security and reliability of the power supply system and required to balance differences
between generation and consumption. Therefore, if the safety or reliability of the transmission system is
endangered, particularly in the case of grid bottlenecks, network operators are required to take remedial
grid-related or market-related action, including changes to current electricity feed-in, transit and output. In
doing so, under the EnWG and the German Renewable Energies Act _(Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz—_
EEG), network operators may choose to disconnect power plants from the grid temporarily to reduce or
prevent congestion. In any such case, conventional power plants would be the first to be disconnected,
followed by co-generation plants and renewable power plants. We would not be entitled to compensation
by the network operator for the losses incurred as a consequence of such measures. Due to the nuclear
power phase-out and as renewable power generation and cogeneration increases rapidly in Germany and

44


-----

the capacity of affected transmission and distribution grids is often not expanded sufficiently to
accommodate this increase, there is an increasing risk of grid congestion and subsequent regulation of
feed-in power capacity of conventional power plants during certain hours.

Any failure of the power grids or a disconnection of the CHP from the power grid, e.g., due to congestion
and respective measures by the network operator, could negatively impact our electricity sales, and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**As a result of the CHP Acquisition, we are directly subject to a wide range of laws and regulations**
**specifically governing the German energy sector and the disposal of waste, which are subject to constant**
**change.**

As a result of the CHP Acquisition, we are directly subject to a wide range of laws and regulations
specifically governing the German energy sector and the disposal of waste. See ‘‘Business—Regulatory
_Environment—Regulation governing the Operation of the CHP’’._

The operating costs and results of operations of Progroup Power 1 GmbH and the CHP will be
significantly impacted by the relevant regulatory framework for the electricity sector both on the European
and the national level. In the past years, this regulatory framework has been subject to substantial change
and it will continue to be subject to change in the future. Such change is not only due to legislative reforms,
but is also prompted by administrative and judicial decisions. See also ‘‘—Our energy costs, in particular in
_Germany, are dependent on the regulatory framework for the electricity sector, which is subject to constant_
_change and, in addition, we may face material cost increases if we lose certain financial privileges which we_
_benefit from in Germany with regard to the Renewable Energies Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’)_
_surcharge and network access fees and other fees’’._

Any such changes, in particular any loss or significant reduction of certain financial privileges we currently
enjoy under the German Renewable Energies Act or the German Ordinance on Electricity Network
Access Fees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. As another example, the fluidized bed boiler (Wirbelschichtkessel) of the CHP for the
thermal utilization of refuse-derived fuels currently benefits from an exemption under the CO2 emissions
trading scheme under the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act _(Treibhausgas-_
_Emissionshandelsgesetz, ‘‘TEHG’’). A partial or outright loss of this exemption, as a result of either the_
CHP Acquisition or legal changes in the future, would result in significant additional administrative
expenses as well as costs for purchasing CO2 emission certificates. Any further tightening of general
emission limits under relevant EU or German laws and regulations may require us to incur significant
capital expenditure and ensure continued compliance by the CHP with all relevant laws and regulations.
Since the CHP primarily uses refuse-derived fuels (including processed household and commercial waste),
the operation of the CHP is particularly tightly regulated and is subject to a high level of regulatory
scrutiny. Any breach of emissions limits under applicable laws and regulations, for example, due to
equipment malfunction or a failure of the procedures for screening the waste before it is being incinerated,
may force us to temporarily shut down the CHP or cause the relevant regulators to impose administrative
sanctions and/or modify the operating permits for the CHP, which could result in significant costs.

In addition, the reduction or elimination of certain energy-related tax credits and exemptions or other
changes in tax laws, in particular under the German Electricity Tax Act (Stromsteuergesetz—StromStG) and
the German Energy Tax Act (Energiesteuergesetz—Energie StG), could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, we may be adversely
affected by any regulatory changes that may favor recycling over the thermal utilization of the refusederived fuels used in the operation of the CHP. For example, certain counties (Landkreise) in which one of
our suppliers of refuse-derived fuels operates have recently adopted a new scheme for the collection of
certain recyclables and organic waste. As a result of this change, other regulatory changes or similar
developments in other regions, the amount and quality of household waste our supplier will be able to
collect will likely decrease which will make it more difficult for our supplier to supply us with the agreed
amount of refuse-derived fuels under the supply agreement, it may become more difficult to obtain the
required quality and/or quantities of refuse-derived fuels to ensure the operation of the CHP in the future
and/or the waste disposal fees we are able to charge for the thermal utilization of the refuse-derived fuels
may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

Furthermore, we are subject to various compliance, reporting and audit requirements under applicable
laws and regulations, which require us to incur additional costs, including for the services of external

45


-----

advisers. Under the German Energy Services Act (EDLG), for example, certain larger companies are
required to carry out an energy audit, unless they have implemented an energy management system
(EnMS). Since the CHP has implemented an EnMS, it is currently exempt from the energy audit
requirement. However, the requirements of the EDLG also apply to current members of the Group and
the Issuer as well as certain of its subsidiaries will still be required to carry out an energy audit under the
EDLG. Failure to comply with these and other requirements and any relevant laws or regulations could
also expose us to fines. See ‘‘Business—Regulatory Environment—Regulation governing the Operation of the
_CHP—Energy Services Act (EDLG)’’._

**RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL POSITION**

**Our debt agreements contain customary financial and restrictive covenants that limit our operating**
**flexibility.**

The Conditions of Issue, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities
and the New Senior Secured Facilities contain, or will contain, covenants significantly restricting our ability
to, among other things:

   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock,

   - create or incur liens,

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity,

   - make certain restricted payments and certain investments or sell or transfer certain assets,

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates or subsidiaries,

  - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the disposal, transfer or lease of assets by subsidiaries,

   - sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries,

   - consolidate or merge with other entities, and

   - impair the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Additional Notes and the Existing
Notes, respectively.

In addition, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant as described under
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility’’.

Any future debt agreements that we enter into may have covenants that are even more restrictive. The
requirement that we comply with these and any future provisions may materially adversely affect our ability
to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be
desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, or withstand a continuing or future
downturn in our business.

**If we are unable to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants included in the Conditions of Issue,**
**the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities, the New Senior Secured**
**Facilities or any future debt agreements, there could be a default under such agreements, which could result**
**in an acceleration of repayment.**

As described in the preceding risk factor, the Conditions of Issue, the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and the New Senior Secured Facilities contain, and any
future debt agreements we enter into may contain, certain financial and restrictive covenants. Our ability
to comply with these covenants, including meeting financial ratios and tests, depends on a number of
factors, some of which may be beyond our control, such as a deterioration of the industry and markets in
which we operate or a deviation from the assumptions contained in our business plan. As a result, we may
be unable to comply with our financial and restrictive covenants, and any failure may materially adversely
affect our margins and results of operations and financial condition.

The breach of a financial or other covenant or our failure to meet any of our obligations under any of the
agreements governing our debt may result in a default under such agreements, which in turn could result in
a number of adverse consequences including, prohibiting us from drawing additional funds under credit
facilities, significant increases in interest rates and other financing costs, the acceleration of all outstanding
amounts under such agreements requiring us to immediately repay the related debt in whole or in part,

46


-----

and/or the commencement of foreclosure or other enforcement actions against any of our assets securing
such debt. In addition, any default may expose us to requests by our suppliers for advance payments for
deliveries and a reduction or cancellation by credit insurers of their commitments. Defaults may also
trigger cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses contained in our other debt agreements, including the
Conditions of Issue, and our liquid funds and short-term cash flow may be insufficient to service any of the
debts in the circumstances described above. Accordingly, any failure by us to service our debts may have a
materially adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Additional Notes and
the Guarantees.

**Our substantial leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our business.**

As we execute our various ongoing and proposed expansion projects and utilize the available facilities
under our various financing arrangements, including under Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB
Facilities, Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, Facility A of the Senior Secured Commerzbank
Facilities, the Senior Secured HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Facilities, we expect our
indebtedness to increase significantly over the next few years, and we have, and expect to continue to have,
increasingly significant debt service obligations. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements’’,
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’ and ‘‘Summary
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information’’. We further have the ability to borrow an additional_
A50 million under our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2019, after giving pro forma
effect to the Offering and the redemption of the Floating Rate Notes as described under ‘‘Use of
_Proceeds’’, we would have had pro forma senior secured net debt of A569.0 million and a pro forma senior_
secured net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.1x.

The expected increase in our leverage could have important consequences to the Holders, including:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Additional Notes and
our other debt and liabilities;

   - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic
and industry conditions;

   - requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and
development, or other general corporate purposes;

   - restricting us from pursuing acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

   - exposing us to increases in interest rates with respect to our floating rate debt instruments, such as
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, the Existing
Senior Secured HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly
leveraged; and

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, capital expenditures,
business opportunities, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and increasing the cost of
any future borrowings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our margins and
results of operations and financial condition, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to satisfy our obligations, including under the Additional Notes and the Guarantees.

Furthermore, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility and the conditions of issue for the Existing Notes contain, and Conditions of
Issue will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the restrictions are subject to a
number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of
indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition,
under the ‘‘Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ covenant in each of the Conditions of Issue and the Super

47


-----

Senior Revolving Credit Facility we are permitted to make significant dividend payments and other
distributions, which could also increase our leverage. To the extent we become even more leveraged than
anticipated or incur additional obligations, the risks described above will intensify.

**Borrowings under our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, the**
**Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility will bear interest at**
**floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our interest cost and debt and reducing our cash flow.**

A substantial part of our indebtedness, including our borrowings under the Existing Senior GBP Facility
and potential future borrowings under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior
Secured HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, will be at variable rates of
interest, which could rise significantly in the future. Although we may enter into and maintain certain
hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurances that hedging will
continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks including
that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. If
interest rates rise in the future, our interest expense associated with any variable rate obligations that are
not hedged would increase, even though the amounts borrowed would remain the same, reducing cash flow
available to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions and other
general corporate purposes, including satisfying our debt service obligations, including under the
Additional Notes and the Guarantees. Please also see ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk—Interest_
_rate risk’’._

**Changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the EURIBOR, LIBOR, WIBOR, PRIBOR or BUBOR calculation**
**process may adversely affect the interest we pay on our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, our Existing**
**Senior Secured GBP Facility, our Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility and our New Senior Secured Erste**
**Bank Facility.**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at interest rates based on EURIBOR,
LIBOR, WIBOR, PRIBOR or BUBOR, as applicable, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility bear
interest at interest rates based on LIBOR and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility and the New
Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility will bear interest rates based on EURIBOR.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number
of governments and the European Union have been conducting investigations into whether the banks that
contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may
have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR,
EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be
‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the
implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new
European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to
measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the
implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the
result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or
there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK
Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for
the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the ‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA
Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be
guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark,
changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement
agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR, WIBOR, PRIBOR, BUBOR or
LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, the Existing Senior Secured
HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR
and/or EURIBOR). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result
in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR, WIBOR, PRIBOR, BUBOR or LIBOR, which
could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.
To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense could correspondingly
increase, thereby reducing our cash flow.

48


-----

**We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt, and our ability to generate sufficient cash**
**depends on factors that may be beyond our control.**

Our ability to service and refinance our debt and to fund future operations and capital expenditures is
highly dependent on our future operating performance and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow. To a
significant degree, our future operating performance and ability to generate cash flows is, in turn,
dependent on various general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other
factors which are outside our control. Due to any of these factors, we may be unable to generate sufficient
cash flows from our operating activities, anticipated sales growth, cost saving or operational efficiency
improvements, and any future debt or equity financing may not be available to us in amounts which would
enable us to pay the principal premium and interest of our indebtedness, including the Notes.

To the extent our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to meet our liquidity needs and service
our debt, we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing. In addition, our subsidiaries may be
restricted in certain jurisdictions within which they operate from paying dividends or making other
distributions to us. If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources are
insufficient to pay our various obligations as they mature or to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, we and
our subsidiaries may be forced, among other things, to reduce or delay business activities and capital
expenditure, sell assets, or forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses. There can be no
assurance that any of these alternatives can be accomplished on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at
all. Further, we may be compelled to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the
Notes, on or before their maturity. We may face the additional risk that in order to refinance our debt, we
could be required to agree to more onerous covenants, which would further restrict our business
operations. The occurrence of any event described above may have a materially adverse effect on our
margins and results of operations and financial condition.

**We may be unable to extend or refinance our debt on favorable terms or at all.**

Amounts outstanding under our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured
Facilities and the New Senior Secured Facilities and other future borrowings must potentially be repaid
before the maturity date of the Notes. Our ability to pay and refinance our debt or our ability to fund our
working capital and capital expenditures is heavily reliant on our future operating performance and our
ability to generate a sufficient cash flow. We may be unable to achieve any refinancing on a timely basis or
on satisfactory terms. We may also be limited in our ability to pursue refinancing alternatives by the terms
and conditions of our existing debt agreements. Our inability to refinance our debt obligations on or prior
to their maturity on favorable terms or at all could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service
and repay the Notes.

**RISKS RELATED TO THE NOTES**

**The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations on**
**the Notes.**

The Issuer is a holding company that has limited business operations of its own. Consequently, payment of
interest and repayment of our indebtedness, including under the Notes, will be dependent on the ability of
our subsidiaries to make such cash available to us, by either dividend distributions or intercompany loans,
or both. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may be restricted by the terms of their existing or future
indebtedness or by law in their ability to, make such dividend distributions or advance upstream loans to
enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each of our subsidiaries is
a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our
ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

While the Conditions of Issue, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured
Facilities and the New Senior Secured Facilities limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur contractual
restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations
are subject to certain significant qualifications and exceptions. We cannot assure you that arrangements
with our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness
of our subsidiaries and our results of operations and cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient
dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes.

49


-----

In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be
unable to make required principal payments on the Notes and interest payments on the Notes. We do not
expect to have any other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to the Holders.

**The Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to additional indebtedness that we may incur**
**to the extent such debt is secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes.**

Although the Conditions of Issue restrict the Issuer’s and its restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pledge any
assets as collateral to secure other debt and require the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure the
Notes equally and ratably if we pledge any assets for the benefit of certain other debt, both the restriction
on pledging assets or incurring liens and the requirement to provide equal security to the Notes are subject
to a number of significant exceptions and carve-outs. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Covenants—Limitation
_on Liens’’. For example, if the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries acquire assets subject to security interests_
securing other indebtedness, such security interests will be permitted to remain in place under the terms of
the Conditions of Issue and will not trigger a requirement to secure the Notes or Guarantees equally and
ratably. To the extent the Issuer or any of its restricted subsidiaries pledges any assets for the benefit of
other debt without also securing the Notes, the Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively subordinated
to such debt to the extent of the value of such assets. As a result of the foregoing, holders of (present or
future) secured debt of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries may recover disproportionately more on
their claims than the Holders in an insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceeding. The Issuer and the
Guarantors may not have sufficient assets remaining to satisfy our obligations under the Notes or the
Guarantees, respectively.

**The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor**
**subsidiaries.**

Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries will not have any
obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose unless they
guarantee the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors
and preference shareholders (if any), will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the
subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by Holders under the
Additional Notes or the Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of the non-guarantor
subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of
their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to its
parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. In
addition, the terms of the Conditions of Issue as well as our other indebtedness allow the non-guarantor
subsidiaries to incur additional debt in the future, which will be structurally senior to the Notes. See
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes’’.

**We are subject to significant restrictive debt covenants under the Conditions of Issue, our Super Senior**
**Revolving Credit Facility, our Existing Senior Secured Facilities and our New Senior Secured Facilities, all**
**of which limit our operating flexibility.**

The Conditions of Issue contain covenants which impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate,
including restrictions on our ability to:

   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

   - create or incur certain liens;

   - pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make other distributions;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt as equity;

   - make certain other restricted payments or restricted investments;

  - enter into agreements that would impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or make other payments to us;

   - transfer or sell assets;

   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

50


-----

   - merge or consolidate with other entities; and

   - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.

These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to
pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest. The Conditions of Issue will
permit us to incur unsecured as well as secured debt in the future, which may be substantial.

In addition, our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, our Existing Senior Secured Facilities and our New
Senior Secured Facilities include covenants that, in general, impose similar, if not tighter, restrictions on
the actions mentioned above. In addition, the covenants under our Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,
our Existing Senior Secured Facilities and our New Senior Secured Facilities impose further restrictions on
the way we can operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

  - purchase Notes in the secondary market;

   - transfer our center of main interest to a jurisdiction outside of Germany; and

  - amend constitutional documents.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility also includes a springing interest coverage ratio covenant,
which requires us to maintain a certain minimum interest coverage ratio (i) at any quarterly testing date
during a time during which the aggregate base currency amount of all utilizations and cash ancillary
outstanding under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be equal to or greater than 40 per cent.
of the total commitments thereunder (a ‘‘Trigger Period’’) or (ii) if a utilization has been requested at any
time where a Trigger Period is continuing or would be caused by the proposed utilization. For a maximum
of four times during the life of the facilities under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, a breach of
this covenant will only constitute a default if it is not complied with in respect of two successive testing
periods. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility’’. Our
ability to meet these financial tests may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may
not be able to meet these tests. Any breach of the interest coverage ratio covenant under the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility could result in a draw-stop under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
and/or an acceleration of that facility, which in turn could, subject to certain threshold amounts being
reached, trigger a cross acceleration of the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities or the New Senior
Secured Facilities.

As a result of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in the instruments discussed above or under
any other outstanding debt instruments, any breach of any covenant under those instruments could result
in all amounts outstanding under any such instrument being accelerated and becoming due and payable.
We may be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances.

**It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral.**

The Collateral will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Conditions of Issue, the terms of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the terms
of the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and the terms of the New Senior Secured Facilities, whether on or
after the date the Additional Notes are first issued. The existence of such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as
the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority
ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including the timely satisfaction of
perfection requirements (including registration requirements), statutory liens or re-characterization under
the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The Collateral may be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security
interests in collateral. For example, because we operate in a market environment subject to production
overcapacity from time to time, it may be difficult for the Security Agent to sell our manufacturing
facilities or other assets in an enforcement scenario. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the
consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Security Agent may not be able to obtain any
such consent. In addition, the consents of any third parties may not be given, when required, to facilitate a
foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon
those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,**
**Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds**
**of the Collateral sold in any enforcement procedure in priority to the Notes.**

From and following the issue date of the Additional Notes, the obligations of the Issuer under the
Additional Notes and the related Guarantees and the New Senior Secured Facilities will be secured on a
first-ranking basis with security interests over Collateral that also secure our obligations under the Existing
Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities, certain Hedging
Obligations and certain Cash Management Liabilities. The Conditions of Issue also permit the Collateral
to be pledged to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor
Agreement. Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the liabilities under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility as well as certain Priority Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Liabilities will
have priority over any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action
taken with respect to the Collateral. As such, in the event of a foreclosure on the Collateral, you may not
be able to recover on the Collateral if the then-outstanding claims under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and such amount in respect of such Priority Hedging Obligations or such Cash Management
Liabilities are greater than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral
by any creditor will, after all obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and such amount
in respect of such certain Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities have been
discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations
secured by the Collateral on an equal basis with the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who also serves as the security agent
in relation to the holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior
Secured Facilities, our hedging obligations, our Cash Management Liabilities and any additional secured
debt permitted to be incurred under the Conditions of Issue, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
and the Senior Secured Facilities, will act only as provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement.

In general, the facility agent under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of the Notes and
the agents under our Senior Secured Facilities and any permitted future senior secured debt, voting as
provided below, will have, subject to certain restrictions, the ability to provide enforcement instructions to
the Security Agent to enforce the shared Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, where
there is an inconsistency between enforcement instructions provided by the holders of 66[2]⁄3% of the
aggregate of all outstanding liabilities under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging
liabilities and cash management liabilities (the ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’) and the holders of
more than 50% of the total ‘‘Majority Pari Passu Creditors’’, being the aggregate of the Notes and all
liabilities outstanding under the Senior Secured Facilities and any other indebtedness sharing the
Collateral on a first-ranking basis, the latter instructions will prevail. However, if and to the extent the
obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and other super senior liabilities have not
been fully discharged within six months of the end of an initial consultation period or no enforcement
action has been taken within three months of such date or an insolvency event (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) occurs, the enforcement instructions provided by the Majority Super Senior
Creditors will prevail. The lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging
counterparties and cash management providers may have interests that are different from the interests of
holders of the Notes, and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue
their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders
of the Notes to do so.

These arrangements could be disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes in a number of other respects.
Other creditors not subject to the Intercreditor Agreement could commence enforcement action against
the Issuer or its subsidiaries during such period, the Issuer or one or more of its subsidiaries could seek
protection under applicable bankruptcy laws, or the value of certain Collateral could otherwise be
impaired or reduced in value.

In addition, in certain circumstances, including acceleration of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility,
the Senior Secured Facilities or the Notes, any amounts recovered from the enforcement of Collateral or
other asset sales will be required to be turned over to the Security Agent. Subject to the prior payment of
fees and expenses of the agent under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Holders’
Representative and Security Agent, the Intercreditor Agreement requires the Security Agent to pay
amounts turned over to it or otherwise received by it in respect of the Notes, such as proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral and other asset sales, to the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving

priority to the holders of the Notes and lenders under our Senior Secured Facilities.

**Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited**
**by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.**

The Guarantee Agreement will provide that each guarantee in relation to each Guarantee and the
Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors and
security providers (including those that relate to general statutory limitations, capital maintenance,
corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, financial assistance or thin-capitalization rules or other similar
laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction). See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests’’._

If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, a Guarantor or security provider may have no
liability or decreased liability under its guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, depending on the amounts of
its other obligations and applicable law.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other
laws, a court could (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s or security provider’s obligations
under its guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, (ii) direct that the recipient returns any amounts paid
under a guarantee, or return any proceeds received in connection with the enforcement of Collateral, to
the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security
provider’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that:

   - the relevant guarantee was incurred, or the relevant Collateral was granted, with actual intent to
give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of
the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of
the guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when
the recipient was aware that the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent when it
granted the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable;

   - the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, did not receive fair consideration or reasonably
equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, and the
Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of
the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized
because of the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed
that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

   - the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, was held to exceed the corporate objects of the
Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate
benefit of the Guarantor or security provider, as applicable; or

  - the amount paid or payable under the relevant guarantee or enforced or to be enforced under the
relevant Collateral, as applicable, was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable
law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee or Collateral granted by any of
our subsidiaries pursuant to the Guarantee Agreement.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security
provider, as applicable, was ‘‘insolvent’’ at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the
valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, was insolvent
on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security
provider, as applicable, was insolvent on the date its guarantee was issued or Collateral was granted, as
applicable, that payments to holders of the Notes, constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances on other grounds.

The liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as applicable, under its guarantee or Collateral, as
applicable, will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, not
constituting a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or otherwise being set aside. However, there
can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum
liability of each Guarantor or security provider, as applicable. There is a possibility that the entire
guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be
extinguished.

53


-----

If a court decided that a guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, was a preference, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance and voided such guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, or held it unenforceable for any other
reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor or security provider, as
applicable, and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor or
security provider under the relevant guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, that has not been declared void.
In the event that any guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part,
or to the extent the agreed limitation of the guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, obligations apply, the
Notes, would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor or security provider,
and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes, or any guarantee or Collateral, as applicable, is
found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you
that we can repay in full the amounts outstanding under the Notes.

See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and Security Interests’’._

**Enforcement of the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult.**

The Collateral will be governed by the laws of multiple jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency
or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights under the
Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of the respective jurisdiction, and it may be difficult to effectively
enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcies, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such
multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in
substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The application of these various
laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could
adversely affect the ability to enforce the security and to realize any recovery under the Notes and the
Guarantees. A summary description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany and certain other
jurisdictions are set out in ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests’’._

**You may be required to pay a cash amount (‘‘soulte’’) in the event you decide to enforce the pledge over**
**securities granted under French law by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of**
**securities rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction.**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due
and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities account may generally be enforced at the
option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the
proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution
_judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors,_
following which the secured creditors become the legal owners of the pledged securities. If the secured
creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual
foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed
securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a
pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure.

If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to
pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so
determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining
amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the
sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not
be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and
controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the
purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. See ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests—_
_France—Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (‘‘soulte’’)’’._

**The insolvency laws of Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom may not be as**
**favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes, from recovering**
**payments due on the Notes.**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic
and the United Kingdom. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom or other relevant jurisdiction.
Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex and more costly for creditors and otherwise may
result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the
Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of
several jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights
in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
jurisdictions of organization or incorporation may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each
other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental
and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application
of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law
should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, and the related
guarantees in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. For example, under English
insolvency law, among other powers, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to
the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or
administrator believes that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at
an undervalue or constituted a preference, each as defined in the relevant insolvency laws and in each case,
where the action took place within a specified time period before the insolvency of the relevant entity.

For more information, regarding insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees
and security interests in the Collateral, see ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests’’._

**Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the**
**Collateral.**

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected in terms of validity, enforceability,
ranking or otherwise with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, the Security Agent or any other third
party, fail or are unable to take the actions (e.g., as for filing, registration, modification or other
requirements) required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the
Holders’ Representative nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to
perfect any of these liens.

**The granting of the security interests in connection with the Notes may fall within the scope of hardening**
**periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees, when issued, may fall within the
scope of hardening periods in accordance with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions. If the security
interest were granted or recreated or were to be enforced during the respective hardening period
applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it.

**Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, collateral granted in favor of holders of the Additional Notes may**
**not rank pari passu with the collateral granted in favor of holders of the Existing Notes, lenders under the**
**Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, lenders under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and creditors of**
**any other indebtedness sharing the Collateral, and we are relying on the Intercreditor Agreement to achieve**
**an equal priority lien in respect of such collateral.**

Under the laws of certain jurisdictions, we will enter into new security documents over the collateral with
respect to the additional debt represented by the Additional Notes. In certain jurisdictions, the security
granted under those additional security documents will, because they are being granted at a later point in
time, rank junior to security interests in the collateral granted in favor of the Existing Notes, the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities and any other indebtedness sharing
the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the benefit of the first and junior ranking
pledges over such collateral be shared equally by the holders of all of the Notes, the lenders under our

55


-----

Senior Secured Facilities, the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging
obligations and cash management liabilities (subject to super senior priority status accorded to certain
liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement). Therefore, the ranking of
collateral granted in favor of holders of the Additional Notes in such jurisdictions will depend on the
enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, if the Intercreditor Agreement is found to be
invalid or unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the collateral
granted in favor of holders of the Additional Notes in these jurisdictions may rank behind any other
existing collateral, including collateral granted in favor of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Facilities.

**The Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral for the benefit of Holders of the Additional Notes**
**will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to you.**

The Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer
under the Additional Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees of the Additional
Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Additional Notes. Instead, they will be granted only
in favor of the Security Agent.

The Conditions of Issue provide that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security
Documents in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Guarantees in
accordance with the terms thereof. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security
interests or Guarantee claims and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes or the Guarantees, except through the Holders’ Representative, who will (on
behalf of the holders of the Notes and subject to the provisions of the Conditions of Issue, the Guarantee
Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral or the Guarantees.

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the Collateral is subject to
mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are
taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged
assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some
uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the
Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a Security Document will be validly secured. In
certain jurisdictions, including, among others, Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing
the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the respective
Collateral will secure a so-called ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligation (the ‘‘Parallel Debt Obligation’’) created under
the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations
under the Notes directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal
requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with
the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may
cause invalidity of the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and
payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the
Guarantees (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will
discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the
corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt,
a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full principal amount of the Notes, the parallel debt
structure has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions, including Germany, and there is no judicial
guidance as to its efficacy or validity. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral
may be restricted, or the parallel debt structure might not be capable of creating a valid security interest on
the part of the Security Agent.

In addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Security Agent which could in particular, under certain circumstances, result in a delay in enforcement,
diminishing value or even loss of the Collateral or Guarantees.

**There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes, under which the Collateral and**
**the Guarantees may be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Holders’**
**Representative.**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released
automatically, including, without limitation, the following:

   - in connection with any sale, exchange or transfer (including by merger or otherwise) of Collateral to
any person other than the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary permitted under, and made in
compliance with, the Conditions of Issue;

  - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes in
accordance with the Conditions of Issue;

  - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee (with respect to the Collateral
granted by such Guarantor);

   - if a restricted subsidiary is designated to be an unrestricted subsidiary, the release of the property,
assets and capital stock of such restricted subsidiary;

  - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or discharge of the Conditions of Issue;

  - as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers’’, ‘‘—Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation’’ and ‘‘—Impairment of Security Interest’’;_

   - if the lien granted in favor of other indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the lien
over such Collateral is released (other than pursuant to the repayment and discharge thereof);

   - in connection with the granting or creation of certain ‘‘Permitted Liens’’, including in connection
with ‘‘Packaging Park Projects’’;

   - with respect to the pledges over the shares in Issuer and any Collateral in respect of receivables of
the Parent against the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, insurance and intra-group receivables, upon
the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all liens
(other than ‘‘Permitted Liens’’) over such Collateral securing indebtedness, so long as no event of
default exists at such time or would arise as a result of such release;

   - with respect to any Collateral (other than pledges over the shares in the Issuer and any Collateral in
respect of receivables of the Parent against the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, insurance and intragroup receivables), upon the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action)
of any and all liens (other than ‘‘Permitted Liens’’) over such Collateral securing indebtedness, so
long as no event of default exists at such time or would arise as a result of such release; provided
that at the time of such release a Rating Triggering Period (as defined in the Conditions of Issue) is
in effect.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Guarantees, may be released automatically, including,
without limitation, the following:

  - upon any sale, exchange or transfer (including by way of consolidation or merger) of ownership
interests in the Guarantor (directly or through a parent company) such that a Guarantor does not
remain a restricted subsidiary, or upon a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of a Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or a restricted subsidiary), in each case, otherwise not
prohibited by the Conditions of Issue;

   - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes, in
accordance with the Conditions of Issue;

   - if a Guarantor is designated to be an unrestricted subsidiary;

  - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Conditions of
Issue;

   - upon the release of any guarantee of indebtedness that resulted in the creation of such guarantee
under the Conditions of Issue, so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing, to the
extent that such Guarantor does not guarantee certain other debt; and

  - as described under ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers’’ and ‘‘—Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation’’._

**We may not be able to repay the Notes, when due or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to do so**
**pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision**
**contained in the Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain**
**important corporate events.**

At final maturity of the Notes, or in the event of acceleration of the Notes, following an event of default
including a cross acceleration event, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes, will become due
and payable. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, holders of
the Notes, may in certain circumstances require the Issuer to make an offer to purchase the Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the purchase date. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders
_upon a Change of Control’’. The Issuer may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for_
additional financing to pay these amounts when they become due.

The Issuer’s failure to repay holders tendering Notes, as applicable, upon the occurrence of a change of
control event would result in an event of default under the Notes. We cannot assure you that we would
have sufficient funds to repay our outstanding indebtedness which we would be required to prepay or offer
to purchase or that became immediately due and payable as a result. We may require additional financing
from third parties to fund any such purchases and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain
financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Restrictions in our other then-existing contractual obligations may
also restrict us from making such required repurchases.

A change of control may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of our then-existing
indebtedness, and the repurchase of the Notes, pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such
indebtedness even if the change of control itself does not. The change of control provision contained in the
Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate
events, including reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may
adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial
ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a ‘‘change of control’’ as defined in the Conditions of
Issue.

The definition of ‘‘change of control’’ contained in the Conditions of Issue includes a disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole. Although there is a
limited body of case law in some jurisdictions interpreting the phrase ‘‘all or substantially all’’, there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under law and there is no German case law interpreting ‘‘all or
substantially all’’ in the context of terms and conditions of high yield notes or other debt instruments.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ the assets of the Issuer and its restricted
subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred
and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**Certain amendments to the Conditions of Issue may be passed with the consent of 90% of less than the**
**majority of the Notes outstanding.**

The Conditions of Issue, may be amended by a vote of the holders of the Notes. Amendments require a
majority of not less than 50.1% of votes cast or, for certain amendments, 90% of the votes cast as opposed
to 50.1% or 90%, respectively, of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding. Certain further
amendments to the Conditions of Issue, require approval of 100% of the holders of the Notes. The voting
process under the Conditions of Issue will be governed in accordance with the German Act on Debt
Securities of 2009 (Gesetz ¨uber Schuldverschreibungen aus Gesamtemissionen, Schuldverschreibungsgesetz,
_SchVG), pursuant to which the quorum for noteholder votes is principally set at a simple majority._
Accordingly, the aggregate principal amount of Notes required to vote in favor of an amendment will vary
based on the noteholder votes participating. For example, if the holders of less than 55.5% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes participate in a vote, any proposed amendment, including amendments
subject to the 90% threshold, can be passed with less than a majority of the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes consenting. See ‘‘Description of the Notes—Amendments and Waivers’’.

**You may be unable to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities laws violations.**

The Issuer is incorporated in Germany. The Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated in the Czech
Republic, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. Each member of our management team and the
directors and executive officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States, and all of our

be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer, a Guarantor

liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States, and there is doubt as to the
enforceability in the home jurisdictions of the other Guarantors of civil liabilities predicated upon the
federal securities laws of the United States, either in original actions or in actions for enforcement of
judgments of U.S. courts. It may also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within
Germany upon the Issuer or the Guarantors or those persons under the Convention on Service Abroad of
Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters and the German law implementing
such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, particularly if
such service violated the German Constitutional Law (Grundgesetz). If a judgment is obtained in a U.S.
court against the Issuer or any Guarantor or a security provider, investors will need to enforce such
judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. As all the assets of the Issuer and the
Guarantors and the assets of its and their directors are located outside of the United States, you may be
unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against us or them. See ‘‘Service of Process and
_Enforcement of Civil Liabilities’’._

**The transferability of the Additional Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws.**

None of the Additional Notes or the Guarantees have been, or will be, registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered
or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any
other jurisdiction. See ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’. It is the obligation of holders of Additional Notes to ensure
that their purchase and any subsequent transfer of the Additional Notes within the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws. Any of these restrictions and requirements will limit the
ability of investors to resell the Additional Notes and the Guarantees.

**The Additional Notes may not be fungible with the Existing Notes for a period of one year after their**
**issuance.**

Any Additional Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S will share the same ISIN and the same common
code as the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Regulation S, and will be fungible with the Existing Notes
issued pursuant to Regulation S as of their issuance.

Any Additional Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A will initially have a separate ISIN and common code
from the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A, until the termination of certain U.S. selling
restrictions one year after the issue date of the Additional Notes. Only after the expiration of this one year
period, the Additional Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A and the Existing notes issued pursuant to
Rule 144A will share the same ISIN and common code as the Existing Notes issued pursuant to
Rule 144A, and will become fungible with the Existing Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A. This may
impact the tradability and price of any Additional Notes issued pursuant to Rule 144A.

**There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Additional**
**Notes may be limited.**

We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market for the Notes, your ability to sell your Additional
Notes, or the prices at which you would be able to sell your Additional Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for
non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in
the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be
adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that
may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any
such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects
and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a
market in the Notes. The Initial Purchasers are not, however, obliged to do so, and they may discontinue
any market-making activities at any time without notice. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be
an active trading market for the Notes, and you may therefore not be able to resell your Additional Notes
at a fair value, if at all.

-----

**The Additional Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of The International Stock**
**Exchange.**

Although the Issuer will, in the Conditions of Issue, agree to use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Additional Notes listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’) within a
reasonable period after the issue date of the Additional Notes and to maintain such listing as long as the
Notes are outstanding, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Additional Notes will become or remain
listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of the Exchange or it becomes unduly
burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing,
provided that it will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another
stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any time, without the consent of the Holders or the
Holders’ Representative, de-list the Notes from any stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing
of the Notes to another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be a stock exchange
that is not regulated by the European Union).

Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Additional Notes as a result of listing on the
Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance
with the Conditions of Issue, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an
alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Additional Notes from the Official List
of the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the Conditions of Issue may have a
material effect on a Holder’s ability to resell the Additional Notes in the secondary market.

**The interests of Holders of the Notes may be inconsistent with those of the lenders under the Super Senior**
**Revolving Credit Facility or the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and our Senior Secured Credit Facilities have different
maturity dates, prepayment schedules and prepayment provisions and will have other features that differ
from the corresponding terms in the Conditions of Issues governing the Notes. As a result of these
differences, the interests of holders of the Notes could conflict with those of the lenders under our Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility and/or the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. For
example, the lenders under one or more of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities may be in a position to
agree to certain amendments that would be beneficial to them but adverse to the economic interest of the
Holder of the Notes.

**Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Additional Notes.**

The Additional Notes offered hereby are denominated and payable in euros. If you measure your
investment returns by reference to a currency other than euros, an investment in the Additional Notes will
entail foreign exchange risks related to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of
the euro relative to the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments
because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro
against the currency by reference to which you measure the return on your investments could cause a
decrease in the effective yield of the Additional Notes below the stated coupon rate and could result in a
loss to you when the return on the Additional Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which
you measure the return on your investments. There may be tax consequences for you as a result of any
foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from an investment in the Additional Notes. See ‘‘Taxation—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations’’._

**Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be**
**subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time.**

The Existing Notes have been assigned credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s
Investor Service, Inc. The credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of
the Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the
Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market,
additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or
withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain
constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a
credit rating agency in the future if in its judgment circumstances so warrant. A suspension, reduction or

60


-----

withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more credit rating agencies may
adversely affect the cost and terms of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the
Notes.

**Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings.**

The Conditions of Issue provide that, if at any time following the issue date of the Existing Notes, the
Notes receive a rating of ‘‘BBB�’’ or better from Standard & Poor’s and ‘‘Baa3’’ or better from Moody’s
and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing
until such time that the Notes receive a rating of below ‘‘BBB�’’ from Standard & Poor’s and below
‘‘Baa3’’ from Moody’s, certain covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Covenants—Suspension of Covenants’’. If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would_
be able to incur additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may
conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes, will ever
achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**The Additional Notes will be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the**
**relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies.**

The Additional Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Clearstream
Banking. Interests in the global notes will be recorded in book-entry form only. Ownership of interests in
each global note will be limited to persons who have accounts with Clearstream Banking or persons who
hold interests through participants. The global notes representing the Additional Notes will be deposited
with Clearstream Banking. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the
global notes representing the Additional Notes will be made to Deutsche Bank AG as Paying Agent, which
will make payments to Clearstream Banking. Clearstream Banking will, in turn, distribute those payments
to its participants that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the Additional Notes in
accordance with its procedures and these payments will be credited by such participants to indirect
participants for the benefit of the holders of the co-ownership interests (Miteigentumsanteile) in the
Additional Notes represented by each global note. After payment to Clearstream Banking, we will have no
responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts in respect of the
Additional Notes. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of
Clearstream Banking and, if you are not a participant in Clearstream Banking, on the procedures of the
participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under
the Conditions of Issue. See ‘‘Book-Entry, Delivery and Form’’.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be A . We will use the proceeds from the
Offering, together with cash-in-hand and bank balances, (i) to redeem in full the A150,000,000 outstanding
principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes on June, 2019 (the ‘‘Floating Rate Notes Redemption
**Date’’) and (ii) to pay costs, fees and expenses related to the Refinancing.**

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds. The actual amounts set forth in the
table and in the accompanying footnotes are subject to adjustment and may differ at the time of the
consummation of the Refinancing depending on several factors, including differences from our estimate of
costs, fees and expenses.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth our consolidated cash-in-hand, bank balances and our capitalization as of
March 31, 2019, on a historical basis and as adjusted to give effect to the Offering and the application of
the proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, as described under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ as if they had occurred
on March 31, 2019.

The historical consolidated financial information has been derived from the 2019 Unaudited Three
Months Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. All data in the table below
represent the carrying amounts except for the Notes offered hereby. The adjusted information below is
illustrative only and does not purport to be indicative of our capitalization following the completion of the
Refinancing.

You should read this table in conjunction with _‘‘Summary—The Refinancing’’, ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’,_
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’, ‘‘Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements’’,_ _‘‘Description of the Notes’’ and the historical financial statements and_

(1) As adjusted amount reflects the amount of cash-in-hand, bank balances assuming (i) the completion of the offering of the
Additional Notes at an issue price of 100% and (ii) the completion of the Refinancing had occurred on March 31, 2019.
Cash-in-hand, bank balances at the time of the completion of the Offering on the actual issue date of the Additional Notes and
upon completion of the Refinancing will be different. We had cash-in-hand, bank balances of A152.3 million as of April 30, 2019.
As adjusted amount also does not reflect (i) A20.1 million of total dividend payments by the Issuer on May 2, 2019 or
(ii) payment by the purchasers of the Additional Notes of an amount equal to the accrued interest on the Additional Notes from
March 31, 2019 to, but not including, the issue date of the Additional Notes.

(2) As adjusted amounts do not reflect any drawings under Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing
Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, Facility A of the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities or the Existing Senior

precedent. We expect to satisfy all remaining conditions precedent on or around the issue date of the Additional Notes. As a
result, the New Senior Secured Facilities will remain undrawn on the issue date of the Additional Notes. We may utilize the
A30 million, A30 million and A15 million under the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW

under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility and the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility we will be required to make on June 30,
2019. For more details about the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, including scheduled repayments on the Existing Senior

**SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

The financial information contained in the following tables is derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018,
from the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the three-month
period ended March 31, 2019 as well as from the accounting records and other internal documents of the
Issuer. The results of operations for prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year or any future period.

In addition, we present certain unaudited consolidated financial information for the 12 months ended
March 31, 2019. This information was derived by adding our consolidated financial information for the
year ended March 31, 2018 derived from our audited consolidated financial statements to our unaudited
consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and subtracting our
unaudited consolidated financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2018.

The historical consolidated financial statements and the other historical consolidated financial information
presented below have been prepared on the basis of German GAAP, which differs in certain significant
respects from IFRS. For a discussion of significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS, see
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of
_Significant Differences between German GAAP and IFRS’’._

In the following tables, we also present certain non-GAAP measures and ratios, including total output,
gross profit, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, consolidated net income/(net loss) before income tax, trade
working capital, free cash flow, net cash flow, cash flow available for debt service, adjusted cash flow
available for debt service, cash flow from change in trade working capital and cash flow from change in
total working capital, capital expenditures, total financial debt as well as net financial debt and other pro
_forma data that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, German GAAP. Our management_
believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is helpful to investors because these and other
similar measures are widely used by certain investors, security analysts and other interested parties as
supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. However, you should not construe these non-GAAP
measures as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with German GAAP or to cash flows
from operating activities, investing activities or financing activities. In addition, the non-GAAP measures
and ratios, including total output, gross profit, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, consolidated net income/(net
loss) before income tax, trade working capital, free cash flow, net cash flow, cash flow available for debt
service, adjusted cash flow available for debt service, cash flow from change in trade working capital and
cash flow from change in total working capital, capital expenditures, total financial debt as well as net
financial debt and other pro forma data presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies.

You should read the information set forth below in conjunction with the sections ‘‘Presentation of Financial
_Information’’, ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’, ‘‘Capitalization’’, ‘‘Summary Consolidated Financial and Other_
_Information’’ and ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’_
and the financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

(1) Total output (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as the sum of sales, increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in
process, other operating income and other own work capitalized.

(2) Gross profit (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated by deducting cost of materials from total output.

(3) EBITDA (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as sales, plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process,
_plus other operating income (excluding any extraordinary income), plus other own work capitalized, minus costs of materials,_
_minus personnel expenses,_ _minus other operating expenses (excluding any extraordinary expenses),_ _minus other taxes. In_
response to changes to German GAAP, which have resulted in certain changes to the presentation of our financial information
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 in the table above, we have adjusted the way we calculate EBITDA to ensure
consistency and comparability with our EBITDA reported for prior periods. While our reported EBITDA therefore excludes
the impact of any ‘‘extraordinary’’ items for all periods presented, it has not yet been adjusted for ‘‘items of exceptional size or
incidence’’, which is a new concept under German GAAP introduced by the BilRUG. Excluding the negative effect of
A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’ (including A13.9 million in additional costs as expenditure of
exceptional size or incidence and A2.1 million in lost sales) related to a longer than scheduled shutdown of the CHP in 2016, our
EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 would have been A170.7 million.

(4) Consolidated net income/(net loss) before income tax (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated by adding taxes on income
back to consolidated net income/(net loss) for the period.

(5) We define trade working capital (not a German GAAP measure) as inventories plus trade receivables, minus trade payables.

_Our calculation of trade working capital can be reconciled to the balance sheet as follows:_

(6) Total liabilities is calculated as investment grants for fixed assets, plus provisions, plus liabilities, plus deferred income.

(7) Total financial debt (not a German GAAP measure) means bank loans plus finance leases plus bonds, including the Existing
Notes.

(8) Net financial debt (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated by deducting cash-in-hand, bank balances from total financial
debt.

(9) Free cash flow (not a German GAAP measure) is defined as cash flows from operating activities plus cash flows from investing
activities.

(10) Net cash flow (not a German GAAP measure) is defined as net change in cash funds as presented in the Consolidated Cash
Flow Statement.

(11) We present adjusted cash flow available for debt service (not a German GAAP measure) as a measure of normalized free cash
flow which can be used to service debt. We calculate adjusted cash flow available for debt service as cash flow available for debt
service adjusted for the effects of extraordinary net income/(loss) as well as for the A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional size or

**OVERVIEW**

We are a leading, family-owned producer and supplier of containerboard and corrugated board in Central
Europe and are headquartered in Landau, Germany. According to Vision Hunters, we are the third largest
producer of corrugated board in Europe (by production capacity) through our corrugated board business
(‘‘Board’’) and the sixth largest producer of recycled containerboard in Europe (by production capacity)
through our containerboard business (‘‘Paper’’). We focus on the highly efficient production and
processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of corrugated board sheets for our
mostly family-owned box manufacturing customers. In this core market segment, we are the market leader
by volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, according to
Vision Hunters. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated
paper and packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that
bring added-value to our customers in the packaging industry, _i.e. the automated and integrated_
production of containerboard and corrugated board. Our customers serve various end markets, including
industrial/manufacturing, consumer durables, processed foods, non-food manufactured consumer goods
and fresh food. Unlike many fully integrated market players, we do not produce boxes and therefore do
not compete with our box manufacturing customers but instead focus solely on the production of
containerboard and corrugated board.

Through our large scale and highly flexible production, built up primarily via a greenfield approach, we are
able to realize significant economies of scale. Since we commenced operations in 1992, we have carefully
selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a greenfield
strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we
operate. As a result, we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high
technological standards, resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and
relatively low requirements for additional capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the
high technological standards of our production facilities, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from
major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for light-weight packaging, (ii) the
increasing importance of small-size packaging due to the growing importance of e-commerce, and (iii) the
general trend towards a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and energy, which can help
reduce costs, CO2 emissions and fresh water consumption.

Our core business comprises Paper and Board. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible
containerboard production using almost exclusively recycled paper, with high output volumes to increase
cost efficiency and short delivery times. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and the first three months of 2019,
containerboard produced by Paper accounted for most of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our
corrugated board production within Board. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and the
ability of Board to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly
flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. In addition, our customers benefit from our
integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking
options.

Paper manufactures containerboard at our two paper mills in Germany, with an envisaged total annual
production capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons of containerboard. Our two existing paper machines,
PM1 in Burg and PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, have complementary production layouts which allow us to
produce brown containerboard with grammages between 60-230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recycled
paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the
appropriate widths for Board’s ten existing corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic,
France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a total annual production capacity of
approximately 1,440,000 tons of corrugated board, including our latest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’
(PW12) at Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom. Our historic greenfield location strategy ensures close
customer proximity and high production flexibility. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we
further acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH, the combined heat and power plant (the ‘‘CHP’’) adjacent to
our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and certain related assets (the ‘‘CHP Acquisition’’). As a result thereof,
we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine
PM2 ourselves (‘‘Power’’).

In 2018, we sold approximately 1,151,000 tons of corrugated board and approximately 176,000 tons of
containerboard to external customers across Europe, resulting in external corrugated board and
containerboard sales, respectively, of A840.0 million (86.9% of total sales) and A84.5 million (8.7% of total
sales). Paper’s total sales in 2018 include A17.9 million (1.9% of total sales) in revenues from the sale of
electricity and revenues from the incineration of refuse-derived fuel resulting from the integration of the
CHP as well as A9.7 million (1.0% of total sales) in sales from passing purchased fuel costs to Sales and

Solutions GmbH. Total external sales by Board and Paper in 2018 (including sales other than corrugated
board or containerboard sales, respectively) amounted to A840.8 million (87.0% of total sales) and
A112.9 million (11.7% of total sales). Our total sales and EBITDA in 2018 amounted to A966.1 million and
A275.5 million, respectively. Sales in Germany (origin), our core market, accounted for 55.8% of total sales
and 42.0% of sales by volume in 2018.

Primarily to support our core business, Paper and Board, we have established our own logistics operations,
including a fleet of currently 59 trucks (‘‘Logistics’’). Most of the remaining A12.4 million in sales (1.3% of
total sales) in 2018 were generated by Logistics.

Founded in 1991, we are indirectly majority-owned by J¨urgen Heindl, our founder and chief executive
officer.

**KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

We principally generate revenue through the sale of containerboard and corrugated board. We sell our
corrugated board only to third-party customers in the packaging industry. Our mills primarily supply the
containerboard we produce to Group-owned corrugated board plants; however, only third-party sales are
reflected in our revenue. We also sell, to a lesser degree, containerboard to third parties. In 2018,
corrugated board sales and external containerboard sales accounted for 86.9% and 8.7%, respectively, of
our total sales.

Key factors that affect our operating results are:

  - changes in demand and industry production capacity;

   - the cost of recycled paper, other raw materials and other costs of manufacturing;

  - changes in energy costs, both as a result of market price movements and regulatory changes,
including energy tax refund schemes and other statutory accommodations for energy intensive
industries;

   - changes in freight and transportation costs;

   - our ability to pass on price increases in raw materials and other input costs into the prices we charge
for third-party sales of containerboard and corrugated board;

   - the performance and the utilization of our production sites as well as the performance of certain
facilities owned and operated by us, such as the CHP;

   - the level of vertical integration between Paper and Board;

  - currency exchange rate movements;

   - our ability to achieve cost savings; and

   - our ability to successfully complete ongoing and future expansion projects.

71


-----

Because many of these factors are beyond our control and certain of these factors have historically been
volatile, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance and it is difficult to predict
future performance with any degree of certainty.

**Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input Costs**

_Fluctuations in Demand and Industry Capacity_

Demand for our products is generally driven by the level of economic growth and activity. Increased levels
of economic growth and activity typically result in higher per capita use of packaging materials, both with
respect to transportation of goods and consumer presentation. This increase in the use of packaging
materials (including paper-based packaging materials), in turn, results in an increase in the demand for our
recycled containerboard and corrugated board products. Because the markets for containerboard and
corrugated board products in the developed economies in which we primarily operate are generally
mature, historically there has been a close correlation between general economic growth and demand for
packaging products such as corrugated containers and, therefore, for their component materials such as
containerboard and corrugated board. Less developed economies, including those in Eastern Europe, have
a lower per capita consumption of packaging materials and therefore also of containerboard and
corrugated board products but also, as a result, have the potential for higher growth as per capita
consumption of packaging materials increases towards levels of developed economies.

To a lesser degree, demand for corrugated containers and their component materials, including our
containerboard and corrugated board, is affected by changes in their market prices. Significant increases in
the price of corrugated containers have, on occasion, resulted in decreased demand as end-customers
elected to purchase substitute products, such as reusable plastic containers, wooden crates or shrink-wrap.

Historically, prices for containerboard and corrugated board have tended to be cyclical. This cyclicality has
resulted from significant imbalances in supply and demand for containerboard. On the one hand,
containerboard production capacity cannot be readily adapted to reflect changing market conditions due to
the high capital intensity of paper production facilities and the long lead time between the planning and
construction of a new containerboard mill. On the other hand, significant containerboard and corrugated
board price reductions and inventory growth have resulted when capacity has exceeded demand. In the
past, many leading paper manufacturers have reacted to reduced demand by taking downtime and by
rationalizing high-cost and inefficient capacity.

_Fluctuations in Raw Material Costs_

Because the primary raw material for the production of recycled containerboard is recycled paper, the
price of which tends to fluctuate, our two recycled containerboard mills (i.e., our paper machines PM1 and
PM2) can experience temporary increases and decreases in profits. Except for the period between 2009
and 2010 following the financial and economic crisis, our paper mill in Burg (PM1) has historically
generated a relatively stable margin, in part because we primarily sell our containerboard to our own
corrugated board plants. As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board production capacity
in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have increased to approximately 82% (or 93%, if we
include containerboard sales to swap partners) of the total sales, by volume, of Paper in 2018. With the fast
and successful ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica,
Poland, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been
operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between
Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site
(PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated
board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of
our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the
corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019,,
i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production
within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. As we have already
commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with
test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020) and plan to
establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2019 and 2021
(including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production
in late 2020 or early 2021), we expect to successively increase this net short position with regard to
containerboard even further at least in the short-term to mid-term. We therefore currently do not expect

72


-----

the volume of our external containerboard sales to significantly increase again unless and until we
complete our proposed further paper machine project (PM3). For more details on our expansion projects
and investment program, see also’’—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ below.

Our overall profitability is also affected by the length of time it takes us to translate price increases in raw
materials and other input costs into prices we charge for third-party sales of containerboard and
corrugated board. To the extent our containerboard is sold internally, our profitability will only be affected
by the ability to recover any price increases from third-party sales of corrugated board to our third party
customers in the packaging industry. Furthermore, to the extent that selling prices fall, if we are unable to
generate cost savings through producing products more efficiently or lower our fixed costs, our results may
be negatively affected.

An important driver of recycled paper prices is the balance of supply and demand for paper products in
general as well as collection rates of recycled paper. When the price of recycled paper increases,
containerboard manufacturers attempt to raise their prices to preserve profit margins, which generally
narrow as a result of higher raw material costs. It typically takes approximately two to three months for
mills to pass on their raw material price increases to corrugated board manufacturers. In turn, the
manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover containerboard cost
increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for these manufacturers, including us, to
pass these increases on to their customers.

In a down cycle, as recycled paper prices fall, manufacturers of paper and paper-based packaging products
(including manufacturers of containerboard and corrugated board) attempt to maintain prices. In the past,
we have typically been able to maintain our prices for two to three months in such a down cycle. As a
result, the effect of price fluctuations on our mills and corrugated board operations varies, depending on
the relevant point in the industry cycle. During periods of rising containerboard prices, our profitability can
therefore be adversely affected. Conversely, during periods of declining containerboard prices, our
profitability can be positively affected.

However, our ability to pass the costs of our raw materials and other input costs on to our packaging
customers depends on a number of other factors, including the supply and demand balance for
containerboard and corrugated board in a particular region and the ability of our customers to maintain or
increase prices with their own customers. We generate almost all of our sales through purchase orders
from our customers based on our price lists which we adjust in response to market price movements and
only have very few contracts with our customers which provide minimum purchase obligations and/or
pricing clauses that would allow us to automatically pass increased costs on to our customers. As a result of
these factors, there can be no guarantee that the price of recycled paper and the prices for our
containerboard and corrugated board products will always be closely correlated. Any extended mismatch
between the price of recycled paper and the market prices for our products could have a significant effect
on our margins and overall profitability.

For example, between 2009 and 2010, our results of operations and financial condition deteriorated. There
were two main reasons for this deterioration. First, the global financial and economic crisis led to a
significant drop in the price of recycled paper in the second half of 2008, followed by a significant decrease
in the demand for our products and a corresponding decrease in the market prices for both containerboard
and corrugated board. Following the significant drop in the prices for recycled paper in the second half of
2008, the prices for recycled paper started to recover in the first half of 2009, notwithstanding the
continuing economic weakness and contrary to historic trends. This, in turn, led to a compression of our
margins during the third quarter of 2009 when the sales prices for some of our finished products were
insufficient to cover our variable input costs. As a result, we incurred significant losses and a few of our
competitors were forced to close or mothball less efficient production facilities, which led at least
temporarily to a drop in market-wide containerboard and corrugated board capacity. Our margins only
returned to more sustainable levels towards the end of 2010, following multiple price increases for recycled
paper, containerboard and corrugated board. Conversely, due to a combination of (i) a higher level of
integration between our containerboard and corrugated board businesses, (ii) positive effects from
measures we took as part of our Continuous Improvement Program and the immediate measures we took
at the time in response to the deterioration of our results of operations and financial condition, and
(iii) sustained economic growth in Germany in 2014 and 2015, we were able to increase the average selling
price for both our containerboard and corrugated board products in 2014 and 2015, while the price of
recycled paper generally remained stable throughout 2014 and only moderately increased in the second
and third quarters of 2015, which had a significant positive impact on our margins and general profitability.

During the course of 2016, corrugated board and containerboard prices slowly and steadily decreased from
2015 price levels. At the same time prices for recycled paper increased throughout the first three quarters
of 2016, before decreasing slightly in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result, following a strong
improvement in our operating results in 2014 and 2015, we experienced a leveling of our operating results
in 2016.

Due to strong demand, especially from Asia, prices for recycled paper were significantly higher during
2017 compared to 2016, especially during the first half of 2017. The average price per ton for recycled
paper grades we purchased was approximately A150 during 2017, compared to A130 during 2016. During
the third quarter of 2017, however, prices for recycled paper started to gradually decline again, a trend
which continued through the end of 2017, in part as a result of policy changes and stricter import controls
in China, which resulted in decreasing recycled paper exports to China. During the fourth quarter of 2017,
the average price per ton for recycled paper grades we purchased was approximately A142 per ton,
compared to A136 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2016. Partly as a result of the increases in recycled paper
prices, prices for recycled containerboard in Europe also steadily increased again during the course of
2017. The average prices for our containerboard increased from A376 per ton (for the overall product
portfolio mix sold externally) during 2016 to A413 per ton during 2017. During the course of 2017, we were
able to achieve aggregate price increases for our containerboard of A90-100 per ton in total, which are not
fully reflected in the average sales figures. On the other hand, the average price per ton for the
containerboard we were required to purchase externally also increased in 2017. Party as a result of the
increases in recycled containerboard prices, corrugated board prices also increased again during 2017,
following the increases in containerboard prices with a slight time lag. During the course of 2017, the
average prices for our corrugated board increased from approximately A634 per ton during 2016 to A657
per ton during 2017. During the course of 2017, we were able to achieve aggregate price increases for our
corrugated board products of A90-100 per ton in total, which are not fully reflected in the average sales
figures.

Due to decreases in demand from outside Europe, resource price levels for recycled paper declined in the
first and second quarter of 2018. Since then, prices for recycled paper remained at a favorable level for the
rest of the year. The average price per ton for recycled paper grades we purchased was approximately A108
during 2018, compared to A150 during 2017. In the first three months of 2019, the purchasing price for
recycled paper remained at an almost stable low price point. On the other hand, prices for both corrugated
board and containerboard increased in the first quarter of 2018, remaining elevated for the remainder of
the year but with a slight trend towards normalisation in the fourth quarter. The average prices for our
containerboard increased from A413 per ton (for the overall product portfolio mix sold externally) during
2017 to A480 per ton during 2018, while the average price per ton for the containerboard we were required
to purchase externally also increased in 2018. After a continuously upward trend in 2017 and the first
quarter of 2018, prices for recycled containerboard were primarily stable in the second and third quarter of
2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, prices for recycled containerboard started to decline. This
development usually follows the price development of recycled paper. In 2018, we observed an opposite
development since purchasing prices for recycled paper declined in the first and second quarter of 2018
and remained at a low level for the rest of the year 2018. Corrugated board prices increased again during
2018, following the increases in containerboard prices with a slight time lag. During the course of 2018, the
average prices for our corrugated board increased 11.1% from approximately A657 per ton during 2017 to
A730 per ton during 2018. Following the containerboard market price development, prices for corrugated
board increased since March 2017. In March and April 2018, the earlier containerboard price increase was
passed on to the corrugated board customers, which led to a price peak in May and a slightly decreasing
trend since the beginning of the third quarter.

During the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, both containerboard and corrugated board
experienced a considerable price normalization, i.e. prices for both containerboard and corrugated board
started to decline. Due to the typical time lags in passing on price developments to customers, we expect
this normalization of containerboard and corrugated board price levels to further negatively impact our
performance in 2019. In the short-to-mid term, we anticipate further potential downward price
adjustments as part of the ongoing normalization of the market conditions, which is likely to have a
negative impact on our margins and EBITDA.

_Fluctuations in Energy Costs_

Another important input for us is energy. Our production processes, in particular the production of
containerboard at our two mills, are energy intensive. In 2008, we entered into certain framework and

74


-----

ancillary agreements with EnBW for the supply of steam to PM2 via the CHP, which reduced our exposure
to fluctuations in gas prices. As described in more detail under ‘‘—The CHP Acquisition’’ below, effective
as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH from EnBW, the CHP and
certain related assets outright. As a result thereof, we started producing a significant portion of the energy
required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves. The completion of the CHP Acquisition
constituted a significant milestone in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and allowed us to
significantly reduce our energy costs. However, our production processes are nevertheless reliant on third
parties for the supply of energy. Market prices for energy, in particular for electricity, oil and natural gas,
have historically been volatile and have had a corresponding effect on our production costs. As a result, we
have undertaken significant efforts in recent years to decrease our energy consumption and costs
throughout our business. For further information, see ‘‘Business—Procurement/Purchasing—Energy’’ and
‘‘Business—Sustainability Focus; Research and Development’’.

The key drivers of our energy expenses have been, and will continue to be, fluctuations in the market prices
for energy, the performance of the CHP adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt as well as
regulatory decisions. Any extended shutdowns of the CHP may have a negative impact on our results of
operations. For example, a longer than scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the third and
fourth quarters of 2016 resulted in A16.0 million in items of exceptional size or incidence, including
A13.9 million in exceptional expenses and A2.1 million in lost sales. In addition, in Germany, our core
market, energy prices have been strongly impacted by regulatory decisions related to the so-called
‘‘Energiewende’’, a significant shift in government policy following the nuclear accident in Fukushima,
Japan in 2011. The energy policy in Germany focuses on promoting the development of renewable energy
sources and contemplates the complete cessation of the production of nuclear power by 2021. To mitigate
the impact of the resulting significant increases in electricity prices for energy-intensive industries, the
German government adopted rules that provide for various businesses, including us, to be reimbursed for
certain infrastructure investment surcharges necessary for the implementation of the ‘‘Energiewende’’.
However, those rules have not only been subject to challenges in German courts and EU scrutiny as
potentially illegal subsidies, but also continue to be the subject of political scrutiny by various interest
groups. Although the relevant rules have been modified to address certain of these concerns, there is no
guarantee that they will not change again or that we will continue to be able to benefit from current
accommodations, reimbursement rules and/or energy tax refund schemes.

Notwithstanding increases in production volumes, our energy costs have declined in recent years for a
variety of reasons, including (i) our efforts to reduce energy consumption, in particular with regard to
PM2, (ii) falling energy prices, (iii) the optimization of our energy procurement processes, (iv) the
optimization of the operating costs of the CHP, in particular with regard to ash disposal, as well as (v) the
full utilization of all available accommodations, credits and refunds under applicable energy laws and
regulations. For more information about our energy management efforts, see ‘‘—Sustainability Focus;
_Research and Development’’._

_Fluctuations in Freight/Logistics Costs_

Our production operations require us to coordinate and monitor complex logistics processes between each
step of our internal value chain and our production processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and
products. This includes the shipment of large rolls of containerboard from our two paper mills in Germany
to our ten corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and
the United Kingdom as well as the shipment of our finished corrugated board to our customers in the
packaging industry (box plants). We meet our freight and logistics requirements mainly through the use of
external logistics companies and, to a much lesser extent, our own fleet of currently 59 trucks. Due to the
relatively large size and weight of our products compared to value, freight and logistics expenses play an
important role in our business, and fluctuations in freight prices can have a significant impact on our
profitability.

**Currency Fluctuations**

Given the growing geographic spread of our operations, we are increasingly exposed to currency exchange
rate fluctuations. For example, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and Poland do not use the euro
as their national currency. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 7%, 7% and 16% of our total sales
derived from sales in British pounds, Czech koruna and Polish zloty, respectively. In addition, we currently
finance several of our foreign subsidiaries, including subsidiaries outside the euro zone, through
borrowings in euro.

75


-----

To reduce (but not eliminate) our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the Polish
zloty, Progroup Board sp. z o.o. entered into the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility on December 1, 2015 to
pay back euro denominated intra-Group loans. To finance the investment in our corrugated board
production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, Progroup Board sp. z o.o. entered into the 2016 Senior
Secured PLN Facility on May 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2019, PLN 58.9 million (carrying amount at
March 31, 2019: A13.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006, which was the
exchange rate of the zloty against the euro reported by the National Bank of Poland on March 31, 2019) in
borrowings under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding, and PLN 76.0 million
(carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A17.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN
4.3006) in borrowings under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding. As of the date of
this offering memorandum, the same amounts of borrowings remain outstanding under the 2015 Senior
Secured PLN Facility and under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility. For more details about the Existing
Senior Secured PLN Facilities, including scheduled repayments on the Existing Senior Secured PLN
Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities’’.

To reduce (but not eliminate) our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and the British
pound, Progroup Board Ltd. entered into the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility on December 21, 2017.
As of March 31, 2019, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility was fully utilized with drawings of
GBP3 million (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A3.5 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of
A1.00 = GBP 0.8583, which was the exchange rate of the British pound against the euro reported by the
European Central Bank on March 31, 2019). The Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility was fully utilized as
of the date of this offering memorandum. For more details about the Existing Senior Secured GBP
Facility, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility’’.

Prior to 2015, we were not permitted under our former financing arrangements to hedge for currency risks.
As a result, fluctuations in the value of local currencies against the euro have had, and may have in the
future, a significant effect on our operations and on our reported results in euro and the comparability of
our performance between financial periods can be significantly affected by fluctuations in local currencies
against the euro. We have since started to implement foreign currency risk management in order to
monitor our foreign currency risk and to enable us to consider taking action if we decide to do so, but there
is no assurance that such measures will be effective.

The relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar is also important for the European containerboard
industry, because exports from the European market influence the balance of supply and demand and the
price development of containerboard in Europe. Movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rate may also
have an effect on trading, because a strong U.S. dollar tends to make U.S. dollar exports less competitive,
while a weak euro may create export opportunities for European containerboard producers, which can
reduce containerboard supplies in the European market and promote price stability. Conversely, a weak
U.S. dollar over a sustained period has historically resulted in lower (U.S. dollar-denominated) exports by
European containerboard manufacturers with a negative (for our business) effect on the supply and
demand balance and an immediate effect on the pricing of containerboard in Europe. In addition, a weak
U.S. dollar over a sustained period has, in the past, also resulted in lower sales by other European
manufacturers who ship products in corrugated packaging, resulting in lower European demand for
corrugated packaging and, therefore, for our containerboard and corrugated board. A weak U.S. dollar
may also result in additional competition in the European market from U.S. manufacturers that have an
incentive to sell more products in Europe, due to increased European demand for the relatively lowerpriced U.S. goods over higher-priced European goods.

**Significant Synergies through High Degree of Vertical Integration between Paper and Board**

In 2018, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for approximately 75% of the containerboard, by
volume, used by our corrugated board production within Board. As a result of the steady expansion of our
corrugated board production capacity in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have
increased from approximately 62% (or 67%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total
containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to approximately 82% (or 93%, if we include
containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2018. With the
fast and successful ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica,
Poland during 2017 and early 2018, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals
and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of
integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board
production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the

76


-----

new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further
improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further
increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of
containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our
corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper.
As we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in
Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter
of 2020) and plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe
between 2020 and 2023 (including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to
commence production in late 2020 or early 2021), we expect to successively increase this net short position
with regard to containerboard even further at least in the short-term. We therefore currently do not expect
the volume of our external containerboard to significantly increase again unless and until we complete our
proposed further paper machine project (PM3) in the second half of 2020. For more details on our
expansion projects and investment program, see also’’—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ below

With an envisaged total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons, Paper produced
approximately 1,020,000 tons and 1,035,000 tons of containerboard in 2018 and 2016, respectively. In 2018,
approximately 811,000 tons were sold internally to Board (2016: 738,000 tons of internal containerboard
sales), and a further approximately 111,500 tons were sold pursuant to swap agreements with other
containerboard producers (2016: 106,000 tons of sales to swap partners), which allow us to reduce
transportation costs, optimize our production program and swap internally produced containerboard for
certain containerboard grades we do not produce in sufficient quantities, such as kraftliner. The remaining
approximately 64,000 tons of containerboard we sold in 2018 were sold externally (2016: approximately
198,000 tons of external containerboard sales, excluding sales to swap partners). With a total annual
corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,440,000 tons (including (i) 100,000 tons of
capacity of our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, which commenced
production in early March 2018 and (ii) more than 200,000 tons of capacity of our new corrugated board
‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, which commenced production in January 2019)
as of the date of this offering memorandum (2016: total annual corrugated board production capacity of
approximately 1,130,000 tons), Board produced approximately 1,151,000 tons of containerboard in 2018,
compared to approximately 930,000 tons of corrugated board in 2016. We believe that a high degree of
vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality
containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business.
At the same time, we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or
improve our overall Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared
to corrugated board margins) of certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our
integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking
options. The steady increase in the degree of vertical integration between Paper and Board over the last
few years has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply chain.

**Expansion Projects and Investment Program**

To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in
Europe in the long-term and to allow us to successfully meet ongoing and expected future market growth
and the requirements of our customers with regard to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to
continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of our
production facilities as part of our long-term ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy. In addition to further capacity
expansion, our ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy, among other things, also contemplates a gradual technological
transition and generation change away from the use of corrugators with a trim width of 2.5m, which are
installed and currently in use at some of our older corrugated board production sites, to the use of more
modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our corrugated board production sites.
Following the successful completion of the ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site
(PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which commenced production in October 2015, we had already
accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals in 2016 and were already operating within our target
corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. However, in the short-term to
mid-term, we still intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our
corrugated board production capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market
opportunities for profitable growth, similar to those that led to the successful establishment of our most
recent production sites (PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12) in Pl¨ossberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland),
Drizzona (Italy) and Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom). In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we

77


-----

intend to primarily achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion opportunities via greenfield
projects.

In addition to the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica,
Poland during 2017 and early 2018 following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, we
commenced production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, in early March
2018 and at our newest corrugated production site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, in January
2019. As with our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany and our corrugated
board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we established our production site (PW11) in Drizzona,
Italy, as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of a customer,
Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l., which allows us to supply this new customer largely without
freight and other logistics costs. The commencement of production at our corrugated board production
site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately
100,000 tons, also marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. With a total
investment of approximately A85-90 million into the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega
plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom to replace our now decommissioned corrugated board
production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers from the new site, we have now also become a
significant player in the UK market. This newest corrugated board production site operates with a 3.35m
trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than
double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), which we established in
2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width. We believe that the new production site, with its large
capacity and state-of-the-art equipment, is one of the largest and most efficient corrugated sheet board
plants globally and positions us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we have
historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins.

While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including the three packaging park
projects (PW9, PW10 and PW11), our newest corrugated board production site (PW12) in the United
Kingdom as well as the proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW13 and PW14), we are also
evaluating and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire attractive assets from competitors which
would complement our existing network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our
corrugated board production capacity and meet the other internal investment and financing criteria
described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our relationships with certain large
and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with significant new
customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated
board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers.

With the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland,
we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at
the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and
Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in
Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board
‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our
other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated
board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect
that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board
will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. In the short-term to mid-term, we
nevertheless intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated
board production capacity. We have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board
production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of
2019 or the first quarter of 2020. We expect to make total net investments (net of subsidies) of
approximately A60 million at this site, which is slightly higher than our earlier estimates of approximately
A50 million. This cost increase primarily relates to additional investments which will increase the annual
corrugated board production capacity of the new site to approximately 175,000 tons, from the originally
proposed capacity of approximately 140, 000 tons. Higher than originally expected civil engineering costs
(due to the booming construction sector) also contributed to the expected overall cost increase. In
addition, we plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe
between 2020 and 2023, including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14), which we expect will
operate with a 3.35m trim width and have an annual corrugated board production capacity of up to 215,000
tons. We expect to invest approximately A70-75 million into this new plant, which will have capabilities
similar to our ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and, we envisage, will commence

78


-----

production in late 2020 or early 2021. Primarily to fund our expected investments into this new site, we
entered into the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and
the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, with total commitments of A75 million. For more details about
these New Senior Secured Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior
_Secured Erste Bank Facility’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured LBBW_
_Facilities’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’. As a_
result of these proposed additional corrugated board production sites, we expect our annual corrugated
board production capacity to increase from approximately 3.0 billion square meters (including our
corrugated board production sites (PW11 and PW12) in Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United
Kingdom) to approximately 4.2 billion square meters.

Furthermore, in order to preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard
in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner in sufficient quantities to meet the majority of the sourcing
requirements of the expanding corrugated board production within Board, we have also begun to actively
pursue the realization of a further paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.
Earthworks for the new paper machine already started in January 2019 and, subject (among other things)
to obtaining the missing regulatory approvals and construction proceeding according to plan, we currently
expect this further state-of-the-art paper machine to start production in the second half of 2020, with a
total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 750,000 tons. Following completion of the ramp-up
phase of this potential further paper mill, this would mean an increase of the total annual containerboard
capacity of Paper from currently approximately 1,100,000 tons to approximately 1,850,000 tons. The new
paper machine (PM3) will have a 9.2m trim width, which would allow us to optimize containerboard
production to meet the requirements of the more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at
most of our newer corrugated board production sites, which would result in low volumes of cutting scrap
and higher productivity. Once PM3 has commenced operations, we also plan for further specialization of
our then three paper machines which we expect will further enhance the productivity of all our paper
machines as each paper mill will be able to focus on clearly defined paper grades. We currently expect total
net investment costs (i.e. net of expected subsidies) of approximately A465 million for this new paper
machine project over a several year period, including approximately A116.7 million of initial expenditures
(e.g. for advance payments for the paper machine and certain preliminary work) we had already incurred
as of the end of the first quarter of 2019. We expect to fund any such investments with a combination of
cash generated from our operating activities and additional borrowings, including drawings under the
Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing
Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility. The currently expected
total net investment costs of approximately A465 million in connection with the proposed establishment of
our newest paper mill (PM3) significantly exceed our earlier estimates of A375-400 million, primarily due
to certain additional strategic and value accretive investments we decided to make, which we expect to
have significant economical as well as ecological benefits once the new paper mill will be operational. A
large portion of the increase in the expected total net investment costs relates to investments into more
energy-efficient components as part of our overall waste-heat concept from the new paper mill. The
installation of these components is not legally mandated, but we expect it will result in significant cost
savings in the mid- to long-term as well as a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 151,000 tons per year. In
addition, we decided to install a closed cycle waste water treatment system. Once our new paper mill is
operating at the full intended capacity of 750,000 tons of containerboard, we expect that this closed cycle
waste water treatment system will help us to avoid approximately 3,775,000 m[3] of waste water per year, cut
the fresh water consumption of the new paper mill by 3,750,000 m[3] and reduce CO2 emissions by
approximately a further 19,900 tons per year. At full capacity, the system is expected to produce
approximately 65,000,000 kWh per year of bio gas as part of the waste water treatment process. The paper
mill will use this bio gas in connection with its production process, cutting its natural gas consumption by
approximately 7-8%. We further believe that the proposed closed cycle waste water system will minimize
our reliance on third party waste water treatment facilities (which have led to capacity constraints at our
existing paper machine (PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany in the past) and result in significant related
cost savings in the future. We further decided to install (i) a steam turbine which will allow us to produce a
portion of the electricity requirements of the new paper mill in an environmentally friendly manner and
(ii) a direct rail connection, which will give us the option to ship a portion of our future production in an
environmentally friendly manner by rail and, we believe, result in savings of freight cost and other
operational benefits. An increase in the expected costs of the necessary civil engineering works, due to the
booming construction sector, also contributed to the overall increase in the expected total net investment
costs.

Even successful expansion (or acquisition) projects can have a negative impact on our profitability in the
short-term. For example, our reduced profitability between 2009 and 2010 following the global financial
and economic crisis coincided with the launch of production at our corrugated board production sites in
Strykow, Poland (PW7) and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW8) and at our paper mill in
Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany (PM2), which involved significant start-up and ramp-up costs. The related
costs were largely expected and are normal in our industry, but their timing further exacerbated our
financial condition. In addition, even in a positive market environment, it typically takes two to three years
from the launch of a new corrugated board production site until the production site is fully utilized. For
example, we launched our corrugated board production site in Strykow, Poland (PW7) in 2009, but the site
only completed its ramp-up phase in 2012 and therefore, did not operate at a three-shift capacity for an
entire year until 2013. Our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany commenced
production in October 2015 and completed its ramp-up phase in 2017, while our corrugated board
production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland completed a very fast and successful ramp-up and will likely
operate at a full, three-shift capacity for an entire year for the first time in 2018. Our corrugated board
production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy commenced production in March 2018 and we expect the ramp
up of production to continue through the end of 2020. We expect our newest corrugated board production
site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (which commence production in January 2019) and our
proposed new corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany and proposed further
corrugated board ‘‘mega-plant’’ (PW14) described above to also undergo ramp-up phases of different
durations with a corresponding impact on our result of operations. The start-up and ramp-up costs and
short-term to mid-term impact on our profitability of our latest paper machine project (PM3) will be
proportionately higher, due to the much larger size, higher level of complexity and longer implementation
timeframe of such a project, compared to the establishment of a new corrugated board production site. For
our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2), for example, we executed some of the definitive agreements
with our main project partners (including the related financing arrangements) as early as the summer of
2008, before starting initial ground works later that year. In addition, even though our paper mill in
Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2) commenced operations in March 2010, it only completed its initial ramp-up phase
in 2013. Since then, we have been continuing our efforts to further optimize our operations at our mill in
Eisenh¨uttenstadt, which involves not only the optimization of the performance of PM2, but also the
optimization of connected processes, including the operation of the CHP we acquired from EnBW
effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015. For more information about the risks associated with the
integration of potential expansion projects and acquisitions, see also ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our
_Industry and our Business—The costs and difficulties of integrating complementary businesses through organic_
_and acquisitive expansion could impede our future growth and adversely affect our competitiveness’’._

**Achieving further cost-savings and efficiency improvements through further increased external**
**containerboard purchases**

We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona,
Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the newest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’
(PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom in January 2019 as well as further improved utilization of our
other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated
board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019. As already
described in more detail above, apart from a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld,
Germany (for which we have already commence construction and expect test production to start in the
fourth quarter in 2019 or the first quarter of 2020), we currently expect to establish up to three further
corrugated board production sites in Central Europe between 2020 and 2023. See also ‘‘—Expansion
_Projects and Investment Program’’. Unless and until we complete the proposed new paper machine project_
(PM3), this expected increase in our corrugated board production may cause us to further increase the
level of internal containerboard sales to Board (and thereby the level of integration between Paper and
Board) in 2019 and to increasingly rely on purchasing containerboard from third party suppliers. We
believe that targeted external containerboard purchases that meet the specific sourcing requirements of
Board will give us additional flexibility and provide us with opportunities to further optimize
(i.e., minimize) our variable costs, for example, by allowing us to purchase containerboard that matches the
specific grade and optimal trim-width required for our corrugated board production from time to time,
from external suppliers located in close proximity to the relevant Board plants. We hope this will allow us
to further reduce cutting scrap, further optimize logistics expenses and give us additional flexibility to
optimize the utilization of our existing paper machines (PM1 and PM2).

**Continuous Improvement Program**

As described above, we operate in a cyclical industry where the price of our containerboard and corrugated
board as well as recycled paper, our primary raw material, is subject to cyclical fluctuations. Other major
cost items, such as personnel expenses, are the subject of annual increases, and the costs of energy and
freight, which are also significant expenses, have partly trended upwards. In order to maintain profitability
throughout the economic cycle, we have implemented a comprehensive profitability improvement program
(the ‘‘Continuous Improvement Program’’) to ensure the long-term success of our Group. Our Continuous
Improvement Program focuses on (i) improving the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities,
(ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and (iii) stabilizing our specific fixed costs in order to
achieve sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost leaders in our industry.

Since 2012, our main focus in connection with our goal of achieving sales excellence has been on
(i) growing our external sales in excess of the general growth in market volumes (and thereby increasing
our market share), (ii) maximizing the impact of the introduction of our ‘‘next generation’’ products into
the market, and (iii) optimizing our sales portfolio. As part of our efforts to optimize our variable costs, we
have focused on (i) reducing our consumption of raw materials, (ii) optimizing our energy consumption
and energy costs, especially at our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2), and (iii) reducing the purchase
prices of our key production factors, such as recycled paper, starch and freight services. Our continued
ability to implement these and other efficiency improvement projects successfully may have a significant
impact on our profitability. For more information about our past and ongoing efforts to ensure the
sustainability of our business and to maintain our position as a cost leader, see also ‘‘—Significant Synergies
_through High Degree of Vertical Integration between Paper and Board’’, ‘‘—Achieving further cost-savings and_
_efficiency improvements through increased external containerboard purchases’’ and ‘‘Business—Sustainability_
_Focus; Research and Development’’._

**The CHP Acquisition**

Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH from EnBW, the
combined heat and power plant adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany (the ‘‘CHP’’),
and certain related assets (such acquisition, the ‘‘CHP Acquisition’’). As a result thereof, we started
producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2
ourselves. The completion of the CHP Acquisition constituted a significant milestone in our efforts to
optimize our cost structure and allowed us to significantly reduce our energy costs.

However, following completion of the CHP Acquisition, we are bearing certain additional risks associated
with the ownership and operation of the CHP that were previously being borne by EnBW. In connection
with a scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in the third quarter of 2016, for example, we
discovered certain technical faults within the CHP that we were not previously aware of. See also ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Industry and our Business—We could be exposed to risks related to the CHP_
_which have not been detected during the due diligence process preceding the CHP Acquisition’’. Because of our_
long-term economic interest in the efficient and uninterrupted (except for necessary maintenance
shutdowns we schedule on a regular basis) operation of the CHP, we decided to significantly extend the
originally scheduled maintenance shutdown period to allow us to make certain repairs and replace certain
faulty components. This decision led to a significantly longer than scheduled maintenance shutdown of the
CHP in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and caused us to incur A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional
size or incidence’’, including A13.9 million in additional costs as expenditure of exceptional size or
incidence and A2.1 million in lost sales. We took this decision in the expectation that it would reduce the
risk of future unscheduled shutdowns related to the faulty components, which could have resulted in even
higher costs in the future. There were no significant unscheduled shutdowns of the CHP in 2017, 2018 or
the first three months of 2019.

There can be no guarantee that will be able to realize any cash savings as a result of the CHP Acquisition
in future periods. For example, there can be no guarantee that the actual annual personnel expenses,
repair and maintenance costs and insurance costs for the CHP will not be higher than previously estimated,
that these expenses will not increase further in the future or that the actual requirements for capital
investments per annum will not be higher than our previous estimates. Furthermore, following completion
of the CHP Acquisition, we became directly responsible for, and we are now bearing all risks related to, the
ownership and day-to-day operation of the CHP, which includes the risk of any further unexpected repair
costs, the risk of any further significant unscheduled or longer than scheduled shutdowns of the CHP, the
operational risks associated with the disposal of the ash generated by the CHP (i.e., that we are unable to

81


-----

procure the proper disposal of the ash and may therefore be forced to shut down the CHP) as well as
certain other operational and regulatory risks. See also ‘‘Risk Factors—We could be exposed to risks related
_to the CHP which have not been detected during the due diligence process preceding the CHP Acquisition’’._

**KEY INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS**

The following is a description of certain line items in our consolidated income statement.

**Sales**

Sales primarily include income derived from the sale of corrugated board and external sales of
containerboard. We report sales as sales in Germany and sales abroad, respectively, based on the country
in which the invoicing entity within the Group is located. As a result, this geographic split does not
necessarily reflect the location of our customers. Other sales primarily include freight sales of Logistics, for
example, when we hire out trucks from our own fleet to avoid empty trips or to make use of opportunities
in the freight market.

**Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process**

Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process records the increase/(decrease) in finished goods
and work in process at manufacturing cost. The manufacturing costs include direct material and labor costs
as well as material and production overheads allocated proportionally on the assumption of normal
utilization of production capacity.

**Other operating income**

Other operating income consists of all income from ordinary business activities not already recognized
under other income items. Other operating income includes, among other things, income from investment
subsidies, income from other periods, income from the release of provisions, refunds of energy tax, income
from insurance refunds from damage events, income from reduction of bad debt allowance, and exchange
rate gains.

**Cost of materials**

Cost of materials consists of costs of raw materials, consumables and supplies and purchased goods such as
recycled paper, externally purchased containerboard, costs of chemicals, costs for auxiliary materials as
well as pallet costs. It also includes costs of purchased services, including energy (i.e., for electricity, gas and
steam) and costs of waste disposal. In 2018, we also reclassified costs for water and waste water treatment
from part of ‘‘other operating expenses’’ to costs of materials.

**Personnel expenses**

Personnel expenses include all expenses for wages and salaries (including bonuses) and other employment
benefits, contributions to pension plans and social security contributions. Personnel expenses also include
the costs of hiring new personnel and training costs.

**Other operating expenses**

Other operating expenses primarily include freight expenses (39.6% of total other operating expenses in
2016, 38.4% of total other operating expenses in 2017 and 39.7% of total other operating expenses in
2018), maintenance costs, costs of replacing paper machine clothing’s, other production costs, expenses for
external labor, waste water treatment costs, expenses from exchange rate differences, rental and leasing
costs, legal and consulting expenses and expenses from other periods. In 2018, we also reclassified costs for
water and waste water treatment from part of ‘‘other operating expenses’’ to ‘‘costs of materials’’.

**Amortization and depreciation of fixed intangible and tangible assets**

We incur expense for depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible fixed
assets as a result of both scheduled depreciation and impairment losses on these assets. Depreciation and
amortization are usually charged on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the assets.

82


-----

**Interest income/(expenses), net**

Interest income/(expenses), net includes other interest and similar income as well as interest and similar
expenses. Interest and similar expenses primarily include interest expense and other financing costs related
to long-term loans, short-term bank liabilities as well as bank and bank guarantee provisions.

**Taxes**

Taxes comprise trade taxes, corporate taxes, foreign taxes, deferred taxes as well as other taxes, such as
taxes on substance (mainly real estate taxes as well as motor vehicle taxes).

(1) In response to certain changes to German GAAP with regard to the preparation of financial information for any period
beginning after December 31, 2015, we do not report ‘‘income/(loss) on ordinary activities’’ and ‘‘extraordinary net income/
(loss)’’ separately anymore. As a result, effective as of January 1, 2016, we report as ‘‘other operating income’’ and ‘‘other
operating expenses’’ certain items we would previously have reported as ‘‘extraordinary income’’ and ‘‘extraordinary expenses’’,
as applicable. ‘‘Other operating expenses’’ for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 as presented in the
table above includes A6.9 million and A65 thousand, respectively, we would previously have reported as ‘‘extraordinary
expenses’’.

(2) Total output (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as the sum of sales, increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in
process, other operating income and other own work capitalized.

(3) Gross profit (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated by deducting cost of materials from total output.

(4) EBITDA (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as sales, plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process,
_plus other operating income (excluding any extraordinary income), plus other own work capitalized, minus costs of materials,_
_minus personnel expenses,_ _minus other operating expenses (excluding any extraordinary expenses),_ _minus other taxes. While_
our reported EBITDA excludes the impact of any ‘‘extraordinary’’ items for all periods presented, it has not yet been adjusted
for ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’.

**_Sales_**

Total sales increased slightly by A1.6 million or 0.6%, from A243.8 million in the first three months of 2018
to A245.4 million in the first three months of 2019 due to further strong growth in our corrugated board
sales as a result of a higher volume sold and a slightly higher price level. Total corrugated board sales
increased by A11.0 million or 5.2% in the first three months in 2019 compared to the first three months of
2018. Corrugated board sales volumes increased by approximately 12,700 tons, from approximately 294.600
tons in the first three months of 2018 to approximately 307,300 tons in the first three months of 2019. This
increase in sales volumes was primarily attributable to our new corrugated board production site (PW11)
in Drizzona, Italy, which only commenced operations in March 2018. External sales of containerboard
decreased by approximately 19,300 tons or 36.0% from approximately 53,700 tons in the first three months
of 2018 to approximately 34,400 tons in the first three months of 2019 due to scheduled maintenance
shutdowns of both our existing paper machines (PM1 and PM2) in March 2019. Additionally, the increased
sales volume of corrugated board sold led to a higher internal usage of containerboard by 5.2% or 16,000
tons and therefore to a further decrease in the external volume sold. See also ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our
_Results of Operations—Significant Synergies through High Degree of Vertical Integration between Paper and_
_Board’’ above._

In the first three months of 2019, sales in Germany accounted for 52.7% of total sales compared to 57.7%
of total sales in the first three months of 2018. Sales in Germany decreased by A11.2 million or 8.0%, from
A140.6 million in the first three months of 2018 to A129.4 million in the first three months of 2019,
primarily due to a A9.9 million or 39.3% decrease in external containerboard sales for the reasons
described above. Sales of corrugated board in Germany decreased by A1.8 million or 1.7%, and other sales
in Germany increased by A0.5 million or 5.5%, primarily as a result of sales of electricity produced by the
CHP, sales related to the incineration of refused derived fuel and other sales at our paper machine PM1.
Corrugated board sales abroad increased by A12.8 million or 12.4%, from A103.2 million in the first three
months in 2018 to A116.0 million in the first three months in 2019 for the reasons described above.

Total corrugated board sales increased by A11.0 million or 5.2% in the first three months of 2019 compared
to the first three months of 2018, with the main growth momentum coming from our new Italian
operations. External sales of containerboard decreased by A9.9 million or 39.3%, from A25.3 million in the
first three months of 2018 to A15.3 million in the first three months of 2019, while other sales increased by
A0.5 million or 5.5%, from A9.8 million in the first three months of 2018 to A10.3 million in the first three

months of 2019. As a result, corrugated board sales as a percentage of total sales further increased from
85.6% in the first three months in 2018 to 89.5% in the first three months of 2019, while containerboard
sales as a percentage of total sales further decreased from 10.4% in the first three months of 2018 to 6.3%
in the first three months of 2019.

**_Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process_**

Other operating income increased by A1.8 million or 112.0% from A1.6 million in the first three months of
2018 to A3.3 million in the first three months of 2019, mainly as a result of higher income from exchange
rate differences which increased by A1.1 million or 199.2%, from A0.5 million in the first three months of
2018 to A1.6 million in the first three months of 2019. Income from other periods also increased by
A0.4 million or 54.5%, from A0.8 million in the first three months of 2018 to A1.3 million in the first three
months of 2019, primarily due to bonus credits from our suppliers for the previous year.

Income from investment subsidies amounted to A63 thousand in the first three months of 2018 and
A99 thousand in the first three months of 2019 and relates to (i) subsidies we received in connection with
the construction of our corrugated board production sites in Sch¨uttorf and Pl¨ossberg (both Germany) and
(ii) a A1.3 million KfW repayment grant we were awarded with regard to Facility A under the Existing
Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the proceeds of which we used to fund certain investments that promote
energy efficiency at our paper machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany, all of which we recognize as other
operating income in line with the depreciation of the relevant assets.

(48.0% of sales, or 47.3% of total output), mainly as a result of lower costs of raw materials, consumables
and supplies. The main driver for this decrease was declining prices for recycled paper. Contrary effects
came from a higher quantity of externally purchased containerboard within the growth of our corrugated
board business and a higher average price level for the externally purchased containerboard. See also

The cost of purchased services increased by A1.6 million or 7.0%, from A21.5 million in the first three
months of 2018 to A23.0 million in the first three months of 2019, due to higher costs for freight brokerage
at Logistics (A2.8 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to A3.3 million in the first three
months of 2019) and energy costs (i.e. electricity, gas and steam), which amounted to A14.5 million in the
first three months of 2018 and A16.0 million in the first three months of 2019. Costs for waste water
treatment decreased to A1.7 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to A2.3 million in the first
three months of 2018, while costs for disposal of ash and rejects (A1.9 million in the first three months of
2018 compared to A1.9 million in the first three months of 2019) and other external services purchased
remained broadly stable.

**_Gross profit_**

Gross profit increased by A7.5 million or 6.0%, from A124.0 million (50.8% of sales, or 51.0% of total
output) in the first three months of 2018 to A131.4 million (53.6% of sales, or 52.7% of total output) in the
first three months of 2019. This increase of our gross profit is primarily due to a further strong operating
performance with growth in sales volume of corrugated board.

or 16.9% increase in wages and salaries and a A0.4 million or 12.6% increase in social security and
pensions. These increases were due to an increase in the average number of employees (from 1,064 in the
first three months of 2018 to 1,128 in the first three months of 2019), primarily related to the hiring of new
employees starting in the first quarter of 2019 in connection with the ongoing establishment of our new
corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, and our paper machine project (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany as well as, to a lesser extent, the creation of additional administrative and
Group positions, which reflect the strong growth within the Group.

Other operating expenses increased slightly by A0.1 million or 0.3%, from A42.4 million in the first three
months of 2018 to A42.5 million in the first three months of 2019, mainly due to increases in the expenses
for maintenance and repair and freight expenses, which more than off-set a significant decrease in
extraordinary expenses.

Expenses for maintenance and repair increased significantly by A3.3 million or 43.5%, from A7.6 million in
the first three months of 2018 to A11.0 million in the first three months of 2019, primarily due to the
scheduled downtimes of both our existing paper machines (PM1 and PM2), while freight expenses
increased by A1.7 million or 9.7%, from A17.1 million in the first three months of 2018 to A18.8 million in
the first three months of 2019, due to a higher freight volume and higher freight rates. Rental and leasing
costs increased by A0.3 million or 18.4%, from A1.9 million in the first three months of 2018 to A2.2 million
in the first three months of 2019, expenses for paper machine clothing’s increased by A0.1 million or 8.6%,
expenses from other periods also increased by A0.3 million or 124.8% and legal and consulting fees
increased by A0.5 million or 58.5% from A0.8 million in the first three months of 2018 to A1.2 million in the
first three months of 2019. Finally, ‘‘others’’ increased by A1.3 million or 24.7%, from A5.3 million in the
first three months of 2018 to A6.7 million in the first three months of 2019, primarily due to planned
maintenance shut downs of both our existing paper machines (PM1 and PM2).Extraordinary expenses of
A6.9 million in the first three months of 2018 primarily relate to the expenses we incurred in connection
with the offering of the Existing Notes in March 2018.

Amortization and depreciation expenses increased by A1.5 million or 12.6% from A12.3 million in the first
three months of 2018 to A13.8 million in the first three months of 2019. This increase was primarily due to
(i) amortization charges with regard to our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona,
Italy, which commenced production in March 2018, and our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12)
in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, which commenced production in January 2019, as well as (ii) certain

(1) In response to certain changes to German GAAP with regard to the preparation of financial information for any period
beginning after December 31, 2015, we do not report ‘‘income/(loss) on ordinary activities’’ and ‘‘extraordinary net income/
(loss)’’ separately anymore. As a result, effective as of January 1, 2016, we report as ‘‘other operating income’’ and ‘‘other
operating expenses’’ certain items we would previously have reported as ‘‘extraordinary income’’ and ‘‘extraordinary expenses’’,
as applicable. ‘‘Other operating income’’ for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as presented in the table above includes
A4.0 million we would previously have reported as ‘‘extraordinary income’’. ‘‘Other operating expenses’’ for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 as presented in the table above includes A6.2 million and A7.5 million, respectively, we
would previously have reported as ‘‘extraordinary expenses’’.

(2) Total output (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as the sum of sales, increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in
process, other operating income and other own work capitalized.

(3) Gross profit (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated by deducting cost of materials from total output.

(4) EBITDA (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as sales, plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process,
_plus other operating income (excluding any extraordinary income), plus other own work capitalized, minus costs of materials,_

our reported EBITDA excludes the impact of any ‘‘extraordinary’’ items for all periods presented, it has not yet been adjusted
for ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’.

**_Sales_**

Total sales increased significantly by A161.9 million or 20.1%, from A804.3 million in 2017 to A966.1 million
in 2018. This increase in sales was primarily attributable to a significant increase in corrugated board sales,
both in Germany and abroad, which significantly exceeded general market growth. Total corrugated board
sales increased by A176.0 million or 26.5% in 2018 compared to 2017. Corrugated board sales volumes
increased strongly by approximately 140,000 tons, from approximately 1,011,000 tons in 2017 to
approximately 1,151,000 tons in 2018. This significant increase in sales volumes was attributable to (i) the
successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland following
commencement of commercial production in April 2017, (ii) the successful (but on-going) ramp-up at our
corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, following commencement of commercial
production in March 2018 (iii) our ongoing efforts to improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing
activities as part of our Continuous Improvement Program as well as (iv) our continuing efforts to further
optimize production of our corrugated board plants. See also ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of
_Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ and ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of_
_Operations—Continuous Improvement Program’’ above. At the same time, our total containerboard sales_
volume slightly decreased by approximately 31,000 tons or 3.1%, from approximately 1,018,000 tons in
2017 to approximately 987,000 tons in 2018, primarily due to deliberate build-up of inventories. External
sales of containerboard significantly decreased by approximately 66,000 tons or 27.2% from approximately
242,000 tons in 2017 to approximately 176,000 tons in 2018 as we managed to further increase the share of
internal containerboard sales to our corrugated board operations within Board. This was due to further
improved utilization of our existing corrugated board production sites, the successful ramp-up at our
corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland as well as the successful (but ongoing)
ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy. As a result, the average grade
of integration between Paper and Board, including swap agreements, increased from 87% in 2017 to 93%
in 2018. The average price of corrugated board in 2018 was significantly above the average price of 2017
(+11.1%). During the course of 2017 and the first half of 2018, price level for corrugated board increased
following the recycled containerboard’s price development. The average price per ton for externally sold
containerboard in 2018 was significantly above the average price in 2017 (+16.4%), which also had a
positive impact on our total sales in 2018. After a continuously upward trend during 2017 and the first
quarter of 2018, prices for recycled containerboard were primarily stable in the second and third quarter of
2018 and declined in the fourth quarter of 2018. See also ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of
_Operations—Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input_

2018, primarily due to a A69.0 million or 20.1% increase in corrugated board sales for the reasons
described above. In contrast, external sales of containerboard in Germany decreased by A15.3 million or
15.3%, also for the reasons described above. Other sales in Germany increased by A1.1 million or 2.7%,
primarily as a result of income from external freight brokerage. Corrugated board sales abroad also
increased by A107.1 million or 33.5%, from A320.0 million in 2017 to A427.0 million in 2018 following
strong growth of corrugated board described above.

Total corrugated board sales increased by A176.0 million or 26.5% in 2018 compared to 2017, due to the
A54.8 million increase in sales in Germany and A107.1 million increase in sales abroad. External sales of
containerboard decreased significantly by A15.3 million or 15.3%, from A99.7 million in 2017 to
A84.5 million in 2018, while other sales increased by A1.1 million or 2.7%, from A40.6 million in 2017 to
A41.7 million in 2018. As a result, corrugated board sales as a percentage of total sales further increased
from 82.6% in 2017 to 86.9% in 2018, while containerboard sales as a percentage of total sales further
decreased from 12.4% in 2017 to 8.7% in 2018.

**_Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process_**

Primarily due to higher stocks of containerboard as work in process in 2018, our finished goods and work
in progress increased by A13.1 million in 2018.

**_Other own work capitalised_**

Other own work capitalised in 2017 and 2018 relates to our two new corrugated board production sites
(PW11 and PW12) in Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, as well as the ongoing
establishment of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, and our further
paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.

Other operating income increased slightly by A0.1 million or 0.7% from A17.6 million in 2017 to
A17.7 million in 2018, primarily due to extraordinary income which amounted to A4.0 million in 2018 and
more than off-set significant decreases in income from other periods and income from exchange rate
differences. Extraordinary income in 2018 includes, among other things, a release of provisions for finance
costs and indemnity claims against EnBW in relation to additional tax payments regarding the fiscal year
2013. The income from EnBW relates to certain tax indemnities we received from EnBW in connection
with the CHP Acquisition which cover tax liabilities with regard to periods prior to the acquisition date. We

have recorded a corresponding tax expense under ‘‘income tax’’. Other income also increased by
A0.4 million or 49.5%, from A0.9 million in 2017 to A1.3 million in 2018.

Contrary effects came from lower income from other periods which increased by A0.7 million or 5.6% from
A12.6 million in 2017 to A13.3 million in 2018, primarily due to a different timing of refunds for grid
charges and energy taxes. Income from exchange rate differences also decreased by A1.0 million or 25.5%
from A3.9 million in 2017 to A2.9 million in 2018.

Income from investment subsidies amounted to A0.3 million in 2017 and A0.3 million in 2018 and relates to
subsidies we received in connection with the construction of our corrugated board production sites in
Sch¨uttorf and Pl¨ossberg (both Germany) and the construction of our paper machine in Burg. We recognize
these subsidies as other operating income in line with the depreciation of the relevant assets over a period
of up to 33 years.

Cost of materials increased significantly by A63.2 million or 14.7%, from A430.5 million in 2017 (53.5% of
sales, or 51.6% of total output) to A493.6 million in 2018 (51.1% of sales, or 48.6% of total output), mainly
as a result of a significant increase of A38.4 million or 10.6% in the cost of raw materials, consumables and
supplies as a result of the significant increase in our corrugated board production as described under
_‘‘—Sales’’ above. The increase in costs of materials was significantly below the 20.1% increase in total sales_
in 2018. The price of recycled paper declined between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of
2018 and remained at a comparatively low level for the rest of the year. As a result, our own average costs
per ton for the recycled paper grades we purchased during 2018 were significantly lower (28.0%) compared
to 2017. These considerable lower recycled paper prices and the unchanged production volume resulted in
a decrease of recycled paper costs from A163.1 million in 2017 to A116.4 million in 2018. Costs of raw
materials also include the costs of externally purchased containerboard as raw material for our corrugated
board plants, which significantly rose from A160.5 million in 2017 to A246.4 million in 2018. This increase
was attributable to significantly higher production and sales volumes of corrugated board, higher average
purchase prices for external containerboard and a higher quantity of externally sourced containerboard.
See also ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement
_in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input Costs—Fluctuations in Raw Material Costs’’ above._

The cost of purchased services also increased significantly by A24.7 million or 35.9%, from A68.8 million in
2017 to A93.6 million in 2018, due to the reclassification of costs for waste water treatment from other
operating expenses to cost of materials. These costs amounted to A5.8 million in 2017 and A14.2 million in
2018. The significant increase in costs of waste water treatment resulted from provisions for potential
exceptional charges for waste water treatment in 2018.

Energy costs (i.e. electricity, gas and steam) increased significantly from A50.5 million in 2017 to
A60.3 million in 2018 due to higher prices for energy consumption and power network charges, in
particular at our two existing paper machines (PM1 and PM2). Costs for freight brokerage at Logistics
increased from A10.3 million in 2017 to A11.5 million in 2018.

**_Gross profit_**

Gross profit increased by A116.8 million or 28.9%, from A404.3 million (50.3% of sales, or 48.4% of total
output) in 2017 to A521.1 million (53.9% of sales, or 51.4% of total output) in 2018. This increase of our
gross profit is primarily due to the increase in sales volumes of corrugated board and higher margins in
both our containerboard and corrugated board businesses.

Personnel expenses in 2018 increased by A10.6 million or 15.5%, from A68.3 million in 2017 to A78.9 million
in 2018, reflecting a A9.2 million or 15.9% increase in wages and salaries and a A1.4 million or 13.5%
increase in social security and pensions. These increases were due to (i) a 5.4% increase in the average
number of employees (from 1,040 in 2017 to 1,096 in 2018), primarily related in the hiring of new
employees in connection with the launch and subsequent ramp-up at our corrugated board production site
(PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, starting in the third quarter of 2017, and the creation of additional
administrative and Group positions, which reflect the strong growth within the Group, as well as
(ii) regular annual salary and wage increases.

Other operating expenses increased by A8.4 million or 5.2%, from A160.4 million in 2017 to A168.8 million
in 2018. Freight expenses increased by A5.3 million or 8.6%, from A61.7 million in 2017 to A67.0 million,
mainly due to increased freight volumes as a result of our increased sales volume of corrugated board. In
addition, expenses for maintenance and repair increased by A3.8 million or 9.3%, from A41.4 million in
2017 to A45.2 million in 2018, primarily due to the replacement of the sizer at our paper machine PM1 and
some higher maintenance costs at our corrugated board plants.

Legal and consulting fees increased by A1.5 million or 57.2%, from A2.6 million in 2017 to A4.0 million in
2018, primarily due to consulting costs for supporting organizational change. The A1.3 million or 20.1%
increase in extraordinary expenses, from A6.2 million in 2017 to A7.5 million in 2018, primarily relates to
expenses we incurred in connection with the issuance of the Existing Notes in March 2018 and the
negotiation and execution, in the third quarter of 2018, of Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB
Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB
Facility to finance a portion of our paper machine project (PM3) at Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.
Expenses from exchange rate differences increased by A1.2 million or 36.7%, from A3.3 million in 2017 to
A4.6 million in 2018. Rental and leasing costs increased by A1.2 million or 18.2%, from A6.6 million in 2017
to A7.8 million in 2018, primarily due to rental costs for the building housing our new corrugated board
production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy.

These increases more than offset the decreases in other expenses, expenses from other periods and
expenses for paper machine clothing’s. Other expenses significantly decreased by A5.1 million or 17.0%,
from A30.1 million in 2017 to A25.0 million in 2018, mainly due to the reclassification of costs for waste
water treatment from other operating expenses to costs of materials. Expenses from other periods
decreased by A0.6 million or 30.1%, from A1.9 million in 2017 to A1.4 million in 2018. Expenses for paper
machine clothing’s decreased by A0.2 million or 3.3%, from A6.6 million in 2017 to A6.3 million in 2018.

(1) EBITDA (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as sales, plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process,
_plus other operating income (excluding any extraordinary income), plus other own work capitalized, minus costs of materials,_
_minus personnel expenses,_ _minus other operating expenses (excluding any extraordinary expenses),_ _minus other taxes. While_
our reported EBITDA therefore excludes the impact of any ‘‘extraordinary’’ items for all periods presented, it has not yet been
adjusted for ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’.

Our EBITDA increased significantly by A95.1 million or 52.7% from A180.4 million in 2017 (22.4% of
sales) to an exceptional A275.5 million in 2018 (28.5% of sales), as a result of the factors described above,

Total taxes increased significantly by A26.8 million or 90.9%, from A29.5 million in 2017 to A56.3 million in
2018. Total taxes mainly include trade tax and corporate income tax for the current financial year.
Furthermore, total taxes include deferred payments of trade tax and corporate tax for previous years,
which amounted to A3.0 million in 2018 and expenses arising from the adjustment of deferred tax assets,
which amounted to A0.8 million in 2018. Taxes on income also include tax expenses for prior years at
Progroup Power 1 GmbH in an amount of A2.7 million. This tax expense is the result of a tax audit for the
years prior to the CHP Acquisition. Pursuant to certain tax indemnity provisions, EnBW was required to
compensate us for such historic tax liabilities, and we have recorded the related indemnification payments
under ‘‘other operating income’’ as described above.

(1) In response to certain changes to German GAAP with regard to the preparation of financial information for any period
beginning after December 31, 2015, we do not report ‘‘income/(loss) on ordinary activities’’ and ‘‘extraordinary net income/
(loss)’’ separately anymore. As a result, effective as of January 1, 2016, we report as ‘‘other operating income’’ and ‘‘other
operating expenses’’ certain items we would previously have reported as ‘‘extraordinary income’’ and ‘‘extraordinary expenses’’,
as applicable. ‘‘Other operating expenses’’ for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 as presented in the table
above includes A0.9 million and A6.2 million, respectively, we would previously have reported as ‘‘extraordinary expenses’’.

(2) Total output (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as the sum of sales, increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in
process, other operating income and other own work capitalized.

(3) Gross profit (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated by deducting cost of materials from total output.

(4) EBITDA (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as sales, plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process,
_plus other operating income (excluding any extraordinary income), plus other own work capitalized, minus costs of materials,_
_minus personnel expenses,_ _minus other operating expenses (excluding any extraordinary expenses),_ _minus other taxes. While_
our reported EBITDA therefore excludes the impact of any ‘‘extraordinary’’ items for all periods presented, it has not yet been
adjusted for ‘‘items of exceptional size or incidence’’. Excluding the negative effect of A16.0 million in ‘‘items of exceptional size
or incidence’’ (including A13.9 million in additional costs as expenditure of exceptional size or incidence and A2.1 million in lost
sales) related to a longer than scheduled shutdown of the CHP in 2016, our EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2016 would have been A170.7 million.

**_Sales_**

Total sales increased significantly by A71.0 million or 9.7%, from A733.2 million in 2016 to A804.3 million in
2017 due to further strong growth of our corrugated board sales as a result of both higher sales volumes
and higher average price levels in 2017 compared to 2016. Total corrugated board sales increased by
A74.7 million or 12.7% in 2017 compared to 2016, significantly in excess of general market growth.
Corrugated board sales volumes increased by approximately 81,000 tons, from approximately 930,000 tons
in 2016 to approximately 1,011,000 tons in 2017. This significant increase in sales volumes was attributable
to (i) the successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany during

96


-----

2016 and 2017 following commencement of commercial production in October 2015, (ii) the quick and
successful (but ongoing) ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland
following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, (iii) our ongoing efforts to improve the
effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities as part of our Continuous Improvement Program as well
as (iv) our continuing efforts to further optimize production of our Board plants. See also ‘‘—Key Factors
_Affecting our Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ above. Our total_
containerboard sales volume decreased by approximately 24,000 tons or 2.3%, from approximately
1,042,000 tons in 2016 to approximately 1,018,000 tons in 2017, primarily due to capacity constraints
imposed on the operation of our paper machine (PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt as a result of certain technical
limitations of the local waste water treatment plant. The trend towards lighter containerboard impacted
the production program of PM2 and led to a substitution of standard weight grades through super-lightweight containerboard. The lower output of super-light-weight containerboard in tons per hour is in
general offset by higher sales prices. External sales of containerboard decreased by approximately 62,000
tons or 20.4% from approximately 304,000 tons in 2016 to approximately 242,000 tons in 2017 as we
managed to further increase the share of internal containerboard sales to Board through further improved
utilization of our existing corrugated board production sites, the successful ramp-up at our corrugated
board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany as well as the quick and successful (but ongoing)
ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland. During the course of 2017,
price levels for both corrugated board and containerboard increased significantly, which also had a positive
impact on our total sales in 2017. See also ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—Cyclical
_Nature of our Industry and Movement in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input Costs—Fluctuations in Raw_
_Material Costs’’ above._

In 2017, sales in Germany accounted for 60.2% of total sales compared to 62.1% of total sales in 2016.
Sales in Germany increased by A28.9 million or 6.4%, from A455.4 million in 2016 to A484.3 million in 2017,
primarily due to a A32.6 million or 10.5% increase in corrugated board sales for the reasons described
above. External sales of containerboard in Germany decreased by A14.5 million or 12.7%, and other sales
in Germany increased by A10.9 million or 36.6%, primarily as a result of sales of electricity produced by the
CHP. Corrugated board sales abroad also increased by A42.1 million or 15.2%, from A277.9 million in 2016
to A320.0 million in 2017 for the reasons described above.

Total corrugated board sales increased by A74.7 million or 12.7% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to the
A32.6 million increase in sales in Germany and A42.1 million increase in sales abroad. External sales of
containerboard decreased by A14.5 million or 12.7%, from A114.3 million in 2016 to A99.7 million in 2017,
while other sales increased by A10.9 million or 36.6%, from A29.7 million in 2016 to A40.6 million in 2017.
Increased sales of electricity produced by the CHP, which were negatively affected by the longer than
scheduled CHP shutdown in 2016, also contributed to the increase in other sales. As a result, corrugated
board sales as a percentage of total sales further increased from 80.4% in 2016 to 82.6% in 2017, while
containerboard sales as a percentage of total sales further decreased from 15.6% in 2016 to 12.4% in 2017.

**_Increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process_**

Primarily due to higher stocks of containerboard as work in process in 2017, our finished goods and work
in progress increased by A10.3 million in 2017.

Other operating income increased by A2.9 million or 19.6% from A14.7 million in 2016 to A17.6 million in
2017, mainly as a result of higher income from exchange rate differences which increased by A2.0 million or
104.7%, from A1.9 million in 2016 to A3.9 million in 2017. Income from other periods also increased by
A1.4 million or 12.2%, from A11.2 million in 2016 to A12.6 million in 2017, primarily due to a different
timing of refunds for grid charges and energy taxes.

Income from investment subsidies amounted to A0.3 million in 2016 and A0.3 million in 2017 and relates to
subsidies we received in connection with the construction of our corrugated board production sites in
Sch¨uttorf and Pl¨ossberg (both Germany) and which we recognize as other operating income in line with
the depreciation of the relevant assets over a period of up to 33 years.

Cost of materials increased significantly by A58.9 million or 15.9%, from A371.6 million in 2016 (50.7% of
sales, or 50.0% of total output) to A430.5 million in 2017 (53.5% of sales, or 51.6% of total output), mainly
as a result of a significant increase in the cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies. The main drivers
for this increase were predominantly volume based higher costs for externally purchased containerboard,
both of a result of the increase in corrugated board sales volumes and higher containerboard prices, and
significantly higher prices for recycled paper. See also ‘‘—Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations—
_Cyclical Nature of our Industry and Movement in Market Prices, Raw Materials and Input Costs—Fluctuations_
_in Raw Material Costs’’ above._

The cost of purchased services also increased significantly by A6.9 million or 11.2%, from A61.9 million in
2016 to A68.8 million in 2017, due to the reclassification (in 2017 only) of costs for disposal of ash and

rejects from cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies to cost of purchased services to. These costs
amounted to A6.8 million in 2016 and A7.8 million in 2017.

Costs for freight brokerage at Logistics (A10.3 million in 2017 compared to A10.1 million in 2016) and
energy costs (i.e. electricity, gas and steam), which amounted to A50.5 million in 2017 and A50.5 million in
2016, remained largely stable, while other external services purchased decreased to A0.1 million in 2017
compared to A1.3 million in 2016, due to the reclassification (in 2017 only) of the cost of services for
cleaning and surveillance to other operating costs.

**_Gross profit_**

Gross profit increased by A33.4 million or 9.0%, from A371.0 million (50.6% of sales, or 50.0% of total
output) in 2016 to A404.3 million (50.3% of sales, or 48.4% of total output) in 2017. This increase of our
gross profit is primarily due to the increase in sales volumes of corrugated board and higher margins in
both our containerboard and corrugated board business.

Personnel expenses in 2017 increased by A6.9 million or 11.2%, from A61.4 million in 2016 to A68.3 million
in 2017, reflecting a A5.7 million or 10.8% increase in wages and salaries and a A1.2 million or 14.1%
increase in social security and pensions. These increases were due to (i) a 6.3% increase in the average
number of employees (from 978 in 2016 to 1,040 in 2017), primarily related in the hiring of new employees
in connection with the launch and subsequent ramp-up at our corrugated board production sites PW10 and
PW11 in Trzcinica, Poland and Drizzona, Italy and a slight increase in the number of overhead group
positions and (ii) regular annual salary and wage increases.

number of employees related primarily to the launch and subsequent ramp-up at our corrugated board
production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland and the hiring of new employees for our new corrugated board
production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy.

Other operating expenses increased slightly by A6.1 million or 4.0%, from A154.3 million in 2016 to
A160.4 million in 2017, mainly due to significantly higher extraordinary expenses, partly offset by
significantly lower expenses for maintenance and repair.

In connection with the implementation of the changes introduced by the BilRUG, we were required to
report as other operating expenses those items we previously reported under a separate line item as
‘‘extraordinary expenses’’ in prior periods. See also ‘‘—Key Income Statement Items—Other Operating
_Expenses’’ above. Extraordinary expenses significantly increased by_ A5.3 million or 577.5%, from
A0.9 million in 2016 to A6.2 million in 2017, primarily as a result of extraordinary expenses we incurred in
connection with the offering of the Floating Rate Notes in March 2017 and in connection with the
amendments of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities
and the entry into the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility
in December 2017.

Water and waste water treatment expenses increased by A1.2 million or 19.5%, from A6.0 million in 2016 to
A7.2 million in 2017, mainly due to higher fees for waste water treatment at our paper machine (PM2) in
Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany. Freight expenses increased slightly by A0.5 million or 0.8%, from A61.2 million
in 2016 to A61.7 million in 2017, due to the higher sales volume. Rental and leasing costs increased slightly
by A0.2 million or 3.6%, from A6.4 million in 2016 to A6.6 million in 2017 and expenses for paper machine
clothings increased by A0.8 million or 14.2%, due to higher requirements to replace paper machine
clothings at our paper machine (PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany. Finally, ‘‘others’’ increased by
A4.4 million or 23.6%, from A18.5 million in 2016 to A22.9 million in 2017, primarily due to (i) the
reclassification (in 2017 only) of the cost of services for cleaning and surveillance as ‘‘other operating
expenses’’ from ‘‘costs of purchased services’’ within ‘‘cost of materials’’ and (ii) costs incurred in
connection with our 25-year anniversary.

Expenses for maintenance and repair decreased by A5.5 million or 11.7%, from A46.9 million in 2016 to
A41.4 million in 2017, primarily due to the longer than scheduled maintenance shutdown of the CHP in
2016, while expenses from other periods decreased by A0.6 million or 24.1%, mainly due to scrapping of
fixed assets. Legal and consulting fees also decreased by A0.1 million or 3.8% from A2.7 million in 2016 to
A2.6 million in 2017.

(1) EBITDA (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as sales, plus increase/(decrease) in finished goods and work in process,
_plus other operating income (excluding any extraordinary income), plus other own work capitalized, minus costs of materials,_
_minus personnel expenses,_ _minus other operating expenses (excluding any extraordinary expenses),_ _minus other taxes. While_
our reported EBITDA therefore excludes the impact of any ‘‘extraordinary’’ items for all periods presented, it has not yet been

Our EBITDA increased by A25.7 million or 16.6% from A154.7 million in 2016 (21.1% of sales) to
A180.4 million in 2017 (22.4% of sales), as a result of the factors described above. Excluding the negative

scheduled shutdown of the CHP in 2016, our EBITDA for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 would
have been A170.7 million (23.2% of sales).

Amortization and depreciation expenses increased by A2.7 million or 5.6% from A47.4 million in 2016 to
A50.0 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to (i) amortization charges with regard to our
corrugated production site in (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland (which commenced production in April 2017),
(ii) one-off amortization charges we recognized on parts of a used corrugator we were not able to use (as
originally planned) in connection with the establishment of our new corrugated board production site
(PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, as well as (iii) certain maintenance capital expenditure in 2017.

Our net interest expense in 2017 decreased by A1.6 million or 6.3% from net expenses of A25.2 million in
2016 to net expenses of A23.6 million in 2017. This decrease was almost entirely due to a decrease in
interest and similar expenses by A1.7 million or 6.5% from A25.3 million in 2016 to A23.7 million in 2017,
due to lower average interest rates and notwithstanding higher average gross debt in 2017 than in 2016.
Liabilities represented by bonds and bank loans were A495 million and A42.5 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2017 compared to liabilities represented by bonds and bank loans of A420 million and
A26.3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.

which amounted to A8 thousand in 2017 and expenses arising from the adjustment of deferred tax assets,
which amounted to A4.2 million in 2017.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

**Overview**

Our primary sources of financing are cash generated from our operating activities, the Existing Notes, the
Additional Notes and drawings under the Senior Secured Facilities. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB
Facility, Facility A of the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured
HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Facilities remain undrawn. In addition, we have undrawn
capacity of A50 million under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility as of the date of this offering
memorandum. Our cash requirements consist mainly of debt and tax servicing requirements, the purchase
of raw materials, energy and freight, working capital, personnel expenses and capital expenditures.

As of March 31, 2019, we had total financial debt (calculated as bank loans plus finance leases plus bonds,
including the Existing Notes) of A702.0 million compared to A674.0 million as of December 31, 2018,
A537.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and A455.3 million as of December 31, 2016. As of March 31, 2019,
we had cash-in-hand, bank balances in the amount of A136.0 million and net financial debt of
A566.0 million (calculated as total financial debt less cash-in-hand, bank balances). We drew the remaining
GBP67 million of available commitments under the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility during the
course of May 2019. As a result, as of the date of this offering memorandum, the GBP70 million Existing
Senior Secured GBP Facility was fully drawn.

Our ability to generate cash from our operating activities depends on our future operating performance,
which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory
and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed under ‘‘Risk
_Factors’’. In addition, our ability to draw under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will only be_
available if, among other things, we meet the financial covenant set out therein. See ‘‘Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility’’._

102


-----

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operating activities, capacity under the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility, future drawings under Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB
Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, Facility A of the Existing Senior Secured
Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Facilities
and cash-in-hand, bank balances, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs,
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that
future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our
debts when due, including the Additional Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

   - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a decrease of operating profit from our operations, which
could be the result of a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole;

  - the failure or delay of our customers to make payments due to us;

  - risks associated with our expansion and other investment projects, in particular our new paper
machine project;

  - the failure to realize the expected benefits from our Continuous Improvement Program and from
further future optimization initiatives;

   - the failure to further maintain a lean cost structure;

   - the failure to execute capacity expansion projects successfully;

  - any significant unplanned downtime of one or more of our production facilities and/or the CHP
adjacent to our paper mill (PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt;

   - a failure to maintain low working capital requirements;

   - currency exchange rate fluctuations;

   - an increase in variable interest payments or taxes; and

  - the need to fund capacity expansion, unexpected replacement capital expenditures and other
development capital expenditures.

If our future cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources (including borrowings under
our current or any future credit facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund
our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

   - sell certain of our assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

   - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Additional Notes, on or before
maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities, the New Senior Secured Facilities, the Additional Notes and
any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

_Cash flow from operating activities_

In the three-month period ended March 31, 2019, our cash flow from operating activities increased by
A0.9 million from A31.2 million in the first three months of 2018 to A32.1 million in the first three months of

104


-----

2019. This increase follows our strong performance and a lower increase in working capital compared to
previous year’s first quarter. Contrary effects related to the absence of expenditure of exceptional size or
incidence in the reporting period compared to the first quarter in 2018. Furthermore, higher income taxes
paid impacted cash flows from operating activities.

In 2018, our cash flow from operating activities increased by A74.5 million from A122.7 million in 2017 to
A197.2 million in 2018. The increase in our cash flow from operating activities was primarily attributable to
our improved EBITDA as a result of our strong operational performance. Contrary effects resulted from a
A55.3 million increase in our trade working capital, from A114.2 million as at December 31, 2017 to
A169.5 million as at December 31, 2018, as described in more detail below.

In 2017, our cash flow from operating activities decreased by A29.9 million from A152.6 million in 2016 to
A122.7 million in 2017, notwithstanding the significant increase in our net income for the period from
A61.4 million in 2016 to A72.4 million in 2017. The decrease in our cash flow from operating activities was
primarily attributable to the significant increase in our trade working capital, both as a result of a
significant increase in inventories, trade receivables and other assets (not attributable to investing or
financing activities) and a significant decrease in trade payables and other liabilities (not attributable to
investing or financing activities), for the reasons discussed below. A significant increase in income taxes
paid (from A10.6 million in 2016 to A17.9 million in 2017), due to higher net income in 2017 and a lower
amount of tax loss carry-forwards available to off-set our net income, also contributed to the decrease in
our cash flow from operating activities in 2017.

Our cash flow from operating activities is significantly affected by changes in our net working capital. As a
result, our cash flow from operating activities can be significantly affected by changes in raw material prices
or an increase or decrease of sales volumes as well as payment terms, as those factors affect the amount of
inventories, trade receivables and trade payables. The following table sets forth our net working capital as
of the dates indicated:

(1) Trade working capital (not a German GAAP measure) we define as trade receivables plus inventories, minus trade payables.

We record a liability under trade payables only if we have received the related supplier invoice by the
relevant balance sheet date and provided that all other prerequisites for the recognition as a liability have
been met. We record liabilities related to goods or services we have received during the relevant period,
but for which we have not yet received an invoice, under other provisions on our balance sheet. These
provisions for outstanding invoices amounted to A20.6 million, A22.1 million and A26.3 million as of
December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and A33.1 million as of March 31, 2019, respectively.

In the first three months of 2019, our trade working capital increased by A12.3 million, or 7.3%, from
A169.5 million as of December 31, 2018 to A181.8 million as of March 31, 2019. Trade receivables increased
by A19.5 million, or 17.9%, from A108.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to A128.2 million as of March 31,
2019, mainly due to year-end effects based on lower sales in December. At the same time, the amount of
trade payables increased by A4.6 million, or 9.3%, from A49.8 million as of December 31, 2018 to
A54.4 million as of March 31, 2019. This increase is primarily related to a higher external containerboard
purchases to cover the raw material demand of our growing corrugated board business and our ongoing
expansion projects.

In 2018, our trade working capital increased by A55.3 million, or 48.4%, from A114.2 million as of
December 31, 2017 to A169.5 million as of December 31, 2018, following the increase in our total output,
as well as in the amount of income taxes paid. The increase in our trade working capital is attributable to

105


-----

(i) a significant increase in our trade receivables, (ii) a significant increase in our inventories and a slight
decrease in our trade payables. Trade receivables increased by A29.9 million, or 37.9%, from A78.9 million
as of December 31, 2017 to A108.8 million as of December 31, 2018 following our sales growth especially in
countries with longer than average payment terms and as a result of a lower forfaiting volume in the fiscal
year 2018 due to an already high cash position. The significant increase of A23.6 million, or 27.2%, in
inventories from A86.9 million as of December 31, 2017 to A110.5 million is mainly driven by an increase in
work in process by A22.5 million as a result of higher volume of stocks at our paper machines and higher
volume of stocks of internal purchased containerboard at our corrugated board plants. Furthermore, a
higher amount of spare parts led to an increase in raw materials, consumables and supplies. At the same
time, the amount of trade payables decreased slightly by A1.7 million, or 3.5%, from A51.5 million as of
December 31, 2017 to A49.8 million as of December 31, 2018 due to one-off effects as a result of reporting
date factors.

In 2017, our trade working capital increased significantly by A38.7 million or 51.3% from A75.5 million as of
December 31, 2016 to A114.2 million as of December 31, 2017, notwithstanding the increase in our total
output in 2017 of only 12.4%. Trade receivables increased by A19.3 million or 32.4% from A59.6 million as
of December 31, 2016 to A78.9 million as of December 31, 2017 due to (i) significantly higher sales volumes
towards year end 2017 compared to year end 2016, mainly as a result of our corrugated board production
site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany completing its ramp-up phase in 2017 and the fast ramp-up of our
corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland during 2017, following commencement of
commercial production in April 2017, as well as (ii) significantly higher prices for our corrugated board
products at year end 2017 compared to year end 2016, and (iii) timing effects at year end 2016 and 2017.
Inventories also increased significantly by A12.9 million or 17.5% from A73.9 million as of December 31,
2016 to A86.9 million as of December 31, 2017, mostly as a result of a A9.3 million or 50.4% increase in
work in process from A18.4 million as of December 31. 2016 to A27.7 million as of December 31, 2017. This
increase in work in process as of yearend 2017 relates to (i) our additional corrugated board production
site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, which commenced production in April 2017 as well as (ii) a planned
extended maintenance shutdown of our paper machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany. In anticipation of this
planned shutdown, we already started to increase stock levels of the relevant containerboard grades
produced by our paper machine (PM1) to be able to continue to meet the relevant containerboard
sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production during the planned extended shutdown.
Inventories of finished products also increased by A1.0 million or 25.3% from A4.0 million as of
December 31, 2016 to A5.1 million as of December 31, 2017, both as a result of the higher volume of
finished goods and the increase in the price for our finished goods at year end 2017. At the same time, the
amount of trade payables decreased significantly by A6.5 million or 11.2% from A58.0 million as of
December 31, 2016 to A51.5 million as of December 31, 2017, notwithstanding a significant increase in our
raw material sourcing requirements in 2017 due to the increase in our corrugated board production and
significantly higher prices for recycled paper and recycled containerboard in 2017 compared to 2016. The
lower amount of trade payables at year end 2017 was primarily due to a high amount of trade payables as
of December 31, 2016 related to the construction of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in
Trzcinica, Poland.

_Cash flow from investing activities_

Cash flows from investing activities generally consist of cash outflows for investments in tangible and
intangible fixed assets as well as cash inflows from the disposal of fixed assets as well as interest received
concerning financial assets and cash in hand.

In the first three months of 2019, our cash outflow from investing activities increased by A52.2 million, or
278.9%, from A18.7 million in the first three months of 2018 to A70.9 million in the first three months of
2019. This increase was primarily due to the start of skeleton construction works for our new paper
machine project (PM3) as well as investments into our corrugated board plants (PW12 and PW13) in
Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and Eisfeld, Germany, each as described in more detail below. Smaller
investments in different plants as part of our continuous maintenance capital expenditures also contributed
to the overall increase.

In 2018, our cash outflows from investing activities significantly increased by A111.2 million, or 233.0%,
from A47.7 million in 2017 to A158.9 million in 2018. These cash outflows related to capital expenditures in
connection with our new paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, our new
corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, our corrugated board project
(PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, the replacement of the sizer at our paper machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany,

our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy and the extension of our existing
corrugated board plant (PW6) in Offenbach, Germany, each as described in more detail below.
Furthermore, we have made several smaller investments in our other existing production sites as part of
our continuous maintenance capital expenditures. As a result, investments in tangible fixed assets
significantly increased by A111.2 million from A47.8 million in 2017 to A159.0 million in 2018.

In 2017, our cash outflows from investing activities increased by A24.5 million or 105.7%, from
A23.2 million in 2016 to A47.7 million in 2017. This is due to the higher cash outflows due to payments to
acquire tangible fixed assets related to the establishment of our corrugated board production sites (PW10,
PW11 and PW12) in Trzcinica, Poland, Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom in 2017. Cash
outflows from investing activities in 2016 primarily related to cash outflows due to payments to acquire
tangible fixed assets in connection with the establishment of our corrugated board production site (PW10)
in Trzcinica, Poland.

We primarily finance our maintenance capital expenditures with cash flow from operating activities. From
time to time, we have also financed our expansion capital expenditures through borrowings. The following
table sets forth our capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2019:

As discussed in more detail under ‘‘Business—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a
_leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled investments’’ and ‘‘—Key Factors_
_Affecting our Results of Operations—Expansion Projects and Investment Program’’ above, our strategy_
involves significant additional investments to further expand both our corrugated board and
containerboard production capacities.

In the first three months of 2019, capital expenditures increased significantly by A52.2 million, or 278.8%,
from A18.7 million in the first three months of 2018 to A70.9 million in the first three months of 2019,
primarily due to (i) A53.1 million of capital expenditures in connection with the start of skeleton
construction works for our new paper machine (PM3) and (ii) A3.1 million and A6.0 million of capital
expenditures related to our corrugated board plant projects (PW12 and PW13) in Ellesmere Port, United
Kingdom and Eisfeld, Germany, respectively.

Capital expenditures of A159.4 million in 2018 primarily relate to (i) A63.6 million of capital expenditures in
connection with the start of construction works for our new paper machine project (PM3) in SandersdorfBrehna, Germany, (ii) A54.0 million of capital expenditures in connection with the establishment of our
new corrugated board production ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (which
commenced production in January 2019), (iii) A9.4 million of capital expenditures in connection with the
start of construction works for our new corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany,
(iv) A7.3 million of capital expenditures in connection with the replacement of the sizer at our paper
machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany and (v) A3.4 million of capital expenditures in connection with the
extension of our existing corrugated board plant (PW6) in Offenbach, Germany.

Capital expenditures of A47.9 million in 2017 primarily reflect (i) A16.0 million of capital expenditures in
connection with the establishment of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland
(which commenced production in April 2017), (ii) A8.5 million in 2017 of capital expenditures in
connection with the establishment of our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy
(which commenced production in early March 2018) and (iii) A11.6 million of capital expenditures in
connection with the ongoing construction of our corrugated board production site (PW12) in Ellesmere
Port, United Kingdom (following the start of construction in October 2017).

107


-----

Payments of capital expenditures of A23.4 million in 2016 primarily relate to our A22.1 million investment
in connection with the establishment of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland,
on land we purchased from our large customer Janmar Centum adjacent to its existing packaging plant.

_Free cash flow_

We define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less cash outflows from investing activities.
Free cash flow comprises the cash surplus or deficit after expenditure on investments and taxes but before
net cash used in/provided by financing activities, and before taking into account cash proceeds and
payments relating to shareholders’ equity and financial liabilities. The reasons for changes in the free cash
flow are therefore the same as explained above. In the first three months of 2019, our free cash flow
decreased by A51.3 million from a cash inflow of A12.5 million in the first three months of 2018 to a cash
outflow of A38.8 million in the first three months of 2019. In 2018, our free cash flow decreased by
A36.7 million from a cash inflow of A75.0 million in 2017 to a cash inflow of A38.3 million in 2018. In 2017,
our free cash flow decreased by A54.4 million from a cash inflow of A129.4 million in 2016 to a cash inflow
of A75.0 million in 2017.

_Cash flow from financing activities_

In the first three months of 2019, we reported a cash inflow from financing activities of A25.9 million,
compared to a cash inflow of A423.3 million in the first three months of 2018. Cash flows from financing
activities in the first three months of 2019 mainly related to A30 million of drawings under the Existing
Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities to finance the ongoing construction of our new paper machine
(PM3) and interest paid as well as scheduled repayments under the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities.
The high cash inflows of A423.3 million in the first three months of 2018 primarily relates to the issuance of
the Existing Notes in March 2018, with the majority of the proceeds only used in May 2018 to redeem the
Issuer’s A345,000,000 5.125% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2022.

In 2018, we reported a cash outflow from financing activities of A6.3 million, mainly as a result of (i) the
A352.9 million repayment of bonds and borrowings, which related to the redemption of the Issuer’s
A345,000,000 5.125% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2022 on May 1, 2018 and scheduled repayments
under the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities (A7.9 million), (ii) a A86.5 million special dividend
payment to JH-Holding and our minority shareholders for the purpose of enabling JH-Holding to redeem
all of its then-remaining A81.1 million outstanding principal amount of its PIK toggle notes on June 1,
2018, (iii) A50.1 million of interest paid, including interest payments under the Issuer’s senior secured notes
as well as bank loans and lump sum fee payments (A19.3 million) to JH-Holding and our minority
shareholders in return for granting security over their shares in the Issuer to secure our obligations under
our various financing arrangements, as well as (iv) A8.7 million of cash outflows related to payments
relating to expenditure of exceptional size or incidence due to extraordinary expenses (transaction costs,
advisory and professional fees and others) we incurred in connection with the issuance of the Existing
Notes in March 2018 and the negotiation and execution, in the third quarter of 2018, of Facility C of the
Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing
Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility to finance a portion of our
paper machine project (PM3) at Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. These cash outflows from financing
activities more than offset cash inflows in 2018 relating to proceeds of bonds and borrowings of
A490.6 million, including (i) A450 million from the offering of the Existing Notes in March 2018,
(ii) A38.5 million of borrowings under the Facility A and the Facility B under the Existing Senior Secured
IKB Facilities and (iii) GBP3 million (carrying amount as of December 31, 2018: A3.5 million) of
borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility. The amount repayable under Facility A under
the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities was subsequently reduced from A8.5 million to A7.2 million as of
December 31, 2018 a result of a A1.3 million KfW repayment grant, which we reported as proceeds from
grants received in 2018.

In 2017, we reported a cash inflow from financing activities of A3.8 million, mainly as a result of (i) the
excess proceeds from the A150 million aggregate principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes due 2024
issued in March 2017, after application of a portion of the proceeds to redeem A75 million aggregate
principal amount of the Issuer’s senior secured floating rate notes due 2022 and payment of costs, fees and
expenses for the offering and (ii) PLN 92.0 million of drawings under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN
Facility in 2017 in connection with the completion of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in
Trzcinica, Poland. These cash inflows from financing activities more than offset (i) A57.5 million in
dividends distributed to our shareholders, including a A55.0 million special dividend in April 2017, which

108


-----

enabled JH-Holding, together with cash-in-hand, bank balances, to purchase A43.9 million aggregate
principal amount of the PIK Toggle Notes in a tender offer and subsequently transfer such PIK Toggle
Notes to JH-Holding Finance SA for cancellation, (ii) A8.9 million of payments in relation to a former
finance lease agreement for the corrugator at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg,
Germany, including A1.5 million in regular payments during the course of 2017 and A7.4 million in
payments upon termination of the financing lease agreement in December 2017, as well as (iii) PLN
36.4 million in scheduled repayments under the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities.

In 2016, we reported a cash outflow from financing activities of A110.3 million as a result of the early
optional redemption of A75.0 million in principal amount of the Floating Rate Notes, A26.5 million in
interest payments and A6.2 million in dividends distributed to our shareholders.

**Liquidity management**

While we intend to primarily meet our liquidity requirements with cash generated from our operating
activities and drawings under Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior
Secured SaarLB Facility, Facility A of the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing
Senior Secured HSBC Facility and the New Senior Secured Facilities, we expect to have sufficient capacity
available under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility to be able to meet any additional operating
requirements. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we have undrawn capacity of A50 million under
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

Facility C of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility,
Facility A of the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC
Facility will remain undrawn on the date of this offering memorandum. We may utilize the A25.0 million
Facility C under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the A25.0 million Existing Senior Secured
SaarLB Facility and the A45.0 million Facility A under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities
until August 10, 2019. For more details about the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing

Senior Secured HSBC Facility until one month before December 31, 2023. For more details about the
Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing
_Senior Secured HSBC Facility’’._

The utilization of the New Senior Secured Facilities is subject to certain conditions precedent. We expect
to satisfy all remaining conditions precedent on or around the issue date of the Additional Notes. As a
result, the New Senior Secured Facilities will remain undrawn on the issue date of the Additional Notes.
We may utilize the A30 million, A30 million and A15 million under the New Senior Secured Erste Bank
Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility until June,
2021, May, 2020 and May, 2020, respectively. For more details about the New Senior Secured Facilities, see
‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility’’, ‘‘Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain_
_Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’._

To manage our liquidity, we maintain a largely centralized cash management system, which includes all our
subsidiaries. In particular, liquidity plans are prepared with the Group budget on a monthly rolling period
for the upcoming 12 months in which the expected cash receipts and payments for the specified time
period are set off against each other. The upcoming four weeks are planned two times per month and
include a deviation analysis.

**OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS**

The following discussion describes our material off-balance sheet arrangements.

**Forfaiting Program**

Our subsidiary Progroup Board GmbH finances a portion of its trade receivables through an off balance
sheet forfaiting program with CommerzFactoring GmbH. Under the forfaiting program it sells trade
receivables to CommerzFactoring GmbH on a non recourse basis in return for immediate cash payments.
The forfaiting transactions occur up to a maximum aggregate transaction volume of A15 million. As of
March 31, 2019, no trade receivables were sold under the forfaiting program.

of December 31, 2018, the minimum amount of undiscounted future payments under operating leases and
for other financial obligations (total payment obligations) were as follows:

**As of December 31, 2018**

**(E in thousands)**
Operating leases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,239

**Total payment obligations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** 295,823

We lease forklifts and trucks pursuant to operating leases that are not recorded on our balance sheet.
These operating leases typically have a term of between three and six years, and the total remaining
payment obligations under those leases amounted to A8.2 million as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we
have entered into leasing agreements for other property as well as for commercial real estate. The total
remaining lease payments under those leasing agreements amounted to A16.1 million as of December 31,
2018.

As of December 31, 2018, we also had contractual off-take obligations under recycled paper and
containerboard supply agreements, which amount to A46.3 million for the remainder of 2019. In addition,
as of December 31, 2018, our contractual obligations under energy supply agreements amounted to
A8.1million for the remainder of 2019. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2018, we had commitments under
open purchase orders amounting to A217.0 million.

**QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**

We are exposed to a number of different market risks arising from our normal business activities.

Based on our assets, liabilities and pending and planned transactions, we are particularly exposed to risks
arising from changes in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as credit risks, such as
the risk of default by counterparties. Furthermore, solvency must be assured at all times (liquidity risk).
The objective of risk management is to use appropriate measures to control these risks where they affect
our cash flows. Derivative financial instruments are used only for hedging purposes. They are not used for
trading or speculative purposes. Exchange effects resulting from the translation of financial statements in
foreign currencies into our reporting currency are not hedged. The guidelines for risk hedging and their
implementation are defined and continuously monitored by our Group Treasury Management department.

**Raw material price risks**

Raw material price risks result primarily from increases in the prices of recycled paper and containerboard,
which cannot fully be passed on to customers through higher sales prices or can only passed on to
customers with a time lag of two to three months.

111


-----

**Energy price risks**

Energy price risks result primarily from fluctuations in global energy prices and regulatory risks in
Germany and other markets in which we operate.

**Currency risk**

The foreign currency risk is due to the increasing internationalization of the Group and is an additional
risk that has increasing relevance as a result of the increased volatility in global interest rate and currency
markets relevance. We primarily generate our sales in euro. In our foreign subsidiaries where the euro is
not the local currency, there is a currency risk as these subsidiaries generate their sales mainly in local
currencies but their material costs are mainly measured in euro. Currency risk also arises on trade
receivables and payables in foreign currencies. Furthermore, there are currency risks due to the
euro-financing of foreign subsidiaries. Throughout the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and the first three
months of 2019, there were currency risks mainly in the British pound, Polish zloty and Czech koruna
relative to the euro.

**Interest rate risk**

Currently, interest rate risks arise mainly on interest-bearing liabilities that are denominated in euro.

We expect that our exposure to interest rate fluctuations will relate primarily to potential drawings under
our A50 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, our drawings under the GBP70 million Existing
Senior Secured GBP Facility as well as potential drawings under our A30 million Existing Senior Secured
HSBC Facility and our A30 million New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility. From time to time, we will
evaluate the necessity of future interest rate hedging.

**Credit risks**

Credit risks arise mainly on trade receivables, bank balances and derivative financial instruments. In view
of our relatively diversified customer list, which extends over various regions, the impact arising from credit
risk on trade receivables is limited. Further, the trade receivables of some of our subsidiaries are credit
insured up to the limit the credit insurer approves.

To minimize the credit risks from the operational business activity, transactions with customers are only
entered into after an internal credit check and a credit approval process. Based on the internal credit
check, a limit for a maximum credit risk per customer is established.

**SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, assumptions and estimates have been made which
affect the amounts and presentation of the assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial
position, income and expenses, and contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and
estimates could result in outcomes that may require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of our
assets and liabilities in future periods.

By ‘‘significant’’, we mean that the following accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results and require management’s subjective judgments, often as a result of the
need to estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We discuss the impact and risks
associated with these significant accounting policies on our business operations throughout this discussion
and analysis where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. You should note that
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during each reporting period.

All assumptions and estimates are made according to the best of management’s knowledge and belief in
order to present a true and fair view of our net assets, financial position and results of operations. Since the
actual values may, in individual cases, differ from the assumptions and estimates that were made, these are
continuously reviewed. Adjustments to the estimates that are relevant for the financial statements are
made in the period in which the change occurs, provided that the change relates only to this period. If the
change relates not only to the reporting period but also to subsequent periods, the change is taken into
account both in the period of the change and in the subsequent periods.

-----

**Tangible Fixed Assets**

Tangible fixed assets are measured at cost (including production costs and borrowing costs) less
depreciation. Production costs include material cost, manufacturing costs and exceptional manufacturing
costs, reasonable and necessary material and production overheads, general and administrative costs and
expenses for social services, voluntary social contributions and company pensions. Borrowing costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are included in the
cost of that asset. Depreciation is generally calculated on a straight-line basis. Straight-line depreciation
rates are increased by 50% for fixed assets which are used throughout the year in three-shift operations or
more.

**Investment Grants**

Investment grants (Investitionszusch¨usse) are separately recorded as special reserve on our balance sheet
under ‘‘Investment Grants for Fixed Assets’’ and reversed on a pro rata basis in accordance with useful life
of the fixed asset being subsidized. Investment bonuses (Investitionszulagen) have been recorded in our
income statement as other operating income at the time they are earned.

**Emission Allowances**

The German government has granted us a certain number of free emission allowances. These were
acquired free of charge as part of public allocation. We have recognized these emission allowances at their
nominal amount (zero) rather than at their fair market value, which German GAAP would have allowed us
to do. The fair value of the allowances recognized at a carrying amount of zero amounted to A3.5 million as
of December 31, 2016, A4.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and A15.5 million as of December 31, 2018.

**Valuation of Inventories**

Raw materials, consumables and supplies are measured at actual cost or, taking into account the principle
of lower of cost or market value, at lower market values as of the relevant reporting date. Appropriate
valuation allowances are applied to inventories which are obsolete, second-hand, damaged or slow moving
(A1.6 million in 2016, A1.8 million in 2017 and A8.7 million in 2018-).

Goods-in-progress and finished goods are measured at production cost. Production costs of
goods-in-progress comprises, in addition to direct manufacturing and material costs, appropriate portions
of overhead costs. Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to obsolete, second-hand, damaged or
slow-moving inventories.

**Receivables and Other Assets**

Receivables and other assets are recognized at their nominal value or at their lower fair value as of the
balance sheet date. Appropriate valuation allowances are provided for receivables whose recoverability is
associated with identifiable risks; irrecoverable receivables are written off in full. To cover the general
default and credit risk, a global valuation allowance of 1% is recognized on domestic and foreign
receivables (net of value added tax) which are not subject to a specific valuation allowance.

**Pension provisions**

Pension provisions for entitlements and current pension obligations are calculated using the Projected Unit
Credit (PUC) Method. They are calculated pursuant to section 253, paragraph 1, clause 2, section 253,
paragraph 2 and section 246, paragraph 2 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB).
Actuarial opinions have been furnished. Calculations are based on the ‘‘Guide tables 2018 G’’ of Dr. Klaus
Heubeck and an interest rate of 3.21% in 2018 (2017: 3.68%, 2016: 4.03%, in each case based on the
‘‘Guide tables 2005 G’’).

Anticipated salary increases are reflected at a rate of 2.0% for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Pension increases is
reflected at a rate of 2.0%, 2.0% and 0.0%, respectively, for 2016, 2017 and 2018. A fluctuation rate of
0.0% was used.

As of December 31, 2018, pension obligations for which provision were required to be recognized
amounted to A1.4 million. A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan asset. After
offsetting the fair value of the plan asset with the present value of the defined benefit obligation the

113


-----

unfunded defined benefit obligation has been disclosed as pension provision (A173 thousand in 2017 and
A280 thousand in 2018).

**Tax and Other Provisions**

Tax and other provisions are recognized for all identifiable risks and uncertain liabilities at settlement
amount. They are recorded at an amount in line with a reasonable business assessment. All risks arising up
to the balance sheet date and identifiable up to the date of preparation of the financial statements have
been taken into account. Provisions with a remaining term in excess of one year are discounted at the
average market interest rate for the last seven financial years as published by the German Central Bank
(Deutsche Bundesbank) corresponding to their remaining maturity.

In order to calculate deferred taxes due to the temporary differences between accounting for assets and
liabilities for commercial law purposes and for tax purposes or due to tax loss carry-forwards, the amounts
of the resulting tax charges or reductions are measured using the tax rates of the individual companies over
the time that the differences are phased out and not discounted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
offset against each other and are carried in the balance sheet at their nominal amounts.

Deferred tax assets on tax losses carried forward were recognized to the extent that the underlying tax
planning confirmed that the amounts recognized could be utilized to reduce tax liabilities in the next five
years.

**SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GERMAN GAAP AND IFRS**

Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum have been
prepared on the basis of German GAAP, which differ in certain respects from IFRS. The following
paragraphs summarize certain significant differences between German GAAP and IFRS as of
December 31, 2018.

The organizations that promulgate IFRS have ongoing projects that could have a significant impact on
future comparisons of German GAAP and IFRS. This description is not intended to provide a
comprehensive listing of all such differences specifically related to us or the industry in which we operate.
IFRS are generally more restrictive and more comprehensive than German GAAP regarding recognition
and measurement of transactions, account classification and presentation and disclosure requirements. We
have not attempted to identify all disclosure, presentation or classification differences that would affect the
manner in which transactions and events are presented in the consolidated financial statements or the
notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

We have not prepared audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Accordingly, we
cannot assure you that the differences described below would, in fact, be the accounting principles creating
the greatest material differences between our consolidated financial statements prepared under German
GAAP and under IFRS. In addition, we cannot estimate the net effect that applying IFRS would have on
our results of operations or our financial position, or any part of them, in any of the presentations of
financial information in this offering memorandum. The effect of such differences may be material and, in
particular, it may be that the total shareholders’ equity (capital deficit) and net income prepared on the
basis of IFRS would be materially different due to these differences.

**Financial Statement Presentation**

Under IFRS, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on a current/non-current distinction of assets
and liabilities. IFRS requires the presentation of assets and liabilities in order of liquidity only when a
liquidity presentation provides information that is reliable and is more relevant than a current/ non-current
presentation. Under German GAAP, the presentation of the balance sheet is based on the liquidity of the
assets and liabilities. This results, for example, in the different presentation of financial assets and
liabilities and deferred taxes in the statement of financial position under IFRS and German GAAP.

Unlike IFRS, German GAAP does not require the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income
and it is very common (but not required) that the income statement under the German GAAP will be
prepared using the ‘‘nature of expense’’ method and not the ‘‘cost of sales’’ method, which is generally used
in the IFRS financial statements. In addition, the disclosures required in the explanatory notes to the
financial statements are far more extensive under IFRS than under German GAAP.

**Consolidation Principles**

Under IFRS, capital consolidation has to follow the acquisition method, with identifiable assets and
liabilities being measured at their acquisition-date fair values.

Under German GAAP, capital consolidation was required to be reported using the carrying amount
method until 2009. From 2010, the acquisition method and valuation by acquisition date fair values was
introduced into German GAAP.

Under IFRS, an entity (investor) is required to consolidate another entity (investee), depending on
whether it controls the investee. An investor controls an investee when it has power over an investee, is
exposed, or has rights to the variable returns from its involvement and due to his power can influence the
amount of these variable returns. The consolidation conclusions under IFRS will not differ significantly
from the German GAAP regulations for the most straightforward entities. However, some differences may
arise where there are complex group structures or where specific entities have been established. Investors
that are most likely affected have their involvements, for example, in the following entities:

   - Entities with a dominant investor without a majority of the voting or similar rights and where the
rest of voting rights belongs to the widely-dispersed shareholders (de-facto control);

   - Structured entities (formerly ‘‘special purpose entities’’) where voting or similar rights are not the
dominant means to determine the power.

Under German GAAP, an investor is required to consolidate the investee if an investor holds the majority
of voting rights, enjoys the right to appoint or dismiss the majority of the management and supervisory
board members, enjoys the right to exercise a controlling influence on financial and operating policies or in
substance obtains the majority of risks and rewards of an investee that has a narrow, well-defined purpose
(‘‘special purpose entity’’).

**Business Combination**

Under IFRS 3 acquisition related cost (transaction cost) that incurs to effect a business combination are
accounted as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.

Acquisition-related costs are not part of the consideration transferred to the seller in return for the
business; they are not part of the fair value of the acquired business; they do not represent an asset of the
acquirer. Acquisition-related costs represent services that have been rendered to and consumed by the
acquirer. As such, IFRS 3 states that they are accounted for as an expense when the acquirer consumes the
related service.

Under German GAAP certain cost which have been incurred after the decision to acquire an entity qualify
for capitalization and form part of the acquisition cost (e.g. due diligence cost, consultancy cost for
valuation reports). All expenses incurred prior to the decision making have to be expensed as incurred.

Costs related to the issuance of financial liabilities are expensed as incurred. Optionally, interest-like
expenses are capitalized and amortized over the term of the debt.

For purchase price allocation all identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the subsidiaries
are reflected at their fair value regardless of the level of minority share. Under IFRS 3, goodwill acquired
in a business combination, must be allocated to a cash generating unit (CGU) or group(s) of CGUs. A
CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of
the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Under German GAAP goodwill is allocated to the
respective business unit to which it refers.

Under IFRS goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually and if there is an indication that
goodwill may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of the CGU is compared with its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is defined
as the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of
an asset or CGU is less than its carrying amount, an entity should reduce the carrying amount to the
recoverable amount. The reduction is an impairment loss. For assets carried on the depreciated historical
cost basis the impairment loss should be recognized in profit or loss immediately. For assets that are
carried at revalued amounts an impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. The loss is first set
against any revaluation surplus relating to the asset in other comprehensive income to the extent of the
surplus and the remaining balance of the loss (if any) is then treated as an expense in profit or loss.

115


-----

German GAAP requires goodwill to be amortized over its economic life. Goodwill should be reviewed for
impairment and its remaining useful life once a year. Goodwill is impaired if its carrying amount exceeds
its fair value.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Under IFRS, the recorded acquisition cost of property, plant and equipment includes appropriate
dismantling, removal and restoration costs. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset are capitalized as part of
the cost of that asset. Overhead costs, such as general and administrative costs and expenses for social
services, voluntary social benefits and company pensions are not part of the production cost. Under IFRS,
individual items within property, plant and equipment are frequently composed of different component
parts with varying useful lives or consumption patterns. These parts are individually replaced during the
useful life of an asset. Under IFRS, each such part of an item of property, plant and equipment with a cost
that is significant in relation to the total cost of the item is recognized and depreciated separately
(component approach). Costs of required and regular major inspections are capitalized and depreciated if
it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the reporting entity and
the cost of the item can be measured reliably. After initial recognition IFRS further offers an option to
value items of property, plant and equipment at either the (lower) cost of the item less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment or at its fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated
depreciation and impairment.

Under German GAAP, property, plant and equipment is initially valued at purchase or production cost and
includes general and administrative costs and expenses for social services, voluntary social benefits and
company pensions. Capitalization of costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or
production of a qualifying asset is permitted, but not required (alternative treatment). The component
approach is not specifically contemplated by German GAAP rules, but its use for balance sheet purposes is
generally permitted. Costs of regular major inspections are recognized in the income statement as
incurred. A revaluation model is not permitted. Costs of demolishing or restoring an item of property,
plant and equipment do not qualify for capitalization but are required to be reported as provision over the
item’s useful life. After initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are accounted for at cost less any
accumulated depreciation.

**Government Grants**

Under IFRS, government grants related to a particular asset are recorded on the balance sheet either as
deferred income or by deducting the grant in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset.

Under German GAAP, government grants related to a particular asset are recorded on the balance sheet
either as deferred income or by deducting the grant in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset.
Alternatively, a grant may be recorded as other income in the income statement on the grant date.

**Business Start-up and Expansion Expenses**

Under German GAAP, expenses for the start-up and expansion of a business, if incurred prior to the end
of 2009, were permitted to be capitalized and amortized over a period of four years in accordance with
section 269 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB). In the subsequent periods, a
similar to IFRS accounting approach for recognition of the business start-up and expansion expenses is
applied.

Under IFRS, expenses for start-up and expansion of a business do not qualify for capitalization and have
to be expensed in the income statement at the time of incurrence.

**Impairment of Assets**

Under IFRS, an impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying
amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less
cost of disposal and its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset unless
the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups
of assets.

Under German GAAP, an impairment loss for non-current assets must only be recorded if a permanent
impairment in value is anticipated. The concept of cash generating units is not applicable under German

116


-----

GAAP, and the impairment loss is determined on an item-by-item basis. An impairment loss is to be
recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.

**Provisions, Other Liabilities and Contingencies**

Some provisions in the financial statements under German GAAP will be required to be reported as other
liabilities in accordance with IFRS. Under IFRS, provisions are recognized if an enterprise has a present
obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable (i.e., more likely than not to occur) that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. In cases where the outflow of economic resources is expected to occur, an obligation will be
reported as a liability. The discount rate used to determine the amount of any provisions is determined by
reference to a pre-tax interest rate for a risk-free obligation that matches the maturity of the liability to
which the provision relates.

Under German GAAP, the criteria for the recognition of provisions and contingencies are less detailed and
prescriptive than under IFRS. Accordingly, there is greater flexibility under German GAAP to record
provisions for onerous contracts and restructuring expenses. In addition, German GAAP estimates are
typically made in a more conservative manner. The recognition of a provision with a probability lower than
50% is possible. German GAAP requires the recording of provisions for deferred maintenance that is
expected to be performed within three month after the end of the reporting period, uncertain liabilities
and expected losses from executory contracts. Long-term provisions (i.e., with a maturity of more than one
year) are discounted using an average market interest rate for the preceding seven years as published by
the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank).

Under IFRS, acquisition costs for property, plant and equipment include the initial estimated costs of
dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. The corresponding
restructuring provision is required to be made at its present value. Under German GAAP, restructuring
provisions are build up incrementally over the useful life of the acquired property, plant or equipment at a
discounted settlement amount.

**Valuation of Assets and Liabilities; Currency Translation**

Under IFRS, initial recognition and subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities—if
qualified as financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss—is required at its fair value.
Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are measured at fair value.

Under German GAAP, current financial assets are required to be recorded at acquisition cost and financial
liabilities are required to be recorded at repayment cost. Current receivables and liabilities in foreign
currency are measured at fair value. The valuation of non-current currency receivables and liabilities with a
maturity more than one year has to be in line with lower of cost or market principle and higher carrying
amount at the balance sheet date respectively.

**Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings; Prepaid Expenses**

Under IFRS, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of the
consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing
loans and borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Under German GAAP, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are recorded at their repayment amounts.
Transaction costs, except for costs to be paid to the finance providers, are expensed as incurred. Only
equivalent to interest transaction costs paid to finance providers are deferred as prepaid expenses and
amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense.

**Sales, Trade Receivables**

Under German GAAP in effect as of January 1, 2016, the definition of ‘‘sales’’ includes all revenue derived
from the regular business activities of the reporting entity.

Under IFRS, ‘‘revenue from certain ancillary business activities is recorded as ‘‘other operating income’’,
rather than ‘‘sales’’.

For IFRS, the standard (IFRS 15) sets a five-step-model for recognizing revenue from contracts with
customers 1. Identify the contract with customer, 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract,

117


-----

3. Determine the transaction price, 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations,
5. Recognise revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.

Under German GAAP, valuation allowances for losses on individual trade receivables must be recorded. In
addition, a general provision for doubtful accounts—reflecting the general default risk of receivables—has
to be recorded. Under IFRS, the recording of such a general provision for doubtful allowances would be
prohibited.

**Leasing**

Under IFRS until December 31, 2018, a lease had to be classified either as an operating lease or as a
finance lease. A finance lease was a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and benefits incident to
ownership of the leased item. For finance leases, the lessee recorded an asset and an obligation at an
amount equal to the lower of the fair value of leased property and the present value of the minimum lease
payments. Operating leases were expensed as incurred.

With implementation of IFRS 16, starting for periods after January 1, 2019, lessee has a right of use asset
and contrary a liability.

The right-of-use asset is a lessee’s right to use an asset over the life of a lease. The asset is calculated as the
initial amount of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made to the lessor before the lease
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred, minus any lease incentives received.

The amortization period for the right-of-use asset is from the lease commencement date to the earlier of
the end of the lease term or the end of the useful life of the asset. An exception is when it is reasonably
certain that the lessee will exercise an option to purchase the asset, in which case the amortization period is
through the end of the asset’s useful life.

If a right-of-use asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment is immediately recorded, thereby
reducing the carrying amount of the asset. Its subsequent measurement is calculated as the carrying
amount immediately after the impairment transaction, minus any subsequent accumulated amortization.

At the termination of a lease, the right-of-use asset and associated lease liability are removed from the
books of the lessee. The difference between the two amounts is accounted for as a profit or loss at that
time.

Under German GAAP, accounting for leases is mainly driven by tax regulations, so the lease contracts in
Germany typically consider such rules in order to avoid capitalization at the lessee level. These rules differ
from the IFRS rules in several respects.

**Provisions for Pensions**

Under IFRS, provisions for defined benefit pension obligations are accounted for under the projected unit
credit method. The defined benefit obligation is measured using various actuarial assumptions, including
assumptions as to future compensation and benefits levels. Under IFRS, the discount rate reflects the
long-term view of the plan and not current rates that could be used to settle the pension obligation. This
discount rate is derived at the reporting date based on then current capital market conditions. Under one
of the options provided by IFRS, remeasurement gains and losses that result from changes in actuarial
assumptions (including changes in mortality tables) or actual experience that differs from the underlying
assumptions do not require recognition of gains and losses as components of net pension cost of the period
in which they arise. Rather they are recognized in other comprehensive income, which will never be
reclassified in profit or loss in the future.

Pension reserves under German GAAP are also be accounted for under the projected unit credit method
since the enactment of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act in 2009. Under German GAAP,
the discount rate used represents a ten-year average of market derived interest rates (until 2015:
seven-year average market derived interest rate). In addition, German GAAP requires recognition of the
remeasurement gain or losses in profit and loss and not as other comprehensive income as required under
IFRS.

**Deferred Taxes**

Deferred tax assets (DTA) and deferred tax liabilities (DTL) are the income taxes recoverable or payable
in future years. They are mainly based on the taxable or deductible temporary differences between the

118


-----

carrying amount of an asset or liability and the respective tax base. Due to the IFRS accounting principles,
the carrying amount of an asset or liability can differ from the amount under German GAAP. Accordingly
the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities change as well.

Under German GAAP, net DTL must be recognized in full, while the recognition of net DTA is optional.
Unlike German GAAP, IFRS does not provide an option to capitalize net DTA and, therefore, both net
DTA and net DTL have to be recognized in the respective period.

Under IFRS, DTA shall also be recognized for tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable that
future taxable profit will be available. Under German GAAP, the capitalization of DTA for loss
carryforward shall only be taken into consideration if the tax benefit from the tax loss carryforward can be
expected to be recovered within the next five years.

**Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging**

Under IFRS, derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value
(marked-to-market). Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken
directly to the income statement, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognized
in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss for the period when the forecast
transaction being hedged occurs. Under IFRS, the criteria to be met to qualify for hedge accounting are
quite strict. This includes stringent documentation requirements.

Under German GAAP, there is more flexibility to include forecast transactions in hedge accounting.
Further, there is no need to separately account for fair values of derivative financial instruments that
qualify for hedge accounting (net hedge presentation method).

**INTRODUCTION**

Containerboard is one of the principal materials used to manufacture corrugated board and, ultimately,
corrugated containers. Containerboard is classified according to the type of raw materials from which it is
made (virgin fibres or recycled fibres), whether it is surface treated and whether it is enhanced by coating.

Two types of containerboard can be produced. Containerboard made from virgin fibres (wood pulp) is
known as ‘‘kraftliner’’ and is—depending on the type of application—better suited for manufacturing
corrugated board and containers intended for the retail and consumer packaging markets, owing to its
greater strength, especially its high bursting strength, moisture resistance and purity. Containerboard made
from recycled fibres (recycled paper, the primary source of which is old corrugated containers and mixed
recycled paper), is known as ‘‘testliner’’ and fluting and is better suited for transportation and industrial
packaging, due to its higher stiffness, lower weight and cheaper price.

Containerboard is classified as kraftliner as long as it contains mainly virgin fibres. Several distinct types of
containerboard products are available in the market, resulting from different formulations of virgin and
recycled fibres. This broad offering of containerboard products serves to address a wide range of potential
packaging applications.

Both kraftliner and testliner can be surface treated to improve printing quality through the use of white,
mottled or fully bleached pulp as the top layer (white-top liner). The board can also be coated, which
makes it more resistant to dirt and moisture, and allows high-gloss printing. This further enhances product
appearance and suitability for retail and consumer packaging.

Virtually all containerboard becomes corrugated board, in the form of linerboard and fluting. Linerboard
is used for the inner and outer layers of the corrugated board and fluting for the middle section.
Corrugated board producers select containerboard grades, specifications and suppliers based on
availability, suitability for their own corrugators and converting machines as well as on brand owners’
performance requirements. The retail industry, through its own specific requirements, has also been one of
the key drivers for containerboard and corrugated board technology and product development.

For corrugated box and sheet producers, containerboard is one uniform market as corrugated board can
consist of a mixture of any type of linerboard or fluting depending on end use and quality requirements.
Corrugated board can come in a range of types, including single face, single wall, double wall, or triple
wall, depending on the ultimate packaging application.

Corrugated board is eventually converted by corrugated box producers into regular slotted containers
(RSC), die-cut boxes or other containers, and sold to brand owners or packers before reaching retailers
and end-consumers. The main end-use segment in Europe is food and beverages, although the breakdown
varies by country. Kraftliner is used especially in the food segment, where strength and purity are
important requirements, whereas testliner is generally used in non-food fast-moving consumer goods and
consumer durables.

The industry is typically viewed as comprising two main production activities: (i) the production of
containerboard and corrugated board; and (ii) the conversion of corrugated board into corrugated

120


-----

containers or other fibre-based packaging products. There are several operating models within the
containerboard and corrugated board industry. The majority of containerboard suppliers are forward
integrated such that they also operate in corrugated board and box conversion. This can allow a greater
degree of control over raw material flows and pricing. Others keep a more restricted focus on particular
high-value sections of the production process, and distribute products to independent sheet plants.

We focus on the highly efficient production and processing of standardized grades and customized small
batch series of corrugated board sheets for our mostly family-owned customers in the packaging industry.
We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated paper and
packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that bring addedvalue to our customers in the packaging industry, _i.e., the efficient and integrated production of_
containerboard and corrugated board. Progroup, although we have the ability to produce kraftliner,
focuses on testliner production for the European market.

In Western Europe, recycled paper is the main raw material for the production of recycled containerboard
and other fibre packaging boards. Recycled containerboard constitutes approximately 83% of
containerboard production, with kraftliner constituting the remainder. In Europe, containerboard
manufacturers tend to source the majority of their raw materials from external suppliers.

**INDUSTRY FUNDAMENTALS AND DRIVERS**


The containerboard and corrugated board industry is relatively capital intensive and competitive.
Long-term demand for these products is driven by global economic trends, demographic trends,
technological developments and trends in end-user preferences. Profitability is sensitive to changes in
prices, and industry profit cycles reflect the constantly shifting balance between supply and demand for
individual products.

**Macro demand drivers and industry trends**


A number of factors underlie the growth of corrugated packaging, the end product of containerboard and
corrugated board. In general, the growth of the general economy, industrial production and merchandise
trade are the main demand drivers for containerboard and corrugated board packaging. Private
consumption as well as the increased use of substitutes (e.g. plastic) also drive the development of retail
sales.

The charts below show the evolution of Euro area industrial production and containerboard demand
growth in Western Europe, and the evolution of Euro area GDP and containerboard demand growth in
Emerging Europe, based on available data from RISI.

Historically, there has been a strong correlation between GDP growth, industrial production and demand
growth for recycled containerboard. In Western Europe, demand has grown faster than industrial
production since 2012 and reached its peak in late 2017/early 2018, with a deceleration in the later part of
the year and an expected decrease in growth rates between 2019 and 2020. In Eastern Europe, growth rates
have been consistently, and significantly above GDP growth since 2000 and the demand growth is expected
to continue in the medium term, despite uncertainties in the shorter term, with demand decelerating in
2018 mainly due to Turkey and slower growth in Central Europe.

Demographic and lifestyle changes, including rising urbanization and demand for convenience, such as
take-aways and home deliveries, have driven growth in demand for corrugated packaging, and will
continue to do so especially in Emerging Europe (defined as Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe by
RISI). The effect of improvements in living standards and consumer spending in Emerging Europe and
other emerging markets will support growth going forward. Development of the retail infrastructure in
these markets, including online shopping and mail order, and the development of the logistics market, is
expected to increase demand for containerboard products such as die-cut containers, shelf-ready packaging
and decorative corrugated pieces. In addition, the booming agro-based sector, for example, will create new
demand for containerboards by replacing the traditional wooden boxes with corrugated containers.

Containerboard demand will also be increasingly exposed to the general tendency to reduce packaging
costs, with, for example, light weighting and reduced packaging. Plastics and returnable/reusable transit
packs (RTP) will increasingly compete with corrugated board packaging, especially in mature markets and
especially for the fresh fruit and vegetable markets. The future competitiveness of fibre-based packaging
will depend on innovation, product development, cost and the industry’s ability in general to respond to
changing market requirements.

The competitive position of containerboard and corrugated board is expected to remain relatively strong in
comparison with alternative materials. Recyclability, for example, will have a favorable impact on
containerboard demand growth. The high recovery and recycling rate of wood fibre-based packaging
compared to plastics will benefit the industry. The poor environmental image of plastics coupled with its
higher cost are also expected to have a positive impact on the demand prospects for fibre-based packaging
in mature markets.

Some of the newer products, such as microflutes, will support the use of containerboards and corrugated
boards in the competition against folding cartons. Retail- and shelf-ready packaging has opened new
opportunities for corrugated board and has brought it closer to the consumers. Logistic and shelf space
planning are key competitive advantages against other packaging substrates.

Recycled containerboard capacity has steadily gained share of the Western European containerboard
market over the last 15 years. The share of these grades rose from approximately 77% during the last years
of the 1990s to approximately 83% in 2018. The growing importance of recycled containerboard has been
driven by a variety of reasons, including i) lower prices of both PfR and recycled containerboard versus
virgin grades (partly due to subsidies for energy uses); ii) improving quality of testliner products and
kraftliner substitutes; iii) efforts by consumer goods companies to burnish their sustainability and
consumer demand for recycled products leading to a surge in kraftliner substitutes; iv) market undersupply
of unbleached kraft pulp.

Like Western Europe, the containerboard market in Emerging Europe is dominated by recycled grades.
Usage of recycled containerboard has increased substantially as a share of the total over the last 15 years
within Emerging Europe. Recycled products represented 60% of regional containerboard consumption in
the last years of the 1990s, but the share reached almost 80% in 2018. Expanding availability of
high-quality recycled grades, partially from Western European suppliers, and a greater focus on
sustainability were major drivers of the rising share of recycled products.

Containerboard is generally a regional business, and the majority of the volumes is traded within Europe.
However, some regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa, are net importers of containerboard.
Hence, the demand from exports of the containerboard market is partially influenced by the evolution of
the EUR/USD exchange rate.

**END-MARKETS DYNAMICS**

Demand for corrugated containers is primarily driven by the need for (i) packaging products for the
transportation of a diverse range of consumer and industrial goods, such as processed and fresh food,
agricultural products, beverages, industrial and consumer electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and a

122

range of other products and (ii) higher value-added corrugated products, such as those featuring enhanced
graphics used for point-of-sale displays and consumer and shelf-ready packaging.

In Europe, the main markets are the developed Western European countries such as Germany, Italy,
France, Spain and the United Kingdom. Poland and other Eastern European countries are much smaller
markets, but are anticipated to grow at a faster rate than the more developed markets.

In Europe, fast moving consumer goods account for approximately 55% of corrugated board consumption
(according to Vision Hunters), offering certain stability against economic fluctuations. However, there are
clear differences between countries. Industrial products are the primary driver in Germany while food and
consumer goods dominate in the United Kingdom and France. Germany is expected to remain the largest
single market in the Western Europe corrugated box industry over the next 15 years. The continuing
strength of the German industrial sector is predicted to boost corrugated box usage by 2.6% annually
through 2026 according to Vision Hunters, which is the second highest forecasted growth rate of any
country in Western Europe after Austria.

**Key supply parameters**

Containerboard is manufactured either by treating virgin fibres or by cleaning and screening recycled fibres
before passing these through paper machines, which are comprised of a paper-forming section, a press
section (where water is squeezed out), a drying section and the finishing. The containerboard is then
wound into rolls and shipped to corrugated board plants.

Containerboard mills are large, capital expenditure intensive production facilities and the production
landscape is continuously changing as a result of new capacity additions and closures. As there is a
significant lead time between the planning and completion of new containerboard machines, the supply
side tends to lag behind changes in demand.

Furthermore, the containerboard production process is reasonably specialized, such that there is very
limited flexibility to switch from containerboard production to the production of other paperboard grades,
or from kraftliner to testliner (or vice versa), in response to market conditions.

Corrugated sheets are interim products manufactured from containerboard at a sheet feeder plant or an
integrated corrugated and converting plant. Corrugated sheets are then converted into corrugated
containers at integrated converting plants or at sheet plants. The corrugated sheet is first printed, if
required, and then formed into the final container (or box) shape usually by some combination of
die-cutting, folding, gluing, stapling or stitching the sheet. Corrugated containers are designed specifically
to meet individual customer requirements and there is a wide variety of designs available.

Corrugated sheets are bulky products, which tend to be produced and supplied locally due to high
transportation costs, requirements of customers for supply chain integration and just-in-time delivery. The
economic supply distance for corrugated sheets is typically around 300 kilometers. Therefore, there are
many corrugated board plants and the market in Europe is more fragmented than the containerboard
market.

123


-----

Since the early 2000s, there has been a significant development in the European containerboard industry
and its asset base: more than 15 new machines have started up, all of which are capable of producing the
full range of recycled fibre grades. This is part of a constant push towards increasing efficiency and
lowering manufacturing costs in order to ensure competitiveness. These manufacturing costs are exposed
to raw material prices and availability (recycled paper vs. virgin pulp). The response from the suppliers has
been to use cheaper raw materials both in containerboard and corrugated packaging production.

There have been shut-downs in Europe, but these have typically been of old and narrow machines with
weak cost competitiveness and suboptimal trim fit and/or product portfolio. Shut-downs have typically
been part of companies’ asset strategy, and their volumes have typically been compensated by capacity
increases in other production units. The production landscape is described in greater detail below.

The European containerboard and corrugated board industry has experienced several trends affecting
product and product construction as well as production process. Some of the trends originate from the
end-users (retail, consumers and brand-owners), but the industry itself has also managed to introduce new
concepts. All these trends have raised the status of corrugated board from pure transportation packaging
closer to retail and even consumer packaging. The key trends can be listed as follows:

  - Light weighting, which has extended to both containerboard and corrugated board. This is a
response to transportation cost pressure, as well as industry evolution and a trend towards
eco-efficiency;

   - Small flutes and multiwall constructions are partly related to the light weighting as the introduction
of lower basis weight fluting has enabled the microflute concept and use of corrugated in consumer
packages as well as increasing need in heavy duty applications;

   - Die-cuts and point-of-sales (POS), which is to satisfy the demand for retail ready packaging;

  - White-top liners and high-quality printing are for direct use consumer packages and shelf ready
packaging; printing requirements are increasing in industrial packaging; and

  - Wider corrugators have been introduced to improve the efficiency at corrugated plants and better
fit with new containerboard machines.

**Pricing dynamics**

Containerboard prices are primarily a function of the prevailing supply-demand balance (in this respect,
additional growth has resulted from the strong increase in e-commerce volumes), raw material prices and
other operating costs, such as energy, chemicals and transportation.

Demand for containerboard has tended to develop in line with industrial growth rates due to the
characteristics of the main end-user markets for corrugated containers. In contrast, the supply side of the
containerboard market is fairly inelastic owing to capital intensity, long lead times between planning and
completion of a mill and the low versatility of the paper machines. This can result in temporary supply/
demand imbalances driving prices up and down, such as those which have been experienced in recent
years.

Another driver of containerboard prices is the cost of the principal raw materials: recycled paper or virgin
fibre. While wood prices historically have been relatively stable, recycled paper prices can vary widely on a
regional basis depending on demand and tend to be volatile even within short time periods. Fluctuations in
Asian demand (particularly Chinese demand) and seasonal patterns of collection and demand have been
the principal factors driving the recycled paper price in recent years. Given the significant implications of
price fluctuations of recycled paper on business performance, we (as well as several other industry
participants) have therefore sought better access to recycled paper through a broad supplier portfolio
including access to box plant clippings and direct supply contracts with municipalities or retailers from time
to time. The cost of producing containerboard is also influenced by the prices of energy, starch, chemicals
and transportation. Energy prices, in particular electricity, oil and natural gas, have experienced significant
volatility in recent years, with a corresponding effect on paper production costs.

Containerboard is the main cost factor of corrugated sheets and of corrugated packaging overall.
Therefore, corrugated sheets price usually follows containerboard price development with some delay,
typically by about two to three months.

**KEY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS**

The corrugated box market in Western Europe has largely recovered from the economic crisis that
impacted the region after 2008: the 2007 pre-crisis demand peak for corrugated box was crossed in 2014.
Total box shipments amounted to 40.6 billion m2 in 2018, 0.8 billion m2 more than in 2017. RISI is
expecting growth to continue albeit at a slower pace in the future, with 1.7% and 1.3% growth forecasted
for 2019 and 2020, respectively. Over the long run, European shipments are expected to grow by 2.6%
annually between 2016 and 2026 according to Vision Hunters’ early 2018 study (with Western Europe,
Central Eastern Europe, and Southeastern Europe growing by 2.3% p.a., 4.1% p.a. and 3.8% p.a.,
respectively).

On the back of this market environment, leading producers of containerboard and corrugated board have
announced and implemented several price hikes throughout 2017 and the beginning of 2018. The total
price increase in recycled containerboard in 2017 amounted to 100 to 110 A/ton. In the beginning of 2018,
only part of the announced 50 to 60 A/ton price increase in recycled containerboard was implemented in
Continental Europe. Driven by a slow-down in demand during the latter part of 2018, prices reduced
across most of Continental Europe markets during both the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, with a
120 A/ton decrease between Q4 2018 and May 2019. Prices are expected to stabilise in the second half of
2019.

**Demand development in Europe**

_Western Europe_

Containerboard usage in Western Europe had been experiencing solid growth. There was an uptick in
demand in 2017 due to accelerating industrial production and increased consumer spending followed by
strong growth in the first half of 2018, with the regional apparent consumption reaching 24.6 million tons
in 2018, a 2.3% yearly growth in Western Europe. Following a deceleration in demand growth over the
second half of 2018, RISI predicts growth in containerboard demand to continue upwards in the following
two years, albeit at a slower rate.

_Emerging Europe_

Growth in containerboard usage in Emerging Europe has continued over the past several years. However,
the rate of increase has fallen to less than half of that registered over the last 17 years as a whole, from
7.3% per year (2000-2017) to 2.9% per year in 2018. Regional containerboard consumption reached
12.0 million tons in 2018 versus only 3.8 million tons in 2000.

Within Emerging Europe, our core market is the Central European region, which has been the major
driving force for Emerging Europe demand in recent years. Apparent containerboard consumption growth
in the region was 4.5%, 7.4% and 2.5%, for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and the region is expected to
continue to grow at an average 4% between 2019 and 2023, per RISI.

Corrugated board consumption has grown faster by sheet area than by volume during the past years due to
the trend towards lighter basis weights. This trend is expected to continue in the future with corrugated
board based on light-weight containerboard showing higher growth rates than the overall market, and
future market growth expected to approximate the levels between 2002 and 2007.

**Containerboard supply developments and operating rates evolution in Europe**

_Western Europe_

Net capacity expansion in the Western European containerboard industry came to a halt between 2007 and
2013 after expanding rapidly during the 1990s and first half of the last decade. In the past year there has
been moderate growth. New capacity has continued to come on stream, mainly in lightweight recycled and
white-top grades, but older, inefficient capacity has been shut. Regional capacity hit 24.4 million tons in
2007 and was still 24.6 million tons in 2013, according to RISI; since then it has grown to 27.1 million tons
(2017). RISI expects capacity growth of 3.5%, 2.1% and 3.1% in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

Operating rates peaked in 2006 at 95% in Western Europe before dropping sharply to a bottom of 87% in
2009. Strong capacity management on the part of producers kept operating rates from sliding further, with
RISI’s numbers showing a 2% reduction in industry capacity in 2009. The continuing focus on capacity
management has been instrumental in enabling operating rates to rebound back to the long-term average
of 93% in 2010-2017. RISI shows that capacity utilization raised to above 96% in 2017 and reduced slightly
to 95% in 2018.

Capacity expansion is expected to continue growing over the next several years, although at a lower rate
than previously expected due to a lessening in demand and weaker macro conditions. The majority of the
projects announced during the year are converted graphic paper machines, along with incremental
upgrades of existing containerboard capacity although less than initially announced. Additional new
capacity has been announced, e.g. Progroup’s PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna (Germany) and Papierfabrik
Palm’s machine in Aalen (Germany), both adding further 750kt capacity each by 2020 and 2022
respectively.

RISI expects containerboard operating rates to decline to 93% in Western Europe in 2019 (from 96% in
2017) with anticipated oversupply in Central Europe and Italy creating downward pressure on
containerboard and PfR prices. Operating rates are expected to stabilize to approximately 92% in the
long-term, similar to the historical long-term average.

_Eastern Europe_

Containerboard capacity has expanded steadily in Emerging Europe since 2000, averaging growth of
424,000 tons per year. Most of the investment in the earlier part of this period involved rebuilds of existing
machines to both increase capacity and improve quality. Over the past few years, new, state-of-the-art

machines have been added, mainly in Central Europe and Turkey. Closures of existing, inefficient capacity
offset a substantial portion of the capacity originating from the new machines. Regional containerboard
capacity reached more than 12.7 million tons in 2018, up from just 5.1 million tons in 2000. The majority of
the total expansion has been in the recycled sector.

Operating rates in Emerging Europe improved consistently from 2000 to 2007, rising from 82% to 89%.
The abrupt flattening in domestic demand in 2008-2009, along with a loss of share to imports from Western
Europe and continuing investment in new capacity, resulted in regional capacity utilization decreasing to
79% in 2009. However, operating rates rebounded over the next four years, returning to 84% in 2013, and
increasing to 90% in 2018. This rate is expected to be at around 89% in the next five years.

Capacity is expected to continue expanding over the next several years in Emerging Europe, although
growth in certain sub-regions like Central Europe is expected to be limited due to raw material availability,
even if more than 3 million tonnes in capacity growth are expected in the long-term.

**Containerboard price development in Europe**

Testliner prices have trended upward during the last 15 years, although extreme volatility has tended to
mask this trend. Real prices (in 2016 euros) averaged A382/ton in the latter part of the 1990s and have been
around A479/ton over 2013 - 2017 and peaked to A552/ton in 2018. The range in real prices during the last
20 years has been from a peak of A552/ton in 2018 to a low of A321/ton in 2009. Both the trend and the
range in real prices have been closely related to movements in recycled paper costs, which have been
erratic on an annual basis and rising in real terms on a secular basis.

Strong demand for recycled containerboard and relatively low recycled paper costs allowed producers to
generate significant profit margins through much of the 1990s. RISI’s analysis shows the Western
European testliner industry registering a price to total cost ratio of around 0.96 in 1995-2000. Rapidly
increasing recycled paper costs and slowing demand growth resulted in profitability declining during the
last decade, reaching a low of 0.91 in the recession year of 2009.

Containerboard prices remained stable until the second quarter of 2008, when prices started to decline as
the rapid weakening of the global economy decreased the demand for corrugated boxes (and
containerboard). This was reflected in decreased demand and prices for testliner. Containerboard demand
started to increase in the end of 2009 and the upturn of the economy was seen in Europe by mid-year 2010.
Growth resumed in the international trade from early 2010 and the external demand and prices for
containerboard increased as well. The industry price to total cost ratio reached a peak of approximately
1.36 in 2018 and is expected to be closer to 1.1 for 2022 and 2023.

European testliner prices declined by approximately 20% from August 2011 to February 2012 due to the
soft supply/demand balance and due to decreased recycled paper prices. Improved demand as well as the
increase of recycled paper prices turned testliner prices back to growth track in mid-February 2012;
however, with the continuing economic slowdown, the price level was not sustainable and prices declined
as a result. In 2016, prices have further decreased by 4.0% in the last year in real terms, before surging by
6.8% in real terms in 2017 and by 8.1% in 2018. All containerboard prices follow each other and recycled

paper prices correlate well with them. Price difference between recycled paper and testliner has been on
average just above A300. During the recessional years 2008-2010, prices dropped due to weak demand and
the prices for testliner also dropped due to decline in raw material prices. After a steady increase in prices
between 2013 and 2015, testliner prices have been coming down since the start of 2016 despite of healthy
demand and no large capacity additions during 2016.

Whilst European recycled containerboard producers raised prices by approximately A100-110/ton in 2017,
they achieved only part of the announced A50-60/ton in early 2018, due to lower production costs and new
ramped-up capacity.

Prices have reduced by 120 A/ton between Q4 2018 and May 2019 due to a slow-down in demand, with
stabilisation is expected to begin in the second half of 2019 due to an improvement in demand.

**Corrugated board market developments**

European corrugated board shipments totaled 49.6 billion square meters in 2016, of which 12.9 billion
square meters were delivered in sheets, per Vision Hunters; the market has grown by 1.5% p.a. over
2000-2016. Vision Hunters estimates that the sheet market share has been slowly growing along with
increased converting capacity and has 26% share of total corrugated shipments as of 2016, up from 22% in
2000. Growth above industry average has resulted in an additional increase of the corrugated sheets
market by 2bn square meters since 2000.

**MARKET AND COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**

Containerboard products are largely standardized and, therefore, are subject to substantial price
competition. Price is also an important driver of competition in the corrugated market. However, the
corrugated market features a greater degree of differentiation than containerboard, with the purchasing
decision for customers also being based on a range of other factors, including delivery lead time, quality of
service, quality of product, consistency, quality of design and innovation in the packaging itself.

Existing European containerboard producers benefit from certain barriers to entry, including:

   - the difficulty, especially in Western Europe, of finding appropriate locations (including proximity to
reliable sources of virgin fibre in the case of kraftliner production and recycled paper in the case of
recycled containerboard) to build new mills and obtaining approvals from local governments; and

129


-----

   - substantial capital costs associated with building a new plant of the scale and quality necessary to be
cost-competitive with the production platforms of existing producers.

The corrugated board industry is more fragmented than containerboard and is comprised of a large
number of small, often family-owned and locally operating companies. Smurfit Kappa and DS Smith are,
in terms of scale, significantly larger than any other competitors in the market.

According to Vision Hunters, Progroup Board is the number three producer and largest independent
corrugated board producer in Europe by volume produced and Progroup Paper is the number six producer
of recycled containerboard in Europe by capacity.

Many of our competitors are fully integrated and focus on serving larger end-customers in large batch
sizes, including global consumer corporates. Our differentiated business model allows us to serve a higher
number of customers, process a higher number of orders and maintain higher production volumes (up to
370 million square meters per annum), thereby generating economies of scale. We are solely focused on
the production process as opposed to many of our competitors, who also focus on more complex and
customer-specific packaging requirements for a smaller number of larger customers and, hence, only have
a production output of typically 70-80 million square meters per annum. Our operational model allows for
significantly higher productivity levels compared with industry average, per Vision Hunters.

Over the past 27 years since our foundation, we have achieved leading market positions in the countries in
which we operate. We are among the top three corrugated board producers in Europe (by production
capacity) and our market share in our specific segment, the corrugated sheet market in Europe, is
approximately 15%, according to Vision Hunters. In our core market segment, namely corrugated board
sheets, we are the market leader by volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic and
the Netherlands and hold considerably higher market shares compared to our position in the overall
European containerboard and corrugated board market, according to Vision Hunters. In containerboard
production, we have a market share of approximately 4% by production capacity, according to Vision
Hunters.

Unlike many of our competitors, who grew historically over many decades or had to integrate production
infrastructures inorganically through acquisitions, we differentiate ourselves with a well-invested asset base
and high-quality, complementary, modern and strictly aligned, high capacity production facilities placed
purposefully in strategic locations. Our strategy has enabled us to experience above market growth rates
resulting from organic growth alone. The CHP Acquisition allowed us to further expand our asset base
with a tailor-made power plant that was specifically designed to meet the steam requirements of our paper
machine PM2.

**BUSINESS**

**OUR COMPANY**

We are a leading, family-owned producer and supplier of containerboard and corrugated board in Central
Europe and are headquartered in Landau, Germany. According to Vision Hunters, we are the third largest
producer of corrugated board in Europe (by production capacity) through our corrugated board business
(‘‘Board’’) and the sixth largest producer of recycled containerboard in Europe (by production capacity)
through our containerboard business (‘‘Paper’’). We focus on the highly efficient production and
processing of standardized grades and customized small batch series of corrugated board sheets for our
mostly family-owned box manufacturing customers. In this core market segment, we are the market leader
by volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, according to
Vision Hunters. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other market participants (i.e., fully integrated
paper and packaging producers) through our strategic focus on those elements of the value chain that
bring added-value to our customers in the packaging industry, _i.e. the automated and integrated_
production of containerboard and corrugated board. Our customers serve various end markets, including
industrial/manufacturing, consumer durables, processed foods, non-food manufactured consumer goods
and fresh food. Unlike many fully integrated market players, we do not produce boxes and therefore do
not compete with our box manufacturing customers but instead focus solely on the production of
containerboard and corrugated board.

Through our large scale and highly flexible production, built up primarily via a greenfield approach, we are
able to realize significant economies of scale. Since we commenced operations in 1992, we have carefully
selected the locations of our production sites and have grown organically by pursuing primarily a greenfield
strategy to create an optimal geographic set-up of our production sites across the markets in which we
operate. As a result, we benefit from a well-invested asset base and production sites with high
technological standards, resulting in a relatively low cost base compared to many of our competitors and
relatively low requirements for additional capital expenditures in the short- to medium-term. Given the
high technological standards of our production facilities, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from
major growth trends in our industry, such as (i) increasing demand for light-weight packaging, (ii) the
increasing importance of small-size packaging due to the growing importance of e-commerce, and (iii) the
general trend towards a more efficient and sustainable use of raw materials and energy, which can help
reduce costs, CO2 emissions and fresh water consumption.

Our core business comprises Paper and Board. The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible
containerboard production using almost exclusively recycled paper, with high output volumes to increase
cost efficiency and short delivery times. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and the first three months of 2019,
containerboard produced by Paper accounted for most of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our
corrugated board production within Board. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration and the
ability of Board to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly
flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. In addition, our customers benefit from our
integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking
options.

Paper manufactures containerboard at our two paper mills in Germany, with an envisaged total annual
production capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons of containerboard. Our two existing paper machines,
PM1 in Burg and PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, have complementary production layouts which allow us to
produce brown containerboard with grammages between 60-230g/m[2] using almost exclusively recycled
paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard with the
appropriate widths for Board’s ten existing corrugated board production sites in the Czech Republic,
France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a total annual production capacity of
approximately 1,440,000 tons of corrugated board, including our latest corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’
(PW12) at Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom. Our historic greenfield location strategy ensures close
customer proximity and high production flexibility. Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we
further acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH, the combined heat and power plant (the ‘‘CHP’’) adjacent to
our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and certain related assets (the ‘‘CHP Acquisition’’). As a result thereof,
we started producing a significant portion of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine
PM2 ourselves (‘‘Power’’).

In 2018, we sold approximately 1,151,000 tons of corrugated board and approximately 176,000 tons of
containerboard to external customers across Europe, resulting in external corrugated board and
containerboard sales, respectively, of A840.0 million (86.9% of total sales) and A84.5 million (8.7% of total
sales). Paper’s total sales in 2018 include A17.9 million (1.9% of total sales) in revenues from the sale of
electricity and revenues from the incineration of refuse-derived fuel resulting from the integration of the
CHP as well as A9.7 million (1.0% of total sales) in sales from passing purchased fuel costs to Sales and
Solutions GmbH. Total external sales by Board and Paper in 2018 (including sales other than corrugated
board or containerboard sales, respectively) amounted to A840.8 million (87.0% of total sales) and
A112.9 million (11.7% of total sales). Our total sales and EBITDA in 2018 amounted to A966.1 million and
A275.5 million, respectively. Sales in Germany (origin), our core market, accounted for 55.8% of total sales
and 42.0% of sales by volume in 2018.

Primarily to support our core business, Paper and Board, we have established our own logistics operations,
including a fleet of currently 59 trucks (‘‘Logistics’’). Most of the remaining A12.4 million in sales (1.3% of
total sales) in 2018 were generated by Logistics.

Founded in 1991, we are indirectly majority-owned by J¨urgen Heindl, our founder and chief executive
officer.

**OUR STRENGTHS**

We believe we benefit from the following competitive strengths.

**Differentiated business model with leading market positions in attractive market environment**

Our founder, J¨urgen Heindl, designed a business model differentiating us from our competitors. Through
our strategic value chain positioning in containerboard and corrugated board production only, we do not
compete with our targeted customers, who are primarily family-owned, small and medium-sized
businesses. Our core customers focus on packaging solutions for the end-customer and typically do not
have their own corrugated board production capability. Many of our competitors are fully integrated and

133


-----

focus on serving larger end-customers in large batch sizes, including global consumer corporates. Our
differentiated business model allows us to serve a higher number of customers, process a higher number of
orders and maintain higher production volumes per production site (up to 370 million square meters of
corrugated board per annum), thereby generating economies of scale. We are solely focused on the
production process as opposed to many of our competitors, who also focus on more complex and
customer-specific packaging requirements for a smaller number of larger customers and, hence, only have
an average production output of typically 70-80 million square meters per production site per annum.

In 27 years since our foundation, we have achieved leading market positions in the countries in which we
operate. We are among the top three corrugated board producers in Europe (by production capacity) and
our market share in our specific segment, the corrugated sheet market in Europe, was approximately 15%
according to a March 2018 market study by Vision Hunters. In our core market segment, namely
corrugated board sheets, we were the market leader by volumes sold in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the
Czech Republic and the Netherlands, according to Vision Hunters, and we hold considerably higher
market shares in those markets compared to our position in the overall European containerboard and
corrugated board market. Following the fast and successful ramp-up of our corrugated board production
site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we have also become a very significant player in the Polish market, and
we have further become a significant player in the UK market, as a result of the commencement of
production in January 2019 and ongoing ramp-up at our newest corrugated board production site (PW12)
in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, which replaced the much smaller and now decommissioned
production site PW8. In addition, the commencement of production at our corrugated board production
site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, with an annual corrugated board production capacity
of approximately 100,000 tons, marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe.
In containerboard production, we had a market share of approximately 4% by production capacity in
Europe, according to the March 2018 market study by Vision Hunters.

While we believe our differentiated business model, high reliability and quality of product supply,
significant scale, internal sourcing and geographic coverage provide us with a competitive advantage in our
core market segment, we also benefit from attractive market fundamentals of the overall industry.

The paper and packaging industry is experiencing overall growing demand from industrial economies in
Central Europe, and we believe that Germany and Central Europe, our key markets, generally provide a
positive economic outlook. From a product perspective, the increasing significance of light-weight paper
and packaging solutions as well as small-size packaging and the increasingly online and mail order-driven
retail sector is expected to further stimulate packaging growth. We believe our modern production
facilities, particularly PM2, which is capable of producing light-weight paper grades economically on a
commercial scale, position us well to benefit from these growth trends in the industry. Furthermore,
production is driven by the strong increase in demand from emerging economies, where production and
packaging standards are adapting to the standards of developed countries, from which we also benefit with
our production in Poland and the Czech Republic

**Uniquely designed, best-in-class and strategically located, low-cost production asset base built up via**
**greenfield strategy**

Since our foundation in 1991, we have carefully designed and selected our production operations and
locations via a dedicated greenfield strategy to establish highly efficient, flexible and technologically
advanced production facilities, which were ahead of the existing market standard at the time. We believe
we are the fastest organically growing corrugated board producer in Europe and have developed a unique
track record and expertise in successfully establishing new greenfield corrugated board production sites.
This includes a dedicated and experienced in-house projects team tasked with identifying attractive market
opportunities for profitable growth, completing the planning and construction phases of the relevant
projects on time and on budget and managing fast and successful ramp-ups of production at the relevant
sites.

Designing our production set-up primarily via a greenfield strategy allowed us to invest in the best
available production specifications and optimize the alignment and compatibility of our paper machines,
PM1 and PM2, with our corrugators. The current 2.5m, 2.8m and 3.3m trim widths of our various existing
corrugated board plants can be very efficiently combined with the 5.8m trim width of PM1 (2 � 2.8m or
2.5m + 3.3m), the 10.2m trim width of PM2 (4 � 2.5m or 3 � 3.3m) and the 9.2m trim width of our
proposed new paper machine PM3 (2 � 3.3m + 2.5m or 2 � 2.8m + 3.3m), resulting in low volumes of
cutting scrap and higher productivity.

Our corrugated board production sites have been purposefully located approximately 500 kilometers from
each other. This footprint ensures close customer proximity with full regional coverage of our customers
and limited overlap to limit the transportation distance in most circumstances to 250-300 kilometers. Our
strategic footprint also allows us to achieve high production flexibility and reliable just-in-time delivery
with short lead times. Furthermore, we are able to serve our customers from different locations, thereby
optimizing transportation costs and capacity utilizations on a plant-by-plant basis, which is coordinated
centrally from our headquarters in Landau following a ‘‘one mill approach’’. We believe our location layout
and organization give us a competitive advantage in terms of cost efficiency and customer orientation. On
average, we serve approximately 50-80 customers per corrugated board production site and each of our
production sites offers the entire range of customer services (e.g., 24 hour delivery and online ordering and
tracking).

We believe that all of our plants are equipped with state-of-the-art technology, which is the foundation of
our low-cost and efficient production. According to Vision Hunters, the asset quality of our paper
machines is characterized as high and above comparable European containerboard and corrugated board
producers. Performance metrics of PM1, such as capacity and technical age, are well above the industry
average. PM2, which we believe to be among the world’s most advanced paper machines for recycled
super-light-weight paper and which specializes in the production of super-light-weight to medium-weight
containerboard with grammages of 60-130g/m[2], ranks best in class for all metrics and has set five new world
records since its launch in 2010.

Unlike many of our competitors, who grew historically over many decades or had to integrate production
infrastructures inorganically through acquisitions, we differentiate ourselves through our well-invested
asset base and high-quality, complementary, modern and strictly aligned, high capacity production facilities
placed purposefully in strategic locations.

**Strong, diversified and long-standing customer base**

We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, some of which date back to the start of
our operations in 1992. We have grown with our large German customers as they have expanded across
Europe and have successfully entered into new relationships with key customers outside of Germany. We
currently supply 350 to 400 different Board customers, with a strategic focus on family-owned, small and
medium-sized companies. Our top five Board customers accounted for approximately 7%, 4%, 3%, 3%
and 2%, respectively, of our total corrugated board sales, by tons, in 2018, while our top five external Paper
customers accounted for approximately 28%, 12%, 11%, 8% and 5%, respectively, of our total external
containerboard sales, by tons, in 2018.

We believe that our ability to provide reliable delivery of high-quality, cost-effective and tailor-made
products and being a family-owned business have enabled us to foster strong partnerships of mutual
dependence with our mostly family-owned customers, operating as a fundamental part of their supply
chains by improving inventory management, security of supply and customer service.

Our strong customer relationships are reinforced through a combination of our geographic reach, our
manufacturing and logistics excellence, and the limited availability of alternative suppliers with the capacity
and geographic proximity to provide a competitive offering. At some of our corrugated board production
sites, certain long-standing customers have established their own box manufacturing plants in immediate
proximity to our site, either on our own land or on land adjacent to our site (so-called ‘‘Packaging Park I
**Model’’). As a variation of this original packaging park model, we commenced production in October 2015**
at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which we established in immediate
proximity to an existing packaging plant of our customer, Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk, on land owned
by our customer. As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced production in the
first quarter of 2017 at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we
purchased from our large customer Janmar Centrum adjacent to its existing packaging plant. We refer to
these variations were we establish our own corrugated board production sites close to our customers as the
‘‘Packaging Park II Model’’. Following the success of these two packaging park projects (PW9 and PW10),
we also established our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy as a packaging park
project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of our new customer, Italian packaging
specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l.

135


-----

30MAY201908580748

All versions of the packaging park model help us to further strengthen our relationships with key
customers (or win significant new customers, as in the case of Imbal Carton S.r.l.) and benefit both us and
the relevant customers. The high level of integration between our own corrugated board production and
the box production of our customers also made possible through the packaging park model creates a
number of efficiencies and largely eliminates freight and other logistics costs between Board and our
packaging park customers. Our packaging park customers also typically purchase a very high percentage
(up to 100%) of their corrugated board requirements for the relevant box plant from us, which means
predictable, high volume orders and consistently high utilization levels for the relevant corrugated board
production sites. Index pricing arrangements with our packaging park customers ensure a predictable
pricing mechanism for all parties. It typically takes approximately two to three months for containerboard
mills to pass on their raw material price increases to their customers, _i.e. manufacturers of corrugated_
board. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to recover
containerboard cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for corrugated board
manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases on to their customers.

**Technology and innovation leader**

There are general industry trends towards lighter and more functional packaging and towards a more
efficient use of resources. The trend towards ‘‘light paper’’ (i.e., containerboard) has been particularly
strong in Germany and has been further strengthened by the increasingly online and mail order-driven
retail sector, which is expected to further stimulate demand growth for light packaging solutions. We
believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in
Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany, which specializes in the production of super-light-weight to medium-weight
containerboard with grammages of 60-130g/m[2]. As demand for super-light-weight containerboard (with a
grammage below 90g/m[2]) is increasing, we believe that PM2 gives us a significant advantage over many of
our competitors, both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Our proposed further paper machine
PM3, on the other hand, is designed to provide standard containerboard grades with grammages of
90-130g/m[2]. Once this newest paper machine will commence operation, we believe it will give us the ability
to put an even stronger focus on the production of super-light-weight containerboard (i.e. 70 - 80g) at PM2
and to focus production at PM1 on specialty containerboard such as kraftliner substitutes and
containerboard with a higher grammages above 130g/m[2]. We believe the expected further specialization of
our paper machines will further enhance the productivity of all our paper machines as each paper mill will
be able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. For more detail on our proposed new paper machine
(PM3), see also ‘‘—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated
_board producer in Europe through controlled investments’’ below._

In addition, we continuously work to improve our product designs, optimize the utilization of our assets
and explore new ways to further reduce our input costs and secure the long-term sustainability of our core
businesses, both from an economic and environmental perspective. In particular, we are focused on further
reducing the use of fibre (i.e., recycled paper) in our products as well as the amount of energy required for
our production processes and the shipment of our products, in order to both maintain a competitive cost
position in our industry and to reduce emissions and waste.

136

We believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001, our paper machine PM1 was the world’s technologically
most advanced containerboard paper machine setting new technology standards, including with the use of
a closed water cycle, thereby minimizing the creation of waste water. Launched in 2010, we believe that
PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machines, which we believe has allowed us to set new
industry standards with respect to raw material efficiency. As described in more detail under ‘‘—Our
_Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe_
_through controlled investments’’ below, we further decided to make certain significant additional_
investments in connection with the proposed establishment of our newest paper machine (PM3), which we
expect will result in significant cost savings in the mid- to long-term as well as significant reductions of CO2
emissions, waste water and natural gas consumption. These investments include a state-of-the-art waste
overall waste-heat concept as well as a ‘‘first-of-its-kind’’ closed cycle waste water treatment system.

We have invested significantly in the development of a ‘‘green’’ range of ‘‘next generation’’ products
working in close cooperation with BHS Corrugated GmbH, one of our equipment suppliers, and a team of
researchers at the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f¨ur angewandte Wissenschaften) in
Regensburg, Germany. We market these products under our own brands next fibre�, next board� and next
box�. All of these product innovations involve the use of super-light-weight containerboard produced by
our paper machine PM2 as well as innovative flute designs of our corrugated board formats, intended to
further reduce raw material input and thereby further reduce weight, input costs and CO2 emissions.

**Significant synergies through high degree of vertical integration**

In 2018, containerboard produced by Paper accounted for approximately 75% of the containerboard, by
volume, used by our corrugated board production within Board. As a result of the steady expansion of our
corrugated board production capacity in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have
increased from approximately 62% (or 67%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of total
containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2016 to approximately 82% (or 93%, if we include
containerboard sales to swap partners) of total containerboard sales, by volume, of Paper in 2018. With the
fast and successful ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica,
Poland during 2017 and early 2018, we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals
and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of
integration between Paper and Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board
production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the
new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further
improved utilization of our other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further
increase in the corrugated board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of
containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our
corrugated board production within Board will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper.
As we have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in
Eisfeld, Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter
of 2020) and plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe
between 2020 and 2023 (including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to
commence production in late 2020 or early 2021), we expect to successively increase this net short position
with regard to containerboard even further at least in the short-term. We therefore currently do not expect
the volume of our external containerboard sales to significantly increase again unless and until we
complete our proposed further paper machine project (PM3) in the second half of 2020. For more details
on our expansion projects and investment program, see also ‘‘—Our Strategy—Maintain and strengthen our
_position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled investments’’ below._
With an envisaged total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons, Paper produced
approximately 1,020,000 tons and 1,035,000 tons of containerboard in 2018 and 2016, respectively. In 2018,
approximately 811,000 tons were sold internally to Board (2016: 738,000 tons of internal containerboard
sales), and a further approximately 111,500 tons were sold pursuant to swap agreements with other
containerboard producers (2016: 106,000 tons of sales to swap partners), which allow us to reduce
transportation costs, optimize our production program and swap internally produced containerboard for
certain containerboard grades we do not produce in sufficient quantities, such as kraftliner. The remaining
approximately 64,000 tons of containerboard we sold in 2018 were sold externally (2016: approximately
198,000 tons of external containerboard sales, excluding sales to swap partners). With a total annual
corrugated board production capacity of approximately 1,440,000 tons (including (i) 100,000 tons of
capacity of our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, which commenced
production in early March 2018 and (ii) more than 200,000 tons of capacity of our newest corrugated board

‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, which commenced production in January 2019)
as of the date of this offering memorandum (2016: total annual corrugated board production capacity of
approximately 1,130,000 tons), Board produced approximately 1,151,000 tons of containerboard in 2018,
compared to approximately 930,000 tons of corrugated board in 2016. We believe that a high degree of
vertical integration and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality
containerboard in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business.
At the same time, we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or
improve our overall Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared
to corrugated board margins) of certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our
integrated approach through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking
options. The steady increase in the degree of vertical integration between Paper and Board over the last
few years has also been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply chain. See also
‘‘—Our Strategy—Achieving further cost-savings and efficiency improvements through further increased external
_containerboard purchases’’ below._

**Strong track record of profitable growth**

Since 2015, we successfully completed a number of recent expansion and other investment projects,
including the CHP Acquisition as well as the successful establishment of four new corrugated board
production sites (PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12), with the construction of our new corrugated board
production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany progressing on schedule and earthworks for our third paper
machine (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany having started in January 2019. In addition, we
successfully implemented a series of initiatives in recent years as part of our Continuous Improvement
Program to improve the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities, optimize (i.e., minimize) our
variable costs and stabilize our specific fixed costs in order to achieve sales excellence and maintain our
position as one of the cost leaders in our industry.

As a result of these and other factors, we have managed to continue to significantly improve our
profitability and cash position and moved the Group to a structurally enhanced level of profitability in
recent years. In particular, we have managed to increase our EBITDA from A81.7 million in 2013 to
A125.1 million in 2014, A152.9 million in 2015, A154.7 million in 2016, A180.4 million in 2017 and
A275.5 million in 2018. During the same period, our EBITDA margin (calculated by dividing EBITDA by
sales) improved from 14.0% in 2013 to an exceptional 28.5% in 2018. Combined with our controlled
investment strategy, which should normally allow us to adapt the amount of our expansion capital
expenditures in line with our projected mid-term cash requirement, we believe we are in a strong financial
condition to weather and/or adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole.

**Committed family shareholders and experienced management team for long-term stability**

Our company was founded in 1991 by J¨urgen Heindl, our chief executive officer, and continues to be
controlled by him and his two sons, Maximilian Heindl and Vinzenz Heindl. We believe this family link and
the strong personal and long-standing financial commitment of our owners ensures our focus on stability,
long-term value generation and prudent investment strategies. J¨urgen Heindl’s expertise is supported by a
strong and growing management team with extensive industry experience, including within our Group. Our
management team has impressively demonstrated its abilities by creating one of Europe’s leading
containerboard and corrugated board players in 27 years while withstanding economic downturns and
restructurings. In response to the increasing size and complexity of the Group and to free up management
capacity to allow J¨urgen Heindl to focus on the strategic development of the Group, we have successfully
professionalized and expanded our senior management team, including our Executive Board. Dr. Volker
Metz rejoined the Group as our chief financial officer in November 2016, after previously having served as
our head of controlling between 2009 and January 2016. Similarly, after spending seven years with one of
our largest international competitors, Philipp Kosloh rejoined the Group in November 2016 and was
appointed a deputy member of our Executive Board, with a view to becoming our first chief operating
officer. Mr. Kosloh had previously served in various capacities within the Group between 2001 and 2009.
Effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Kosloh became a regular member of the Executive Board and assumed the
role of chief operating officer. In addition, after gaining several years of relevant work and management
experience in the paper industry outside the Group, Maximilian Heindl joined the Group in August 2016
as the manager in charge of production and technology at Paper (PM1 and PM2) and with overall
responsibility for Power. From August 1, 2017, Maximilian Heindl took over further responsibility within
the Group as a deputy member of the Executive Board and, effective January 1, 2019, he became a regular

138


-----

member of the Executive Board and assumed the role of chief development officer. Maximilian Heindl’s
work and management experience outside the Group, his management roles at Paper and Power, his
appointment to the Executive Board and gradual assumption of further responsibilities are all part of a
deliberate, long-term succession plan for our founder and chief executive officer J¨urgen Heindl with the
goal of securing our future as a successful family-owned business into the next generation.

**OUR STRATEGY**

**Maintain and strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through**
**controlled investments**

To maintain and further strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in
Europe in the long-term and to allow us to successfully meet ongoing and expected future market growth
and the requirements of our customers with regard to supply certainty and product quality, we intend to
continue to make prudent and controlled investments to further expand and improve the efficiency of our
production facilities as part of our long-term ‘‘Two Twentyfive’’ strategy, as long as (i) we are confident we
can achieve payback periods for our investments that are aligned with the maturity profile and relevant
headroom under our financing arrangements, (ii) we maintain sufficient financial flexibility to weather
and/or adapt to challenges that may face us or our industry as a whole, and (iii) any such investments
would be consistent with our long-term target leverage. In addition to further capacity expansion, our ‘‘Two
Twentyfive’’ strategy, among other things, also contemplates a gradual technological transition and
generation change away from the use of corrugators with a trim width of 2.5m, which are installed and
currently in use at some of our older corrugated board production sites, to the use of more modern
corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our corrugated board production sites.

Following the successful completion of the ramp-up of production at our corrugated board production site
(PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, which commenced production in October 2015, we had already
accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals in 2016 and were already operating within our target
corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and Board. However, in the short-term to
mid-term, we still intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our
corrugated board production capacity to be able to seize what we believe are numerous further market
opportunities for profitable growth, similar to those that led to the successful establishment of our most
recent production sites (PW9, PW10, PW11 and PW12) in Pl¨ossberg (Germany), Trzcinica (Poland),
Drizzona (Italy) and Ellesmere Port (United Kingdom). In continuation of our organic growth strategy, we
intend to primarily achieve further growth by pursuing further expansion opportunities via greenfield
projects.

In addition to the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica,
Poland during 2017 and early 2018 following commencement of commercial production in April 2017, we
commenced production at our corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, in early March
2018 and at our newest corrugated production site (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, in January
2019. As with our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany and our corrugated
board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland, we established our production site (PW11) in Drizzona,
Italy, as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of a customer,
Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l., which allows us to supply this new customer largely without
freight and other logistics costs. The commencement of production at our corrugated board production
site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately
100,000 tons, also marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe. With a total
investment of approximately A85-A90 million into the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega
plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom to replace our now decommissioned corrugated board
production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers from the new site, we have now also become a
significant player in the UK market. This newest corrugated board production site operates with a 3.35m
trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than
double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), which we established in
2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width. We believe that the new production site, with its large
capacity and state-of-the-art equipment, is one of the largest and most efficient corrugated sheet board
plants globally and positions us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we have
historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins.

While we have historically pursued a pure greenfield growth strategy, including the three packaging park
projects (PW9, PW10 and PW11), our newest corrugated board production site (PW12) in the United

139


-----

Kingdom as well as the proposed new corrugated board production sites (PW13 and PW14), we are also
evaluating and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire attractive assets from competitors which
would complement our existing network of production sites, advance our goal of further increasing our
corrugated board production capacity and meet the other internal investment and financing criteria
described above. In addition, in order to maintain and/or strengthen our relationships with certain large
and long-standing customers or in response to opportunities to establish relationships with significant new
customers, we will consider additional packaging park projects whereby we would establish corrugated
board production sites at or in proximity to the packaging plants of the relevant customers.

With the fast and successful ramp-up at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland,
we had already accomplished one of our long-standing strategic goals and had already been operating at
the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard to the level of integration between Paper and
Board. We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in
Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board
‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our
other corrugated board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated
board production of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019, i.e. we expect
that the recycled containerboard sourcing requirements of our corrugated board production within Board
will significantly exceed the internal supply capacities of Paper. In the short-term to mid-term, we
nevertheless intend to continue to focus our investment activities on further expanding our corrugated
board production capacity. We have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board
production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany, with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter of
2019 or the first quarter of 2020. We expect to make total net investments (net of subsidies) of
approximately A60 million at this site, which is slightly higher than our earlier estimates of approximately
A50 million. This cost increase primarily relates to additional investments which will increase the annual
corrugated board production capacity of the new site to approximately 175,000 tons, from the originally
proposed capacity of approximately 140,000 tons. Higher than originally expected civil engineering costs
(due to the booming construction sector) also contributed to the expected overall cost increase. In
addition, we plan to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites in Central Europe
between 2020 and 2023, including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14), which we expect will
operate with a 3.35m trim width and have an annual corrugated board production capacity of up to 215,000
tons. We expect to invest approximately A70-75 million into this new plant, which will have capabilities
similar to our ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom and, we envisage, will commence
production in late 2020 or early 2021. Primarily to fund our expected investments into this new site, we
entered into the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and
the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, with total commitments of A75 million. For more details about
these New Senior Secured Facilities, see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior
_Secured Erste Bank Facility’’, ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured LBBW_
_Facilities’’ and ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’. As a_
result of these proposed additional corrugated board production sites, we expect our annual corrugated
board production capacity to increase from approximately 3.0 billion square meters (including our
corrugated board production sites (PW11 and PW12) in Drizzona, Italy and Ellesmere Port, United
Kingdom) to approximately 4.2 billion square meters.

**Preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a cost-efficient and**
**highly flexible manner through our new paper machine project**

In order to preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a
cost-efficient and highly flexible manner in sufficient quantities to meet the majority of the sourcing
requirements of the expanding corrugated board production within Board, we have also begun to actively
pursue the realization of a further paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.
Earthworks for the new paper machine already started in January 2019 and, subject (among other things)
to obtaining the missing regulatory approvals and construction proceeding according to plan, we currently
expect this further state-of-the-art paper machine to start production in the second half of 2020, with a
total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 750,000 tons. Following completion of the ramp-up
phase of this potential further paper mill, this would mean an increase of the total annual containerboard
capacity of Paper from currently approximately 1,100,000 tons to approximately 1,850,000 tons. The new
paper machine (PM3) will have a 9.2m trim width, which would allow us to optimize containerboard
production to meet the requirements of the more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at
most of our newer corrugated board production sites, which would result in low volumes of cutting scrap

140


-----

and higher productivity. Once PM3 has commenced operations, we also plan for further specialization of
our then three paper machines which we expect will further enhance the productivity of all our paper
machines as each paper mill will be able to focus on clearly defined paper categories. See also ‘‘—Our
_Strengths—Technology and innovation leader’’ above. We currently expect total net investment costs (i.e. net_
of expected subsidies) of approximately A465 million for this new paper machine project over a several year
period, including approximately A116.7 million of initial expenditures (e.g. for advanced payments for the
paper machine and certain preliminary work) we had already incurred as of the end of the first quarter of
2019. We expect to fund any such investments with a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from
our operating activities and additional borrowings, including drawings under the Existing Senior Secured
Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB
Facility and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility. The currently expected total net investment costs
of approximately A465 million in connection with the proposed establishment of our newest paper mill
(PM3) significantly exceed our earlier estimates of A375-400 million, primarily due to certain additional
strategic and value accretive investments we decided to make, which we expect to have significant
economical as well as ecological benefits once the new paper mill will be operational. A large portion of
the increase in the expected total net investment costs relates to investments into more energy-efficient
components as part of our overall waste-heat concept from the new paper mill. The installation of these
components is not legally mandated, but we expect it will result in significant cost savings in the mid- to
long-term as well as a reduction of CO2 emissions of up to 151,000 tons per year. In addition, we decided to
install a closed cycle waste water treatment system. Once our new paper mill is operating at the full
intended capacity of 750,000 tons of containerboard, we expect that this closed cycle waste water treatment
system will help us to avoid approximately 3,775,000 m[3] of waste water per year, cut the fresh water
consumption of the new paper mill by 3,750,000 m[3] and reduce CO2 emissions by approximately a further
19,900 tons per year. At full capacity, the system is expected to produce approximately 65,000,000 kWh per
year of bio gas as part of the waste water treatment process. The paper mill will use this bio gas in
connection with its production process, cutting its natural gas consumption by approximately 7-8%. We
further believe that the proposed closed cycle waste water system will minimize our reliance on third party
waste water treatment facilities (which have led to capacity constraints at our existing paper machine
(PM2) in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany in the past) and result in significant related cost savings in the future.
We further decided to install (i) a steam turbine which will allow us to produce a portion of the electricity
requirements of the new paper mill in an environmentally friendly manner and (ii) a direct rail connection,
which will give us the option to ship a portion of our future production in an environmentally friendly
manner by rail and, we believe, result in savings of freight cost and other operational benefits. An increase
in the expected costs of the necessary civil engineering works, due to the booming construction sector, also
contributed to the overall increase in the expected total net investment costs.

**Achieving further cost-savings and efficiency improvements through further increased external**
**containerboard purchases**

We expect that the start of production at our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona,
Italy in early March 2018, the significantly increased capacity of the new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’
(PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom as well as further improved utilization of our other corrugated
board production sites alone will lead to a significant further increase in the corrugated board production
of Board, so that we will remain a net purchaser of containerboard in 2019. As already described in more
detail above, apart from a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany which we
have already commenced construction, we currently expect to establish up to three further corrugated
board production sites between 2020 and 2023 (including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14)
which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early 2021). See also ‘‘—Maintain and
_strengthen our position as a leading, low-cost corrugated board producer in Europe through controlled_
_investments’’ above. Unless and until we complete the proposed new paper machine project (PM3), this_
expected increase in our corrugated board production may cause us to further increase the level of internal
containerboard sales to Board (and thereby the level of integration between Paper and Board) in 2019 and
to increasingly rely on purchasing containerboard from third party suppliers. We believe that targeted
external containerboard purchases that meet the specific sourcing requirements of Board will give us
additional flexibility and provide us with opportunities to further optimize (i.e., minimize) our variable
costs, for example, by allowing us to purchase containerboard that matches the specific grade and optimal
trim-width required for our corrugated board production from time to time, from external suppliers
located in close proximity to the relevant Board plants. We hope this will allow us to further reduce cutting

141


-----

scrap, further optimize logistics expenses and give us additional flexibility to optimize the utilization of our
existing paper machines (PM1 and PM2).

**Maintain cost leadership through continuous efficiency and profitability improvements**

In order to maintain profitability throughout the economic cycle, we have implemented a comprehensive
profitability improvement program (the ‘‘Continuous Improvement Program’’) to ensure the long-term
success of our Group. Our Continuous Improvement Program focuses on (i) improving the effectiveness of
our sales and marketing activities, (ii) optimizing (i.e., minimizing) our variable costs and (iii) stabilizing
our specific fixed costs in order to achieve sales excellence and maintain our position as one of the cost
leaders in our industry. Since 2012, our main focus in connection with our goal of achieving sales
excellence has been on (i) growing our external sales in excess of the general growth in market volumes
(and thereby increasing our market share), (ii) maximizing the impact of the introduction of our ‘‘next
generation’’ products into the market and (iii) optimizing our sales portfolio. As part of our efforts to
optimize our variable costs, we have focused on (i) reducing our consumption of raw materials,
(ii) optimizing our energy consumption and energy costs, especially at our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt
(PM2), and (iii) reducing the purchase prices of our key production factors, such as recycled paper, starch
and freight services. Overall, we have met or exceeded our targeted benefits through our Continuous
Improvement Program. We intend to continue to implement our Continuous Improvement Program and
identify and realize further improvement opportunities. See also ‘‘—Achieving further cost-savings and
_efficiency improvements through further increased external containerboard purchases’’ above._

**HISTORY**

Our Group was founded in 1991, when J¨urgen Heindl, our controlling shareholder and chief executive
officer, established PROWELL Papierverarbeitung GmbH and launched our first plant (PW1) for the
production of corrugated board in Offenbach a. d. Queich, Germany, in the following year. From the
beginning, we intended to focus on the highly-efficient production of small batch sizes of sheet board for
small and medium-sized customers based on high technological standards. In 1996, a second corrugated
board production site (PW2) was established in Douvrin, France, and, in 1998, a third corrugated board
production site (PW3) was launched in Burg, Germany.

Another key milestone in the development of our Group was the establishment of our first paper mill in
Burg with our paper machine PM1 for the production of medium- to heavy-weight containerboard with
grammages of 100-230g/m[2]. At the time, PM1 introduced a number of new technological features,
including a ‘‘2 gap former’’, a ‘‘drum pulper’’, a ‘‘speed sizer’’ and a closed water loop that minimizes the
creation of waste water. PM1 represented a significant intermediate step towards the high-speed
production of lighter containerboard.

In 2002 and 2005, respectively, we further expanded our corrugated board capacity by launching our fourth
and fifth corrugated board production sites in Rokycany, Czech Republic (PW4) and in Sch¨uttorf,
Germany (PW5). The corrugators at those two production sites have a width of 3.3 meters, which
represented a new technology standard for the industry at the time and resulted in significant productivity
gains. In 2007, we established Europe’s largest corrugated board production site in Offenbach a. d. Queich,
Germany (PW6), replacing the original PW1 facility at the same site. In 2009, we realized another two
greenfield projects with the construction of our corrugated board production sites in Strykow, Poland
(PW7) and Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom (PW8).

Also in 2009, we commenced construction of our second paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany, with
our paper machine PM2 commencing production of super-light-weight to medium-weight containerboard
in March 2010. To secure a portion of the necessary funding for our A420 million investment in our paper
machine PM2, we raised additional equity in 2008 and 2009. In particular, J¨urgen Heindl established
JH-Holding, our controlling shareholder, in 2007. JH-Holding entered into the Former JH-Holding
Facility and used a portion of the proceeds from its borrowings under the Former JH-Holding Facility to
subscribe for additional shares in the Issuer. In addition, the Issuer issued preference shares to
BWK GmbH Unternehmensbeteiligungsgesellschaft.

To secure a reliable supply of energy to our paper machine PM2, we entered into certain framework and
ancillary agreements with Progroup Power 1 GmbH and its parent company Sales & Solutions GmbH
(formerly EnBW Energy Solutions GmbH) in 2008 for the construction and operation of the CHP adjacent
to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt. The CHP commenced operation in 2011.

142


-----

In July 2014, we announced a strategic investment in the construction of our corrugated board production
site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany adjacent to and connected with a packaging plant of our customer
Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk. This site commenced production in October 2015. At our corrugated
board productions sites in Burg, Offenbach, Sch¨uttorf and Ellesmere Port, some of our customers have
established their own production sites in close proximity to, or even on, our production sites. With our
corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany, we followed our customer for the first
time and set up our facility at the existing site of a customer.

In April 2015, we refinanced all then outstanding amounts under our Former Senior Credit Facility with
the proceeds from the issuance of A250,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our Existing Fixed Rate
Notes and A150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Issuer’s senior secured floating rate notes due
2022, and we also entered into the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. At the same time, JH-Holding
Finance SA, a newly incorporated finance subsidiary of JH-Holding, the Issuer’s direct controlling
shareholder, also issued the PIK Toggle Notes, primarily to fund the acquisition of all rights under the
Former JH-Holding Facility and to fund the acquisition of all preference shares in the Issuer then held by
BWK GmbH Unternehmensbeteiligungsgesellschaft.

Effective as of midnight on December 31, 2015, we acquired Progroup Power 1 GmbH, the CHP and
certain related assets outright from EnBW. As a result thereof, we started producing a significant portion
of the energy required for the operation of our paper machine PM2 ourselves. The completion of the CHP
Acquisition constituted a significant milestone in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and allowed us
to significantly reduce our energy costs.

As a further variation of the packaging park model, we commenced production in the first quarter of 2017
at our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we purchased from our large
customer Janmar Centrum adjacent to its existing packaging plant.

Following the success of the two packaging park projects (PW9 and PW10) in Pl¨ossberg, Germany and in
Trzcinica, Poland, we also established our new corrugated board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy
as a packaging park project in immediate proximity to the existing packaging plant of our new customer,
Italian packaging specialist Imbal Carton S.r.l. The commencement of production at this new corrugated
board production site (PW11) in Drizzona, Italy in early March 2018, with an annual corrugated board
production capacity of approximately 100,000 tons, also marked our entry into the largest corrugated sheet
board market in Europe. In addition, with a total investment of approximately A85-A90 million into the
establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom to
replace our now decommissioned corrugated board production site (PW8) located just a few kilometers
from the new site, after its commencement of production in January 2019, we have now also become a
significant player in the UK market. This newest corrugated board production site operates with a 3.35m
trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity of more than 200,000 tons, more than
double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the old site (PW8), which we established in
2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width. We believe that the new production site, with its large
capacity and state-of-the-art equipment, is one of the largest and most efficient corrugated sheet board
plants globally and position us well to further grow in the United Kingdom, a market in which we have
historically been able to achieve above average EBITDA margins. As we have already commenced
construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld, Germany (with test
production expected to start in the fourth quarter in 2019 or the first quarter of 2020), we further expect to
establish up to three further corrugated board production sites between 2020 and 2023 including a further
corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence production in late 2020 or early
2021).

In 2018, we achieved a milestone in our corporate history by implementing our new branding in order to
further strengthen our core brand ‘‘Progroup’’, provide clearer focus and realize the full potential of the
‘‘Progroup’’ brand in the market. The previous individual brands ‘‘Prowell’’, ‘‘Propapier’’ and ‘‘Prologistik’’
were unified under a single umbrella at the end of November 2018. Since then, we have operated under a
single uniform and strong Progroup brand:

  - Progroup refers to the centralized management and administration of the Group by Progroup AG,
the Issuer, from our headquarters in Landau, Germany.

  - Progroup Paper (formerly Propapier) encompasses our containerboard production activities at our
two mills in Burg (PM1) and Eisenh¨uttenstadt (PM2) (both located in Germany) and also includes
the related energy production of Power at the CHP adjacent to our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt.

143


-----

  - Progroup Board (formerly Prowell) encompasses our corrugated board production at our ten
production sites in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom.

   - Progroup Logistics (formerly Prologistik) encompasses our own logistics operations, including a fleet
of trucks we operate primarily to service the business operations of Paper and Board.

To support this rebranding, we also changed the legal entity names of the various entities within our group
in the fourth quarter of 2018, except for Progroup AG and Prowell Verwaltungs GmbH.

The following is a brief description of our core business units, Paper and Board.

**PAPER**

Paper encompasses our containerboard production at our two paper mills in Burg and Eisenh¨uttenstadt,
with a total annual production capacity of approximately 1,100,000 tons of containerboard. Our two paper
machines, PM1 in Burg and PM2 in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, are complementary to each other due to different
production layouts and allow us to produce brown containerboard with grammages between 60-230g/m[2]

using almost exclusively recycled paper. This, in turn, allows us to internally source consistently
high-quality containerboard with the appropriate widths for our corrugated board production sites. To
cover the increasing demand for consistently high-quality containerboard, Progroup has begun the
realisation of a further paper machine project in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. The new, state-of-the-art
paper machine PM3 will start production in the second half of 2020 and provide a further production
capacity of around 750,000 tons of containerboard.

The focus of Paper’s operations is highly flexible containerboard production, with high output volumes to
increase cost efficiency and short delivery times. During 2018, containerboard produced by Paper
accounted for approximately 80-85%, by volume, of the containerboard sourcing requirements of our
corrugated board production within Board. As a result of the steady expansion of our corrugated board
production capacity in recent years, internal containerboard sales to Board have increased to
approximately 82% (or 93%, if we include containerboard sales to swap partners) of the total sales, by
volume, of Paper in 2018, which means that we had already accomplished one of our long-standing
strategic goals and had already been operating at the top end of our long-term target corridor with regard
to the level of integration between Paper and Board. We believe that a high degree of vertical integration
and making full use of the ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard in a
cost-efficient and highly flexible manner creates significant synergies for our business. At the same time,
we believe that the high share of internal containerboard sales may help us stabilize or improve our overall
Group margins by reducing our exposure to lower or more volatile margins (compared to corrugated board
margins) of certain external containerboard sales. Our customers benefit from our integrated approach
through short lead times, just-in-time delivery and online ordering and tracking options. The steady
increase in the degree of vertical integration between Paper and Board over the last few years has also
been allowing us to further optimize our internal logistics and supply chain. In 2018, our Paper operations
generated A112.9 million in external sales, which represented 11.7% of our total sales. The majority of
these external containerboard sales were generated under one-year contracts with packaging customers.
The remainder of our external containerboard sales in 2018 was generated through spot market and
multi-year supply agreements. Our external containerboard customers include both other producers of
corrugated board as well as commodity traders. In 2018, our five largest Paper customers accounted for
approximately 63% and our ten largest Paper customers for approximately 76% of our external
containerboard sales by volume.

**Paper Machine PM1**

Launched in 2001, our paper machine PM1 marked the start of the Group’s vertical integration into the
production of containerboard. With a trim width of 5.8 meters, it produces medium- to heavy-weight
containerboard with grammages of 100-230g/m[2] using recycled fibre and, to a small extent, virgin fibre. We
believe that, at the time of its launch in 2001, PM1 was the world’s technologically most advanced
containerboard paper machine setting new technology standards, including with the use of a closed water
cycle, thereby minimizing the creation of waste water. Through a series of investments and optimization
measures since its launch, we have been able to significantly improve the annual capacity of PM1 from
approximately 287,000 tons of containerboard in 2001 to approximately 420,000 tons in 2018. In addition,
since the launch of our paper machine PM2, we further developed PM1 towards the production of heavier
paper grades (i.e., grammages of 100-230g/m[2]), including testliner, kraftliner, proliner K, fluting paper and
promedium S.

**Paper Machine PM2**

Launched in 2010, our paper machine, PM2, is calibrated to produce super-light-weight to medium-weight
containerboard, including testliner and fluting paper, with grammages of 60-130g/m[2] using almost
exclusively recycled fibre. We believe that PM2 is among the world’s most advanced paper machine based
on trim width and designed speed. This allows us to set new industry standards with respect to raw material
efficiency, cost leadership as well as containerboard and corrugated board design. With its ability to
produce super-light-weight paper grades, PM2 helps us to reduce consumption of recycled paper. For
more information about our range of ‘‘next generation’’ products, including next fibre� and next board�,
see ‘‘—Sustainability Focus; Research and Development’’ below. With a trim width of 10.2 meters, PM2 has
an annual containerboard capacity of approximately 680,000 tons, and since its launch in 2010, PM2 has set
five new world records for production speed of various lightweight paper grades. We believe that PM2
enables us to generate significant savings in fibre input, which is essential to our ability to improve our
competitive position and future profitability.

**Paper Machine PM3**

Furthermore, in order to preserve our ability to internally source consistently high-quality containerboard
in a cost-efficient and highly flexible manner in sufficient quantities to meet the majority of the sourcing
requirements of the expanding corrugated board production within Board, we have also begun to actively
pursue the realization of a further paper machine project (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.
Earthworks for the new paper machine already started in January 2019 and, subject (among other things)
to obtaining the missing regulatory approvals and construction proceeding according to plan, we currently
expect this further state-of-the-art paper machine to start production in the second half of 2020, with a
total annual containerboard capacity of approximately 750,000 tons. Once PM3 has commenced
operations, we also plan for further specialization of our then three paper machines which we expect will
further enhance the productivity of all our paper machines as each paper mill will be able to focus on
clearly defined paper categories. Following completion of the ramp-up phase of this potential further
paper mill, this would mean an increase of the total annual containerboard capacity of Paper from
currently approximately 1,100,000 tons to approximately 1,850,000 tons. The proposed new paper machine
(PM3) will have a 9.2m trim width, which would allow us to optimize containerboard production to meet
the requirements of the more modern corrugators with trim widths of 2.8m or 3.3m at most of our newer
corrugated board production sites, which would result in low volumes of cutting scrap and higher
productivity.

**BOARD**

Board encompasses our production of high-quality corrugated board at our ten production sites in the
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom, with a total annual production
capacity of approximately 1,440,000 tons of corrugated board.

More than 43% of our total corrugated board production capacity is located in Germany where we have a
total annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 620,000 tons at four different
production sites. Our German corrugated board production sites primarily serve the German market.

Our production site in Douvrin, France, has an annual corrugated board production capacity of
approximately 85,000 tons and primarily serves markets in France and in the Benelux countries.

Our plants in Rokycany, Czech Republic, Strykow and Trzcinica, Poland are well-positioned to serve
Eastern European markets. Our Rokycany site has an annual corrugated board production capacity of
approximately 140,000 tons and our Polish sites in Strykow and Trzcinica have an annual corrugated board
production capacity of approximately 170,000 and 125,000 tons, respectively.

The production at our new corrugated board production site in Drizzona, Italy commenced in early March
2018, with an annual corrugated board production capacity of approximately 100,000 tons. It marked our
entry into the largest corrugated sheet board market in Europe.

In addition, with the establishment of our new corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ in Ellesmere Port, United
Kingdom to replace our now decommissioned corrugated board production site located just a few
kilometers from the new site and its commencement of production in January 2019, we have now also
become a significant player in the market of the United Kingdom. This newest corrugated board
production site operates with a 3.35m trim width and has an annual corrugated board production capacity

145


-----

of more than 200,000 tons, more than double the production capacity of approximately 85,000 tons of the
old site, which we established in 2009 with a used corrugator with a 2.5m trim width.

We have already commenced construction of a further corrugated board production site (PW13) in Eisfeld,
Germany (with test production expected to start in the fourth quarter in 2019 or the first quarter of 2020).
In addition, we further expect to establish up to three further corrugated board production sites between
2020 and 2023 including a further corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14) which is envisaged to commence
production in late 2020 or early 2021.

Since the establishment of our Group, we have planned and developed our production sites primarily as
greenfield projects and, more recently, as packaging park projects to ensure the optimal geographic
location as well as a high technological standard for each site. Our Board operations focus on the efficient
and flexible production of customized small batch series, with a high degree of automation at all our
production sites, both with respect to the production process itself as well as order handling. We believe we
offer significant added value to our customers by offering fully automated online ordering, reliable and
just-in-time delivery within 24 hours for selected products and online order tracking. For more
information, see ‘‘—Information Technology and Process Management’’.

Our range of Board corrugated board products includes all customary single-wall, double-wall and
triple-wall flutes, and we have devoted significant time and efforts to developing a range of ‘‘next
generation’’ products which feature reduced raw material consumption while maintaining or even
improving technical specifications. For more information about these products, including next board� and
next box�, see ‘‘—Sustainability Focus; Research and Development’’.

In 2018, our Board operations generated A840.8 million in sales or 87.0% of our total sales in 2018. We
have established a strong and long-standing customer base, with some of our customer relationships dating
back to the beginning of our operations in 1992. We have grown with our large German customers and
have also successfully entered into new relationships with key customers outside of Germany. Today we
supply 350 to 400 different Board customers. In 2018, our five largest Board customers accounted for
approximately 20% and our ten largest Board customers for approximately 28% of our corrugated board
sales by volume. The same year, our largest single customer generated approximately 7% of our total
corrugated board sales by volume.

We have established long-term strategic business relationships with many of our largest corrugated board
customers. We believe that our ability to provide reliable delivery of high-quality, cost-effective and
tailor-made products and being a family-owned business have enabled us to foster strong partnerships of
mutual dependence with our mostly family-owned customers, operating as a fundamental part of their
supply chains by improving inventory management, security of supply and customer service. However,
consistent with industry practice, our business relationships are not governed by long-term agreements with
fixed prices and sales volumes.

We believe that our differentiated business model is particularly beneficial for many of our small to
medium-sized customers with a decentralized production. For some of our larger customers that purchase
a high percentage (typically 70% or more) of their corrugated board requirements from us, we offer
predictable pricing for our corrugated board products through index pricing arrangements. In addition, at
some of our corrugated board production sites, certain long-standing customers have established their own
box manufacturing plants in immediate proximity to our site, either on our own land or on land adjacent to
our site (so-called ‘‘packaging park’’). As a variation of this traditional packaging park model, we
commenced production in October 2015 at our corrugated board production site (PW9) in Pl¨ossberg,
Germany, which we established in immediate proximity to an existing packaging plant of our customer,
Liebensteiner Kartonagenwerk, on land owned by our customer. As a further variation of the packaging
park model, we commenced production in the first quarter of 2017 at our corrugated board production site
(PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland on land we purchased from our large customer Janmar Centrum adjacent to
its existing packaging plant. All versions of the packaging park model help us to further strengthen our
relationships with key customers and benefit both us and the relevant customers. The high level of
integration between our own corrugated board production and the box production of our customers also
made possible through the packaging park model creates a number of efficiencies and largely eliminates
freight and other logistics costs between Board and our packaging park customers. Our packaging park
customers also typically purchase a very high percentage (up to 100%) of their corrugated board
requirements for the relevant box plant from us, which means predictable, high volume orders and
consistently high utilization levels for the relevant corrugated board production sites. To ensure a

146


-----

predictable pricing mechanism for all parties, we also typically have index pricing arrangements with our
packaging park customers.

In 2018, approximately 11% of our total volume sales by surface area were generated under index pricing
arrangements with our customers. The prices under these arrangements are linked to a containerboard
market price index. Although these arrangements generally do not involve minimum sales volumes,
demand levels are typically stable and we are in regular contact with our customers to ensure we have
reasonable visibility over sales volumes for the upcoming year. In addition, approximately 19% of our
volume sales by surface area in 2018 were attributable to packaging park customers. Customers accounting
for approximately 69% of our volume sales by surface area in 2018 submitted their orders electronically
and communicated directly with our IT systems via e-box, which offers those customers certain benefits in
terms of order processing and tracking. It typically takes approximately two to three months for
containerboard mills to pass on their raw material price increases to their customers, i.e., manufacturers of
corrugated board. In turn, the manufacturers of corrugated board generally attempt to raise prices to
recover containerboard cost increases. It generally takes approximately two to three months for corrugated
board manufacturers, including us, to pass these increases on to their customers.

**PROCUREMENT/PURCHASING**

**Overview**

Our most important purchasing items include recycled paper, containerboard, energy and freight, which
collectively accounted for 75% of our total procurement volume in 2017 and 77% in 2018. For these
purposes, total procurement volume is defined as cost of material, other operating expenses and income
from passing through the cost of gas to Sales & Solutions GmbH.

The following table sets forth the total cost in euros for each of these items in the year ended
December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the three months ended March 31, 2018
and March 31, 2019 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2019:

(1) In addition to the cost of electricity, gas and steam, ‘‘Energy’’ also includes the cost of water and waste water treatment as well
as income from passing through the cost of gas to Sales & Solutions GmbH in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Therefore, energy cost
stated above differ from the energy cost shown as part of cost of materials.

(2) In 2016, we re-classified certain accounts within operating expenses in further development of our investor reporting. As a
result, the way we calculate freight expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 as presented in the table above differs
slightly from the way we previously calculated them.

Other procurement items, such as starch or maintenance services, accounted for an aggregate of
A143 million in 2017 and A152 million in 2018.

Most of our procurement and purchasing activities are concentrated in a centralized purchasing
organization at our headquarters in Landau, which is responsible for purchasing containerboard, freight
services, energy as well as other supplies. In addition, our two paper mills in Burg and Eisenh¨uttenstadt
have local purchasing departments that are responsible for ‘‘technical’’ purchases, including starch,
chemicals, maintenance services as well as other technical supplies. Our local purchasing department at
our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt also centrally handles all purchases of recycled paper for the Group. By
centralizing many of our purchasing activities, we aim to maximize our purchasing power, while at the
same time building a high degree of expertise. The markets and prices for the most important production
costs in our business, such as containerboard, energy and recycled paper, are driven by international supply
and demand and require Group-wide purchasing strategies in order to optimize results. Our strategies
include a mixture of mid-term supply contracts and spot purchasing of raw materials.

The main raw material for the production of containerboard is recycled paper. As described above, all
recycled paper for the Group is purchased centrally by our local purchasing department at our paper mill
in Eisenh¨uttenstadt. In 2017 and 2018, Paper purchased a total of approximately 1,133,000 tons and
1,121,000 tons, respectively, of recycled paper from a broad portfolio of more than 50 suppliers. Prices for
recycled paper have been highly volatile in the past. By improving our supplier portfolio management, we
have been able to improve our average purchasing conditions in recent years. In making our purchasing
decisions with respect to recycled paper, we can choose from a wide variety of suppliers. For the bulk
recycled paper grades B12 and B19, we have entered into long-term supply agreements with a volume of
1,163,200 tons, which we expect to cover effectively all our related requirements. We purchase
approximately 9% of our total recycled paper requirements under fixed volume contracts with a term of
between one and four years and either fixed prices or index-linked prices. For approximately 49% of our
total recycled paper purchases, we renegotiate prices on a monthly basis. Approximately 51% of our
recycled paper purchases involve prices linked to relevant indices, such as Euwid or indices published by
the German Federal Statistical Office (Statistisches Bundesamt).

The main input cost for our production of corrugated board is containerboard. In 2017 and 2018, Board
purchased approximately 1,073,000 tons and 1,227,000 tons, respectively, of containerboard.
Approximately 75% to 85% of which were supplied internally by Paper. The remainder was purchased

149


-----

from a portfolio of approximately 30 external containerboard suppliers. External purchases of
containerboard primarily involved purchases of kraftliner and white testliner. To reduce transportation
costs for shipments of containerboard from our paper mills to our corrugated board production sites, we
also enter into swap agreements with other containerboard producers from time to time. By maintaining a
high share of internally sourced containerboard, we can ensure a consistently high quality of the
containerboard we use, which has a positive impact on the operational performance of the equipment we
use in our corrugated board production processes. In addition, our own containerboard production
capabilities at Paper allow us to cater to the specific needs of our corrugated board production at Board.

**Energy**

The production of containerboard is very energy intensive. The operation of our two paper mills accounted
for 91% of the total energy consumption of all our production sites (i.e. not including energy consumption
of our headquarters in Landau) in 2018, and the operation of our ten corrugated board productions sites at
that time together with our CHP accounted for the remainder. Electricity and steam are the primary forms
of energy required for our production operations.

Notwithstanding increases in production volumes, our energy costs have declined in recent years for a
variety of reasons, including (i) our efforts to reduce energy consumption, in particular with regard to
PM2, (ii) falling energy prices, (iii) the optimization of our energy procurement processes, (iv) the
optimization of the operating costs of the CHP, in particular with regard to ash disposal, as well as (v) the
full utilization of all available accommodations, credits and refunds under applicable energy laws and
regulations. For more information about our energy management efforts, see ‘‘—Sustainability Focus;
_Research and Development’’._

In addition, the CHP ensures a reliable, long-term supply of steam to PM2. As a back-up solution for the
supply of steam in case of a maintenance or other shutdown of the CHP, a nearby power plant in
Eisenh¨uttenstadt can also supply steam to the PM2. The CHP Acquisition was a significant further step in
our efforts to optimize our cost structure as significantly reduced our energy costs as a result of the CHP
Acquisition. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—The CHP Acquisition’’. Other energy supply agreements we_
enter into typically have a maximum term of one year. For larger energy procurement quantities, we may
make use of tranche models to contract for annual volumes at different times, for different tranches and
prices of our total energy requirements and for different periods. This allows us to maintain a maximum
amount of flexibility to respond to changing market conditions.

**Freight/Logistics**

At each step of our internal value chain and production processes, we coordinate and monitor complex
logistics processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and products. This includes the shipment of
large rolls of containerboard from our two paper mills in Germany to our ten corrugated board production
sites in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom as well as the
shipment of our finished corrugated board to our customers in the packaging industry (box plants).

We meet our freight and logistics requirements mainly through the use of external logistics companies and,
to a much lesser extent, our own fleet of currently 59 trucks. Due to the relatively large size and weight of
our products compared to value, freight and logistics expenses play an important role in the profitability of
our business. The selection and commissioning of our external logistics partners is centrally organized by
our logistics department in Landau, supported by our logistics specialists at Logistics in Burg.

The support of our own team of logistics specialists at Logistics also provides us with real-time insight into
the latest developments in the market for transportation services, which allows us to strategically employ
the use of our own fleet of trucks. In addition, our own fleet gives us the ability to cover temporary capacity
constraints in the market. Other targeted optimization measures which have resulted in a reduction of
related transportation costs include (i) the development of specialized transport cradles for our
containerboard rolls, which allow for a more efficient use of the cargo hold of each truck, (ii) the hiring of
trucks with cargo holds best suited for our transportation needs, (iii) improved journey planning and
(iv) better coordination of loading and offloading times.

**SALES AND MARKETING**

Our sales team is tasked with achieving the sales, margin and volume targets defined by our management.
A central element of our sales efforts is the provision of strong customer support for our existing customer
base and the establishment and maintenance of strong relationships with purchasing managers and other
key decision makers within our customers’ organizations. Other key elements of our sales efforts involve
winning new customers, especially in new markets, and the introduction of new products.

To ensure we meet the targets defined by our management, we have implemented a sales management
system within our sales organization that is designed to monitor our performance against our volume
targets. In addition, we have implemented a centralized pricing system to ensure a proper framework for
achieving our sales and margin targets.

Our marketing team supports our sales team and provides it with market-focused concepts and a full set of
marketing tools. In addition to supporting the Group-wide targets defined by our management, our
marketing efforts are also aimed at further strengthening our product brands (e.g., Progroup Paper,
Progroup Board, Progroup Logistics, next fibre�, next board� and next box�) and maximizing their value.

A key condition for a consistent brand image is the presentation of a clear and consistent external
appearance, which we try to ensure through a full package of coordinated marketing tools and marketing
activities. We believe this also benefits our packaging customers, as it can help support their own product
marketing with their end-customers.

In 2018, our sales and marketing teams employed an average of 42 full-time employees (40 in 2017).

**INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT**

As described above, we principally generate revenue through the sale of containerboard and corrugated
board. Our mills primarily sell the containerboard we produce to Group-owned converting operations and
we sell our corrugated board to our third-party customers in the packaging industry. The operation of our
production plants as well as our sales and service activities depend on the efficient and uninterrupted
operation of complex and sophisticated computer, telecommunication and data processing systems.

Our value chain starts with recycled paper, which is the primary raw material in the production of
containerboard. In managing our supply of raw materials, we need to constantly monitor our internal
needs for containerboard, which we primarily meet through our own mills in Burg and Eisenh¨uttenstadt as
well as, to a much more limited extent, third party containerboard producers.

Between each of the further steps along the value chain and our production process, we need to coordinate
and monitor complex logistics processes to ensure the efficient flow of materials and products. This
includes the shipment of large rolls of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated board plants at ten
other locations in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom as well as
the shipment of our finished corrugated board to our customers in the packaging industry (box plants).

Our corrugated board plants process up to approximately 4,600 individual customer orders for corrugated
board each day with a total volume of approximately 9.88 million square meters. At each plant, we prepare
and load up to 90 truckloads of corrugated board every day.

Our IT infrastructure needs to be able to support all these processes, including by helping us to optimize:

  - our use of raw materials (raw material management);

  - our production planning and production control (minimization of cutting scrap);

  - our warehouse management for both raw materials and finished products; as well as

   - the coordination of loading and offloading times.

In 2018, approximately 69% of purchase orders for corrugated board from our Board customers were
received electronically (69% in 2017), and all material core processes, which need to be coordinated and
timed efficiently to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of our production processes, are being
controlled by our central WEPAFORM-server and by local WEPAFORM servers at each plant.

WEPAFORM is our proprietary core ERP system we use across the Group and which implements our
internal know-how in the form of best practices and rules of conduct. The functionality of WEPAFORM
covers all our core processes, including order processing, raw materials planning, production planning,
production control as well as warehousing, shipment and invoicing. WEPAFORM implements both the
rules of conduct of our individual departments as well as those rules of conduct that apply Group-wide,
which ensures the implementation of our Group-wide business strategies.

For example, in response to a requested delivery date in a customer purchase order, we try to automate, as
much as possible, the confirmation of the actual delivery date for products covered by the relevant order.
This actual delivery date will be determined based on a combination of factors, such as optimal
transportation planning (including with regard to load capacity, offloading times and punctuality) as well as
optimal production planning (i.e., feasibility and minimization of cutting scrap). This determination, in
turn, will take account of all other pending orders at the time as well as the availability of freight options.
All these complex determinations are controlled and automated through WEPAFORM.

While all our core processes are covered by our proprietary WEPAFORM system and we use our e-box
platform for purchase order related electronic communications with our Board customers, we also use a
number of additional software applications to support other business processes, including standard
non-proprietary applications for accounting (SAP), payroll processing (LOGA) and equipment
maintenance (MAXIMO) and transport management for Logistics (Carlo).

To support the various software applications we use within the Group, including WEPAFORM, we operate
our own data centers. Our main data center is located in Offenbach a.d. Queich, Germany, and is
connected to our headquarters in Landau, Germany, with a dedicated line. All our German sites are
connected via leased MPLS lines to our main data center, while our foreign production sites are connected
to our main data center via VPN over the Internet. At our site in Burg, Germany, we operate a local area
network (LAN) which connects our local containerboard (Board), corrugated board (Paper) and logistics
operations (Logistics) and which, in turn, is connected to our main data center via leased MPLS lines. To
reduce the risk of a disruption of individual Internet connections between our various facilities and our
main data center, we maintain alternative back-up Internet routes for each facility. Additionally, to ensure
business continuity on application level for our core production processes, we operate WEPAFORM
manufacturing execution processes edge datacenters in our plants in case of network issues. To host our
software applications, we use ESX-Server farm based on NETAPP Storage systems. Relevant software
applications are made available remotely to all users with the Progroup network via CITRIX XenApp.

In 2018, our IT department employed an average of 20 employees (16 in 2017), including management
positions, team leaders, administrative assistants and software developers. In addition, we worked with five
external IT consultants and, with regard to the non-proprietary applications we use, cooperated with the
relevant software developers and their partners. Given the strong reliance of our business on information
technology, the success of our business depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain qualified IT
personnel in the long-term, which has been challenging in the past given an increasing shortage of qualified
personnel, especially in Germany.

**SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT**

Promoting the sustainability of our core businesses, i.e., the production of containerboard and corrugated
board, has been a key priority for our Group, not only from an environmental perspective, but also as a
matter of pure economic necessity. Containerboard cannot generally be differentiated by producer, and
this standardization has led to intensified price competition within our industry. In addition, our operating
results are significantly impacted by the containerboard and corrugated board industry’s historical cyclical
pattern, with periods of overcapacity and resulting pressure on the pricing of our products. These pressures
can be further exacerbated by significant volatility in our key input costs, in particular the cost of recycled
paper, energy costs and freight costs.

As a result, we are forced to continuously improve our product designs, optimize the utilization of our
assets and explore new ways to further reduce our input costs. In practice, this means that we are
undertaking significant and ongoing efforts to further reduce the use of fibre (i.e., recycled paper) in our
products as well as the amount of energy required for our production processes and the shipment of our
products, which helps us both to maintain a cost leadership position within our industry (with the goal of
safeguarding our profit margins) and to help the environment by reducing our CO2 footprint.

As a result of the factors described above, we believe there are general ‘‘mega trends’’ towards lighter and
more functional packaging and towards a more efficient use of resources. The trend towards ‘‘light paper’’
(i.e., containerboard) has been particularly strong in Germany and has been further strengthened by high
growth rates in e-commerce, which have led to an increase in demand for light and safe packaging
solutions.

We believe that we are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on these trends with our paper mill in
Eisenh¨uttenstadt, Germany (PM2), which specializes in the production of super-light-weight to medium
152


-----

weight containerboard with grammages of 60-130g/m[2]. With regard to the production of super-light-weight
containerboard (with a grammage below 90g/m[2]), which is currently particularly sought-after in the market,
we believe that our paper machine PM2 gives us a significant advantage over many of our competitors,
both in terms of efficiency and product quality. Based on a study by Vision Hunters, we believe PM2 is
among the world’s most advanced paper machine for recycled super-light-weight paper and has set five
new world records since its launch in 2010. Our subsidiary Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, which operates
our paper mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt, is certified under the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (‘‘EMAS’’),
a voluntary scheme set up by the European Union that is designed to help companies to continuously
improve their environmental performance. The EMAS certification of Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH also
carries several advantages for our business. Among other advantages, it (i) results in simplified reporting
obligations under the German Federal Emission Law (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, ‘‘BImSchG’’),
(ii) allows us to take advantage of certain accommodations and credits under the German Renewable
Energy Law (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’) and the German Co-Generation Law (Kraft-W¨arme_Kopplungsgesetz, ‘‘KWKG’’), (iii) serves as the basis for certain energy tax refunds in Germany, (iv) allows_
us to take advantage of certain fee discounts in connection with certain regulatory approval processes in
Germany, and (v) generally improves our corporate image as an ‘‘eco-friendly’’ company. The current
EMAS certification for our mill in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and Progroup Power 1 GmbH is valid until July 4,
2020 and June 4, 2020, respectively .

To support the EMAS certification of Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH as well as other environmental
certifications and to generally improve our energy management, we have implemented energy
management systems (‘‘EnMS’’) at our two paper mills in Eisenh¨uttenstadt and Burg, the operation of
which is particularly energy intensive, as well as all of our corrugated board production sites. In addition to
the advantages described above, the implementation of EnMS at our various sites also has the following
benefits for our business: (i) it helps us monitor compliance with applicable environmental regulations,
(ii) increases the transparency of our internal production processes, (iii) enables a clear allocation of
internal responsibilities and tasks, (iv) serves as the basis for potential efficiency improvements by helping
us identify potential cost savings, and (v) reduces the risk of potential environmental liability. The
containerboard produced by both our two paper mills is also certified by the Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC).

In addition, we spent significant time, expense and effort developing a ‘‘green’’ range of ‘‘next generation’’
products working in a close cooperation with BHS Corrugated GmbH, one of our equipment suppliers,
and a team of researchers at the University of Applied Sciences (Hochschule f¨ur angewandte
_Wissenschaften) in Regensburg, Germany, over a period of several years. We market the resulting products_
under our own brands next fibre�, next board� and next box�. All these product innovations involve the
use of the super-light-weight containerboard produced by our paper machine PM2 as well as innovative
flute designs/corrugated board formats.

Next fibre� is the brand under which we market a new generation of super-light-weight containerboard
produced by our paper machine PM2. Our goal in developing this new generation of containerboard was to
minimize the amount of fibre and energy used in its production, while at the same time maximizing its
performance. The result of our efforts is a much lighter containerboard with consistently high paper
homogeneity and a much optimized production process in terms of energy consumption, repulping and
moisture monitoring. In addition, T UV Rheinland, an independent German standards organization,[¨]
certified significant reductions in the CO2 footprint for our next fibre� containerboard, specifically a 52%
reduction in CO2 emissions per ton of paper produced compared to conventional containerboard. In
addition, next fibre� containerboard features significantly more roll weight running meters per
containerboard roll during transport as a result of the reduced weight, resulting in further reductions in
CO2 emissions by 11% and 24% for grammages of 90g/m[2] and 80g/m[2], respectively.

Next board� is the brand under which we market our new generation of corrugated board products
produced with our next fibre� containerboard. Due to a combination of the use of the lighter
containerboard and innovative and improved flute designs and general board architecture, this range of
corrugated boards is not only lighter than conventional corrugated board, but also offers our customers
better performance characteristics, a better surface and printability, lower logistics costs and a better
life-cycle assessment. The improvements due to the new board designs include edge crush resistance
(ECT) values which are up to 15% higher compared to conventional corrugated board with the same
weight/raw material content. Next board� products also feature an average reduction in CO2 emissions per
ton of corrugated board of 15% compared to conventional corrugated board, as certified by T UV[¨]
Rheinland, a 5% reduction in CO2 emissions during transport and a 16% increase in the loadable

153


-----

corrugated board surface area, meaning that approximately one in every seven truck journey can
potentially be avoided.

Next box� is a label we make available to our packaging customers they can use for eco-friendly and
sustainable packaging produced with our next board� corrugated board products. Next board� corrugated
board allows for more exact processing compared to comparable conventional corrugated board, as well as
more reliable machinability and higher running rates. Next box� packaging features a smooth look without
any ripple effect and permits optimal printing results due to our improved corrugated board designs. In
addition, next box� products allow for more efficient storage and reduce transportation costs due to the
reduced raw material content. We believe that sustainability and eco-friendliness are of increasing
importance to our customers, especially in Germany. To allow our customers in the packaging industry as
well as their end-users to highlight their own commitment to sustainability, we therefore make our next
box�—reduced CO2 label available to them, which can be stamped on all next box� packaging.

**EMPLOYEES**

In 2018 we employed an average of 1,096 employees (excluding trainees) in six countries (1,040 for the
year ended December 31, 2017). Approximately 71% of our employees are employed at our headquarters
in Landau, Germany, and at our six production sites in Germany. As of December 31, 2018, we had
314 employees outside of Germany, including 48 employees in France, 60 employees in the Czech
Republic, 119 employees in Poland, 61 employees in the United Kingdom and 42 in Italy.

Our workforce is characterized by low fluctuation levels, and the average job tenure of our employees
across all our sites is seven years. As a result of our continuous hiring strategy and long-standing training
programs, we believe our workforce currently has a well-balanced age structure. As of December 31, 2018,
we had 34 trainees.

With the exception of our employees in France and at Progroup Power 1 GmbH, our workforce is not
subject to any collective bargaining agreements and there are no works councils. In accordance with the
French Works Constitution Act, a works council represents our employees at our corrugated board
production site in Douvrin, France. At Progroup Power 1 GmbH our employees are also represented by a
works council.

**INSURANCE**

We maintain various insurance policies for different aspects of our business. These policies are centrally
managed by our legal and insurance department in Landau, with the support of our insurance broker S&P
Schulz & Partner GmbH, Mannheim. Our insurance coverage includes all-risk policies insuring against
property destruction, damage and loss, as well as against any business interruption directly resulting from
any property damage. In addition, we maintain liability insurance coverage with regard to general
operating liability, radiation liability and environmental liability, as well as transport and accident
insurance. We obtain insurance coverage for particular risks based on an internal risk analysis. We believe
that we maintain adequate insurance coverage commensurate with our business and production volumes
and in line with industry practice, with deductibles and coverage limits that we believe to be reasonable and
appropriate. We continuously re-evaluate the appropriateness of our insurance coverage in the ordinary
course. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not suffer losses that may either not be covered
by insurance or that may exceed the coverage amount under the relevant insurance policies.

**REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT**

Our business, and in particular the operation of our production sites, is subject to various regulatory
requirements. Applicable laws and regulations may differ from site to site due to different national and
local laws. The regulatory requirements relate in particular to our production processes and include, inter
_alia, laws and regulations relating to health and safety measures for employees, the technical safety_
requirements for operating machines, the use and handling of chemicals, air and water emissions, soil
contamination and the management and disposal of waste, hazardous and toxic substances and other
materials. For our sites and operations, we are required to obtain and hold various permits and to comply
with the requirements specified therein. We are further subject to foreign trade laws and may be required
to pay export duties or customs duties on materials and products that we export and import. We are subject
to further regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including antitrust laws and zoning
and occupancy laws that generally apply to manufacturing businesses and/or govern the promotion and
sale of the products we offer, the operation of our facilities and our relationships with customers, suppliers

154


-----

and competitors. The following is an overview of the main laws and regulations that are relevant to our
activities in Germany. Local laws and regulations that deal with similar aspects apply in other jurisdictions
in which we operate production sites or sell our products.

**Environmental Laws**

We are required to comply with various environmental laws and regulations. In particular, our operations
are subject to laws and regulations designed to limit emissions. In Germany, the construction and
operation of our paper mills requires active permits under the Federal Emissions Protection Act (Bundes_Immissionsschutzgesetz, ‘‘BImSchG’’), which encompasses various approvals necessary for the construction_
and operation of facilities pursuant to other laws, including public-law approvals, registrations and
consents. The operation of the relevant facility can generally not be challenged or contested by third
parties as long as the respective facility operates in compliance with its permit. In such cases, third parties
can only require certain measures to mitigate any negative impact of a facility on the environment. To the
extent such measures are impossible or uneconomical to implement based on state-of-the-art technology,
the relevant third parties may only claim damages. Permits and additional administrative orders under the
Federal Emissions Protection Act may impose certain limitations (e.g., stricter requirements with regard to
permissible emissions or the use of the relevant facilities), with which we have to comply. To the extent new
legal standards are introduced, permits will not be grandfathered but adjusted so they meet the relevant
new standards. A violation of the operator’s duties as determined in the respective permit (or an additional
administrative order) or a modification of the relevant legal standards may also lead to a restriction or, in
severe cases, a prohibition of the further operation of the facility and/or the revocation of its permit under
certain circumstances. The competent authority may also impose administrative fines or even ask for
removal of the facility.

Moreover, the operation of our two paper mills is subject to the various duties of the Federal Water
Management Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz, ‘‘WHG’’), the State Water Acts in each of the German states
(Landeswassergesetze) and the respective federal and/or state ordinances (Rechtsverordnungen). These
regulations govern our use of water during production. According to the Federal Water Management Act,
as well as the corresponding State (L¨ander) laws, the use of water generally requires the approval by the
competent authority. In particular, the extraction of above-ground water, the discharge of waste water and
the pouring and discharge of materials are all aspects of our containerboard production that require
regulatory approval. In cases of violations of the relevant provisions, we may be required to pay damages
or become subject to penalties. Depending on the type of permit, it may be limited in time and it may
either be revoked any time or only under certain circumstances.

The CHP in Eisenh¨uttenstadt (Power) also requires various regulatory approvals for its operation,
particularly under the BImSchG and the 17[th] Ordinance to the BImSchG on the incineration and
co-incineration of waste. Furthermore, operations have to comply with the applicable greenhouse gas
emissions caps. See ‘‘—Regulation governing the Operation of the CHP—Environmental laws and other
_related laws and regulations’’ and ‘‘—Regulation governing the Operation of the CHP—Carbon Emission_
_compliance’’ below._

Both our paper mills are subject to the German Radiation Protection Ordinance
(Strahlenschutzverordnung, ‘‘StrlSchV’’) due to the fact that our paper machines include various measuring
devices (e.g., for measuring paper basis weights, paper moisture and/or paper ash) that rely on the use of a
number of slightly radioactive isotopes (i.e., Cobalt-60, Krypton-85, Cesium-137 and/or Iron-55). The use
of these materials and devices is common in the paper industry as well as in other industries. They are
applied in enclosed form, i.e., isotopes are enclosed by a protective cover to avoid any release of radiation.
When the isotopes are not in use, they are further shielded with steel plates. According to Sec. 7 of the
Radiation Protection Ordinance, the handling of the relevant radioactive isotopes requires permits, which
we have obtained. Even if these permits would be revoked, however, we would be able to switch to using
different measuring devices based on different technologies. We also maintain insurance coverage for
liability resulting from radiation.

**Waste Legislation and Regulations**

The use of waste (as a substitute fuel within Power’s CHP) is subject to European and German waste
legislation. Among others, the German Act on the Federal Waste Management Act
(Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz, ‘‘KrWG’’) and corresponding regulation, such as the Packaging Act
(Verpackungsgesetz, ‘‘VerpackG’’) and the List of Wastes Ordinance (Abfallverzeichnisverordnung, ‘‘AVV’’),

155


-----

stipulate certain standards and requirements. Apart from that, the use of waste containing
Hexabromcyclododecan (‘‘HBCD’’), which is, inter alia, contained in insulation boards that in the past have
been used as a substitute fuel within the CHP, was subject to usage restrictions and additional
documentation requirements under the Regulation (EC) No. 850/2004 on persistent organic pollutants
(‘‘POP Regulation’’). Power has held meetings with its suppliers to resolve potential issues in this respect.

**Chemicals Legislation and Regulations**

We use a number of chemicals in our production processes and are therefore subject to Regulation (EC)
No. 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals
(‘‘REACH’’). The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment
through better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. REACH places
greater responsibility on industry participants to manage the risks from chemicals and to provide safety
information on the substances. As a ‘‘downstream user’’ pursuant to REACH, we are primarily required to
adhere to the recommended risk reduction measures, to forward our customers and suppliers the relevant
information and, if necessary, to arrange for a chemical safety report to be prepared.

In addition, we are subject to the provisions of the German Chemicals Act (Gesetz zum Schutz vor
_gef¨ahrlichen Stoffen—Chemikaliengesetz, ‘‘ChemG’’) and related ordinances (Rechtsverordnungen). The_
Chemicals Act is intended to minimize the risks from chemicals for humans and the environment. Based
on the Chemicals Act and related regulations, the competent authorities have the power to—among
others—require that certain materials or chemicals (i) may either not be produced, marketed or used at
all, (ii) may only be produced, marketed or used in a certain manner or for specific purposes, (iii) may only
be used under certain circumstances or (iv) may only be distributed to certain persons. We are not aware of
any such orders having been issued by the German government authorities that would have an impact on
our business.

**Soil Contamination**

Pursuant to the German Federal Soil Protection Act _(Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz, ‘‘BBodSchG’’), the_
responsibility for residual pollution and harmful changes to the soil lies with the party who caused a
harmful soil change or a contaminated site, its universal successor, the relevant property owner, the
occupant of the relevant real property and, if the title was transferred after March 1, 1999, the previous
owner of the property, if they knew or must have known about the contamination. There is no general
statutory ranking as to which of the aforementioned parties is primarily liable. Rather, this decision is
made at the discretion of the relevant local authority who will take into account the effectiveness of
remediation as a prevailing factor. Thus, the current owner of the contaminated property is usually the first
party to be held responsible because the owner is generally in the best position to undertake the necessary
remediation work. However, the other responsible parties are required to indemnify the party that carried
out the remediation work, regardless of which party is held liable by the relevant local authority. Where no
other arrangements are agreed upon, the obligation to provide compensation and the extent of the
compensation to be provided depend on the extent to which the hazard or damage was caused primarily by
one party or the other. Liability is not based on fault. Thus, the BBodSchG does not require the relevant
local authority to prove negligence or intent on the part of the liable parties.

According to the BBodSchG the competent authority may require risk inspections, investigations, remedial
measures and other measures necessary for the prevention of residual pollution or harmful changes in the
soil.

**Regulation governing the Operation of the CHP**

**_General overview_**

As a result of the CHP Acquisition, we are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations specifically
governing the German energy sector.

The key legislation containing the core provisions of German energy law is the Energy Industry Act (Gesetz
_¨uber die Elektrizit¨ats- und Gasversorgung—Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, ‘‘EnWG’’)._

Other laws and ordinances specifically relevant to the energy sector and the CHP include:

(i) the Co-Generation Act (Kraft-W¨arme-Kopplungsgesetz, ‘‘KWKG’’);

(ii) the Ordinance on Tariffs for Electricity Grid Access (Stromnetzentgeltverordnung, ‘‘StromNEV’’);

156


-----

(iii) the Ordinance on Incentive Regulation (Anreizregulierungsverordnung, ‘‘ARegV’’);

(iv) the Federal Emission Protection Act (Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz, ‘‘BImSchG’’);

(v) the Green House Gas Permission Trading Act (Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz, ‘‘TEHG’’);

(vi) the Energy Tax Act/Electricity Tax Act (Energiesteuergesetz/Stromsteuergesetz, ‘‘EnergieStG’’/
‘‘StromStG’’);

(vii) the Energy Services Act (Energiedienstleistungsgesetz, ‘‘EDL-G’’) and

(viii)the Electricity Grid Access Ordinance (Stromnetzzugangsverordnung, ‘‘StromNZV’’).

**_Energy Industry Act (EnWG) and related regulation_**

The EnWG provides, inter alia, the legal framework for ensuring competition within the German energy
markets, mainly by regulating electricity and gas networks to ensure reliable and efficient supply networks.
It also implements relevant EU law in relation to energy supply. Companies that supply third parties with
energy or own or operate transmission and distribution networks have to ensure that electricity is supplied
in accordance with these aims.

_Grid access and network tariffs_

As grid operators enjoy a natural monopoly, electricity grid operators are obligated to provide connection
to and use of electricity grids without discrimination and in a transparent manner.

Electricity grid operators are required to connect third parties, such as generation facilities (including the
CHP), to the grid. The conditions for a connection must be non-discriminatory, proportionate, transparent
and not less favorable than the conditions granted to a grid operator’s own, affiliated or associated
undertakings. A grid operator may refuse the connection if it is, for operational or other economic or
technical reasons, impossible or unreasonable. The burden of proving that a connection is economically or
technically impossible or unreasonable lies with the grid operator.

Tariffs for grid access are determined by the grid operators in accordance with incentive regulation based
on the ARegV and the StromNEV. Under these regulations, revenue caps are set by the regulatory
authority for each grid operator for a regulatory period of up to five years based on the cost base of the
business three years prior to the start of the regulatory period. The revenue cap displays the average total
costs of the grid use in consideration of permanent non influenceable costs (e.g. tax, duties), temporary
non influenceable costs, and influenceable costs (also referred to as ‘‘inefficiencies’’). Besides potential
profit from cost reductions, the grid operators can gain a reasonable interest from the used capital. The
provisions of the StromNEV and the Ordinance on Tariffs for Gas Grid Access (Gasnetzentgeltverordnung)
define how to assess the level of the equity interest rate (Eigenkapitalverzinsung) before each regulation
period. The equity interest rates are set by the German Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur,
‘‘BNetzA’’). For the third regulation periods for gas (2018 to 2022) and for electricity (2019 to 2023), the
BNetzA has significantly reduced the equity interest rates. These amendments have led to significant
controversies within the energy industry and appeals have been filed at the competent Higher Regional
Court of D¨usseldorf (Oberlandesgericht D¨usseldorf, ‘‘OLG D¨usseldorf’’) by distribution and transmission
system operating companies that are or will be affected by the decrease of the equity interest rate.
According to the ruling of the OLG D¨usseldorf of March 22, 2018 the reduction of the equity interest rates
was unlawful. Currently, the case is pending before the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof, ‘‘BGH’’), after the BNetzA had lodged an appeal against the OLG D¨usseldorf’s ruling.
A decision is announced to be released on July 9, 2019.

_Grid operators’ rights in case of congestion and emergency_

Pursuant to the EnWG, electricity grid operators are obliged to ensure the security and reliability of the
grid. Therefore, they are entitled and required to take the necessary actions to avoid any risks to the
security or reliability of the grid. If the security or reliability of the grid is endangered or disturbed, grid
operators are required and authorized to rectify the problem by making use of (i) grid-related measures,
which entail technical measures that do not involve the network users, such as internal energy balancing or
pressure adjustment; and/or (ii) market-related measures which involve certain network users. Marketrelated measures are based on contractual agreements between the grid operator and certain users relating
to the feed in and off-take of energy which allow energy balancing and making use of interruptible
capacities (capacity bookings which are not firm and, therefore, may be interrupted). If the grid operator

157


-----

cannot eliminate the disturbance by making use of any of these measures, the operator is entitled to adjust
and/or reduce feed-ins, electricity transits and electricity off-takes without any obligation to pay
compensation. In principle, feed-ins from conventional generation must be reduced before feed-ins from
co-generation facilities (such as the CHP) or renewable energy facilities. However, if the grid operator has
unreasonably rejected proposals by generation installation operators to conclude agreements on
interruptible capacities, compensation must be paid by the grid operator. Furthermore, compensation must
be paid to co-generation and renewable energy installations in case of a reduction of feed-ins if
disturbances are caused due to grid congestion.

_Relevant Amendments of the EnWG and related developments since 2016_

In 2016, the EnWG was amended by the Electricity Market Act (Strommarktgesetz), inter alia, to
strengthen the principle of free pricing in the electricity markets, to establish the basis for further reporting
requirements for market participants (including power plant operators) under a central electronic
directory of energy-related data (the so-called _Marktstammdatenregister (‘‘MaStR’’)), and to implement_
certain safety measures regarding capacity reserves (namely the so-called ‘‘Kraftwerksreserve’’, ‘‘Netzreserve’’
and the ‘‘Braunkohlereserve’’) to ensure the availability of sufficient power capacity. In adopting the
amendments, the German legislator essentially affirmed the existing market model (Energy-only-Market,
‘‘EOM’’), rejecting calls to implement a wide capacity market in response to recent turbulences for
conventional (co-generation) power plant operators caused by the increases in renewable energy
generation and the significant drop in prices in the electricity wholesale markets. Based on Sections 111e
and 111f of the EnWG, the regulation on the _MaStR (Marktstammdatenregisterverordnung, ‘‘MaStRV’’)_
entered into force on July 1, 2017. All actors in the electricity and gas market must register in the directory
(Marktstammdatenregister, ‘‘MaSTR’’) for all stationary technical facilities that generate, store or consume
electricity or gas. The MaStR creates a comprehensive regulatory register for the electricity and gas market
that can be used by public authorities and market actors in the energy sectors. The recourse to the master
data of the MaStR represents a significant increase in data quality and data simplification for many energy
industry processes. Many regulatory reporting requirements can be standardized, simplified or completely
abolished by centralized registration. The MaStR is still under construction. Electricity and gas network
operators can only currently register their company in the MaStR web portal. The MaStR has been opened
to the market players on January 31, 2019. All market players, depending on the date of their
commissioning process (before/after July 1, 2017), are obliged to register or to verify the existing data, at
the latest by January 31, 2021.

To further support the functioning of electricity markets, the German Renewable Energies Act
(Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, ‘‘EEG’’) has also been revised multiple times. The most significant
amendments include the definition of expansion targets and the progressive transition to a comprehensive
tendering system for all renewable energy technologies. The EEG provides for certain exemptions from
the energy surcharge for energy-intensive industries. In 2016, the EEG was amended, lowering the
required electricity cost intensity for such exemptions from 17% to 14% as of 2017 for certain industries,
such as the manufacture of paper and containerboard. The exemptions in the EEG have to comply with
the European environmental energy state aid guidelines which are valid until 2020 in the current version.
Furthermore, the German provisions have to meet the requirements established by the
Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (Renewable Energy
Directive). Further amendments of the EEG 2016 came into force on January 1, 2017 (‘‘EEG 2017’’). The
EEG 2017 contains two essential innovations. The remuneration of renewable electricity will primarily be
regulated by tenders in future, i.e. the amount of subsidy will be determined by the market and no longer
by fixed feed-in remuneration. That ensures the continuous expansion of renewable energies and can
reduce the costs of funding provided there is enough competition. Furthermore, the expansion of
renewable energies is synchronized with grid expansion. For each technology, certain expansion paths have
been set in accordance to the available network capacities. In addition, the expansion of wind power on
land in areas with network bottlenecks (Netzengpassgebiete) was limited. Most recently, the EEG has been
amended by a comprehensive legislative package, the so-called _Energiesammelgesetz (‘‘EnSaG’’), which_
includes amendments of different laws in Germany and entered into force at the end of 2018. As regards
the EEG, among others, the expansion paths for wind onshore and photovoltaics have been adjusted.
Further, additional tenders regarding these technologies for the years 2019 to 2021 have been
implemented. Also, the so-called innovation tenders have been upgraded through larger tender volumes,
while the funding tariffs for rooftop photovoltaic systems have been cut. For the self-production of
electricity, which under certain conditions is (partially) exempt from the so-called EEG-Umlage (the EEG
surcharge), provisions on the metering (or estimate) of own and of third-party electricity consumptions

158


-----

have been introduced. In light of a recent judgment of the European Court of Justice of March 28, 2019,
according to which the EEG (2012) does not contain subsidies, it is conceivable that the legal framework
will further be revised by the German legislator taking into account that the strict requirements under state
aid law do not (directly) apply to the German funding system.

Apart from the amendments of the EnWG and the EEG, (already in 2016) the foundation was laid for the
digital transformation of the energy system. With the Act on the Digitization of the Energiewende (Gesetz
_zur_ _Digitalisierung_ _der_ _Energiewende—‘‘GDEW’’),_ the Metering Point Operation Act
(Messstellenbetriebsgesetz—‘‘MSbG’’) has been enacted, which contains provisions on the progressive
roll-out of intelligent metering systems. However, implementation has so far been slow.

Besides the developments on German national level, the European legislation has also been amended. On
November 30, 2016, the European Commission published a proposal for a revised Renewable Energy
Directive (COM(2016) 767 final) to make the EU a global leader in renewable energy and ensure that a
target of at least 27% renewables in the gross final energy consumption in the EU by 2030 is met. On
January 17, 2018 the European Parliament adopted various amendments to the European Commission’s
proposal, in particular, to achieve an even more ambitious target of 35% renewables in the Union’s energy
consumption by 2030. On December 11, 2018 the European Parliament and the Council of the European
Union passed the Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (Renewable Energy Sources Directive), which entered into
force on December 24, 2018. The Member States are now required to implement this Directive by June 30,
2021 at the latest.

In the context of the general reforms of the EnWG and the EEG it is noteworthy for conventional
(co-generation) power plant operators, that the BNetzA and the European Regulation Authority (Agency
for the Cooperation of the Energy Regulators—‘‘ACER’’) paved the way for a split of the common
German-Austrian pricing zone from October 2018 by ordering grid operators to establish a congestion
management at the German-Austrian border. This is due to the technical difficulties and the exploding
costs regarding renewable energy that is being produced in the northern regions of Germany and
transported to the high-consumption centers in the southern regions of Germany. If the common GermanAustrian pricing are ultimately split, this may result in higher wholesale electricity prices in the South of
Germany.

_Network Fees Modernization Act (NEMoG)_

On July 22, 2017, the Act on the Modernization of the Grid Tariff Structure
(Netzentgeltmodernisierungsgesetz, ‘‘NEMoG’’) slightly amended the EnWG, the EEG and the StromNEV
to align grid tariffs with the ‘‘Energiewende’’. The NEMoG contains two important aspects: The gradual
standardization of transmission network charges and the abolishment of the privilege of the so-called
‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ (vermiedene Netzentgelte).

The transmission grid tariffs will gradually adjust nationwide. For implementation, the NEMoG contains
an authorization for the enactment of a regulation by the German Federal Government (Bundesregierung)
with consent of the German Federal Council (Bundesrat). The standardization of transmission grid tariffs
will be effected in five steps starting from January 1, 2019. From January 1, 2023, the charges for the
transmission grids will be uniform throughout Germany. The costs of the transmission grids currently
amount to approx. 25% of the total costs of electricity grids.

Furthermore, Section 120 EnWG stipulates the gradual reduction of ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’, the calculation
bases of which will be frozen to the level of 2016 starting from 2018. Regarding the gradual reduction, a
distinction is made between volatile (sun and wind) plants (Anlagen mit volatiler Erzeugung) and
controllable generation plants (e.g. CHP). The ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ for new volatile plants are completely
abolished since 2018 and for existing volatile plants it will be eliminated in three stages from 2018, i.e. that
by 2020, volatile plants will no longer be eligible for ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ at all. Regarding controllable
plants, ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ will not be granted to plants, which start their operation after December 31,
2022.

**_Co-Generation Act (KWKG)_**

In the interests of energy conservation, environmental protection and achieving the climate protection
targets of the German Federal Government, the KWKG aims to increase the share of electricity generated
through more environmentally-friendly co-generation facilities, such as the CHP, to 25% of the overall
power generation in Germany by 2020. However, due to the drop in the wholesale electricity prices and

159


-----

due to the ongoing discussions on conventional electricity production, the 25%-target—as of now—will not
be achieved.

_Grid access and off-take_

Grid operators are required to give priority grid access to certain co-generation plant operators, including
Progroup Power 1 GmbH as operator of the CHP, with the same priority as that granted to renewable
energies and to off-take, transmit and distribute their co-generation electricity on a priority basis. Grid
operators are required to off-take the electricity at (i) a price either mutually agreed or determined
according to the ‘‘standard market price’’ (if no agreement is reached) plus (ii) a certain fixed surcharge
and a payment for decentralized feed-in. See ‘‘—Off-take pricing’’ below.

Notwithstanding the obligation to purchase, transmit and distribute electricity from co-generation plants
and producers of renewable energy, a grid operator is required to ensure the technical stability of the grid
and, for this purpose, is entitled to avoid an overload of the grid by managing the feed-in of electricity from
all parties feeding electricity into its grid (feed-in/grid congestion management). If after exhausting certain
grid-related and market-related measures, the grid operator has not successfully reduced the overload in
the grid and congestion remains, it is entitled to reduce the electricity which can be fed into the grid.
Within this mandatory reduction, the grid operator is required to treat the electricity from certain
co-generation sources (including the CHP), from renewable energy sources (such as wind farms or solar
energy) and from mine gas preferentially. The grid operator is required to implement congestion
management by which, in principle, feed-in from installations using conventional energy resources (gas,
coal, nuclear fuel) must be reduced first. The political parties forming the current German Federal
Government have indicated in their coalition agreement that they intend to amend the legal framework for
congestion management (including the rules for compensation, if any, to be paid) while maintaining the
general concept of priority access for electricity from renewable sources, as well as from co-generation.

In December 2016, the European Commission published the so-called Winter Package, which includes
numerous proposals on legislative acts for energy efficiency and the energy markets. Among other
proposal, the package includes a proposal to cancel the priority feed-in for co-generation and renewable
energy plants with a capacity of more than 250 kilowatt, which start operating after the implementation of
the legislative acts.

_Off-take pricing_

The grid operator has an obligation to off-take the electricity produced at co-generation plants within the
meaning of the KWKG, such as the CHP, at a price mutually agreed between the grid operator and the
operator of the co-generation plant plus a surcharge. See ‘‘—Surcharge’’ below. In addition to the
surcharge, the grid operator is required to pay so-called ‘‘avoided grid fees’’ due to the decentralized
feed-in by the co-generation plant (‘‘Entgelt f¨ur dezentrale Einspeisung’’, Section 18 para 1 StromNEV). If
no agreement is reached regarding the electricity price, the grid operator has to off-take the electricity at
the ‘‘standard market price’’. The ‘‘standard market price’’ for electricity produced by installations depends
on their capacity. For installations with a capacity of up to 2 MWe the average price of base-load electricity
is determined by the European Energy Exchange (EEX) during the previous quarter of the year or
installations with a capacity of more than 2 MWe—like the CHP—the ‘‘standard market price’’ (depends
on the circumstances in the individual case, especially the plant’s mode of operation and the predictability
of electricity production).

If the co-generation plant operator demonstrates that a third party would be willing to pay a certain price
for the electricity produced at the co-generation plant, the grid operator is obligated to purchase the
electricity from the co-generation plant operator at this price. In turn, the third party is obliged to purchase
the electricity at the price quoted from the grid operator. Thus, the sale of electricity to a third party is
carried out through the grid operator as intermediary. The purchase price is actually paid by the third party
and the grid operator only pays the surcharge. See ‘‘—Surcharge’’ below.

_Surcharge_

In addition to the purchase price and the ‘‘avoided grid fees’’, grid operators are obligated to pay a legally
determined surcharge to the co-generation plant operators, depending, inter alia, on the type of plant, the
installed capacity and extent/costs of modernization and retrofitting measures. In contrast to the electricity
price and the ‘‘avoided grid fee’’, which the grid operator is only required to pay for the electricity actually
fed into the grid, the surcharge must be paid for the entire amount of electricity produced in

160


-----

co-generation. Depending on the type of the co-generation plant, the surcharge is payable for a certain
maximum period of time. Plants with a capacity larger than 2 MWe receive the surcharge for a total of
30,000 hours of Full-Load equivalent (FLE).

The KWKG places a cap on the annual aggregate level of financial incentives paid as surcharge under the
KWKG. If this threshold is exceeded, surcharges for a certain class of co-generation plants are reduced.
Subject to the cap, this loss in surcharges is generally paid in the full amount in the course of the following
years before payment of the regular surcharge for these co-generation plants is initiated again.

_Amendments of the KWKG and Associated Developments_

The KWKG was amended in recent time.

  - The KWKG 2016, which entered into force on January 1, 2016, amended the previous scheme of
funding co-generation, albeit maintaining the rules on grid access and compulsory off-taking of
electricity produced in co-generation. For the newly determined expansion paths, the cap for the
annual aggregate level of financial incentives was raised from A750 million to A1,500 million.

  - On January 1, 2017, an amendment to the KWKG 2016 entered into force. Most importantly, a
tendering system similar to the one under the revised EEG has been established for co-generation
plants with an electric capacity of 1 to 50 megawatt as well as for innovative CHP systems. This
mainly concerns combined heat and power plants (including the CHP), which feed into the general
supply network. Furthermore, the scheme for the reduction of the so-called _KWK-Umlage (a_
surcharge, which socializes the costs for the funding of CHP to the end consumers of electricity) for
the electricity-intensive industries was adapted to the one in place for the so-called _EEG-Umlage._
For more information, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Industry and our Business—As a result
_of the CHP Acquisition, we are directly subject to a wide range of laws and regulations specifically_
_governing the German energy sector and the disposal of waste, which are subject to constant change’’._

  - The most recent amendment of the KWKG was introduced by the above-mentioned EnSaG, which
entered into force by the end of 2018. With this act, among others, the funding of the construction
and modernization of CHP installations was extended to 2025.

In addition to these KWKG reforms, the German legislator passed the NeMoG, which includes a revision
of Section 18 StromNEV regarding ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’. In particular, a cap was placed on ‘‘avoided grid
tariffs’’ to prevent the relevant tariffs from exceeding the 2016 level. Also it was stipulated to progressively
cancel the ‘‘avoided grid tariffs’’ for existing respectively for new plants. For details, see ‘‘—NeMoG’’
above.

**_Carbon Emission Compliance_**

Germany is party to the Kyoto Protocol as well as to the Paris Agreement, and the Emission Trading
Directive 2003/87/EC intends to considerably reduce the output of greenhouse gases. It was transformed
into German law by implementing it into the German Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Act
(Treibhausgas-Emissionshandelsgesetz, ‘‘TEHG’’). The TEHG introduces an emission trading system
(‘‘ETS’’) for CO2 emission allowances which are traded in certain trading periods, which requires certain
energy and industry sectors to comply with the applicable greenhouse gas emissions caps. Overall, only a
limited number of allowances—determined in advance for the trading period—are available to emission
sources, subject to the emission trading system. Participation in this system has been mandatory since 2005
for all industries with high energy consumption levels, including the paper industry. The regulations of the
TEHG state that sources under emission trading obligation are required to obtain approval to emit
greenhouse gases, to comply with a cap of emission allowances allocated to them and to maintain a
monitoring process to determine and to document their emissions. The legislation also provides for the
possibility of trading (selling and buying) excess allowances in the open market and allows for offsets from
Joint Implementation and Clean Development Mechanism projects as regulated by the German Project
Mechanisms Act to be used in place of emission allowances to a certain extent, which is limited for existing
installations to the quota granted for the second trading period (22% of the allocation for the second
trading period), to the extent not yet used. Like our two paper mills, the CHP is subject to the ETS.

The overall availability of emission allowances allocated free of charge has been significantly reduced
during the second trading period (2008 through 2012) and the third trading period that began in January
2013 compared to the amount of allowances allocated free of charge in the first trading period (2005
through 2007). Under the currently applicable ETS, the EU-wide quantity of emission allowances allocated

161


-----

each year reduced by a linear factor of 1.74% annually as compared to the average annual total quantity of
emission allowances issued in the EU between 2008 and 2012. To achieve the target of cutting EU
emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990, agreed by the European Council in October 2014 as part of
the 2030 climate and energy framework, the cap will be lowered by 2.2% per year from 2021. In addition,
from 2013 onwards, the auctioning of emission allowances has been and will continue to be introduced for
the manufacturing sector. The quantities of emission allowances allocated free of charge will generally be
reduced from 80% in 2013 to 30% in 2020.On March 14, 2018, the 2018 Directive (EU) 2018/410
amending the Emissions Trading Directive 2003/87/EC was adopted. According to the amended version of
the Emissions Trading Directive, the free allocation of 30% will continue until 2025. Thereafter, the 30%
of free allocation will subsequently be reduced to 0% until 2030, except for district heating. As a result,
affected companies whose emissions exceed their emission allowances will have to purchase a significant,
and steadily increasing, share of emission allowances in auctions, which may result in substantial additional
cost for such companies.

An exemption from the general auctioning mechanism is available for certain energy-intensive industries
which are exposed to a significant risk of relocation of plants to countries with less stringent climate
protection laws (a phenomenon known as ‘‘Carbon Leakage’’). Since 2010, the European Commission will
determine every five years which industries are threatened by Carbon Leakage. The designated industries
will be allocated emission allowances free of charge for the period determined amounting to 100%. Since
the paper industry has been granted the relevant status, our two mills receive CO2 emission certificates free
of charge. On February 15, 2019, the European Commission adopted the Carbon Leakage List for the
years 2021-2030. According to this list, the paper industry will continue to be considered threatened by
Carbon Leakage for this upcoming period. A part of the Carbon Leakage industry sectors are allowed to
apply for financial compensation for the increase of electricity costs due to EU ETS allowance costs passed
on in electricity prices, among which is the paper and paperboard industry. The compensation is not
enforceable and is granted from funds provided in the federal budget for that purpose for the relevant
year.

For the fourth trading period (2021 to 2030), the Free Allocation Rules (FAR- (EU) 2019/331) have been
adopted on December 19, 2018. Some details concerning the free allocation of certificates are still missing.
For example, there are still no rules for adjusting the level of free allocations given to installations whose
operations have increased or decreased, as assessed on the basis of a rolling average of two years, by more
than 15% compared to the level initially used to determine the free allocation for the relevant period.

The product benchmarks, which determine the amount of allowances allocated free of charge, will decline
by 0.2 to 1.6% per year, calculated from the year 2008, in order to account for expected emission
reductions due to technological progress. Nevertheless, according to an impact assessment of the
European Commission, the paper and paperboard sector can still expect an 80% free allocation. It should
be noted that the aforementioned Carbon Leakage list has not entered into force yet. After all, a final
assessment as to the consequences is not possible yet.

In February 2014, the Commission Regulation (EU) No 176/2014 entered into force postponing the
auctioning of 900 million emission allowances from 2014 to 2016 to later in the third trading period.

By Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of October 6, 2015, the European Parliament and the European Council have
established a market stability reserve for the Union greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. According to
this Decision, the quantity of 900 million allowances deducted from auctioning volumes during the period
2014-2016 will not be added to the volumes to be auctioned in 2019 and 2020 but will instead be placed in
the reserve. Also, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 stipulates that each year a number of allowances equal to 12%
of the total number of allowances in circulation, as published by the European Commission, will be
deducted from the volume of allowances to be auctioned and will be placed in the reserve over a period of
12 months beginning on September 1 of that year, unless the number of allowances to be placed in the
reserve would be less than 100 million. In any year, if the total number of allowances in circulation is less
than 400 million, 100 million allowances will be released from the reserve and added to the volume of
allowances to be auctioned. Where fewer than 100 million allowances are in the reserve, all allowances in
the reserve will be released. Considering the need to deliver a credible investment signal to reduce CO2
emissions in a cost-efficient manner and with the aim of strengthening the EU ETS, Decision
(EU) 2015/1814 was amended on March 14, 2018 by Directive (EU) 2018/410 so as to increase the
percentage rates for determining the number of allowances to be placed each year in the reserve from 12%
to 24% and the abovementioned threshold of 100 million allowances to 200 million allowances by

162


-----

December 31, 2023. Furthermore, allowances held in the reserve above the total number of allowances
auctioned during the respective previous year should no longer be valid from 2023.

**_Energy Tax Act (EnergieStG)/Electricity Tax Act (StromStG)_**

The EnergieStG contains provisions on the taxation of the consumption of energy products. These include
coal and fuel oil, which are used in the thermal power plant. Pursuant to Section 53 EnergieStG, it is
possible to apply for tax relief for energy products which are used in stationary generation installations
with a nominal capacity exceeding 2 MWe and for which the applicable tax has been duly paid. Only the
energy products that are directly involved in the energy conversion process taking place in the electricity
generation unit are deemed to be ‘‘energy products used for the purpose of energy generation’’ within the
meaning of EnergieStG. The party using energy products for the purpose of energy generation is the party
eligible to obtain relief.

The StromStG provides for the taxation of consumed electricity. The tax rate is A20.50 per MWh pursuant
to Section 3 StromStG. Anyone supplying electricity is principally deemed to be a supplier; exceptions are
laid down in sec. 1a Ordinance implementing the StromStG (Stromsteuerdurchf¨uhrungsverordnung,
‘‘StromStV’’). Pursuant to Section 4 subs. 1 sentence 1 StromStG, anyone intending to supply electricity as
a supplier requires a license granted upon application by the main customs office. The supplier is obliged
to submit a tax return for all electricity for which tax has arisen. In the context of this tax return, the
supplier itself must calculate the amount of tax to be paid and settle the amount due with the tax office.
Electricity that is removed from the grid for the purpose of generating electricity is tax-exempt if a license
for removing electricity for the purpose of generating electricity was granted prior to the removal.
Manufacturing companies within the meaning of Section 2 no. 3 StromStG may obtain tax relief pursuant
to sec. 9b StromStG in the amount of A5.13 per MWh (if the amount of the relief exceeds A250.00 per
calendar year) and an electricity tax relief of up to 90% pursuant to Section 10 StromStG (if the tax to be
paid in the calendar year exceeds A1,000.00). The party which has removed electricity for operating
purposes is the party eligible to obtain relief.

In 2016, the Federal Ministry of Finance (Bundesministerium der Finanzen, ‘‘BMF’’) published a draft
amendment of the EnergieStG and the StromStG, which foresaw certain limitations and restrictions
regarding the aforementioned tax releases, among others a prohibition to combine the tax releases with
other State aids (so-called cumulation). The draft has been heavily criticized by the BMWi and has
therefore been revised by the BMF. It no longer included the problematic provision on the prohibition of
cumulation. On January 1, 2018, the new EnergieStG and the StromStG entered into force without the
controversial alteration. As a result, the amendments to the StromStV and the EnergieStV have been
published on January 8, 2018 with retroactive effect from January 1, 2018. Key adjustments to the legal
framework include—inter alia—provisions on the scope and conditions for the granting of subsidies to
companies in difficulty (Unternehmen in Schwierigkeiten, ‘‘UIS’’), exceptions in the definition of suppliers,
the regulation for a simplified application and authorization procedure for battery storage and the
specification of the definition of ‘‘electromobility’’.

**_Energy Services Act (EDLG)_**

Pursuant to the EDLG, companies that do not constitute micro, small or medium-sized enterprises within
the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of May 6, 2003 (Official Journal L 124 of
20/05/2003, page 36) are obliged to carry out an energy audit by December 5, 2015. This obligation does
not apply to companies which, by December 5, 2015, have implemented an energy management system in
line with the requirements of DIN EN ISO 50 001 (December 2011 edition) or an environmental
management system (EnMS). The CHP has implemented an EnMS and is certified under the
Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (‘‘EMAS’’), a voluntary scheme set up by the European Union that is
designed to help companies to continuously improve their environmental performance, but the
requirements of the EDLG also apply to current members of the Group. For a description of the EMAS
certification of Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH and the EnMS we have implemented at our two paper mills as
well as EnMS we have implemented (or plan to implement) at some of our corrugated board production
sites, see also ‘‘—Sustainability Focus; Research and Development’’. The Issuer as well as certain of its
subsidiaries will still be required to carry out an energy audit under the EDLG.

163


-----

**_Electricity Grid Access Ordinance (StromNZV)_**

The StromNZV governs the conditions for the feed-in and removal of electricity. Therefore, these
requirements are also relevant and have to be taken into account with particular regard to the power
plant’s removal of electricity from the grid.

While the StromNZV (along with the EnWG) contains general legal provisions on the feed-in and removal
of electricity, specific technical requirements are described in technical standards, which are developed by
technical bodies such as the _Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik (‘‘VDE’’). In_
2018, the VDE published new technical standards (Anwendungsregeln), which contain the recognized
engineering standards for the grid access of, among others, generation units. According to a transitional
regulation introduced with the above-mentioned EnSaG, those rules are applicable for generation units
with an electric capacity of 0.8 kW and above, for which a grid access request is submitted to the grid
operator or for which an approval according to BImSchG has been granted after April 27, 2019. They also
apply if existing generation units are significantly changed. Depending on the individual case, new
extensive certification obligations have to be fulfilled. However, an exemption applies to generation units,
for which a grid access request was launched or a BImSchG approval had been issued by April 27, 2019, if
they are put into operation by June 30, 2020.

**_Environmental laws and other related laws and regulations_**

Like the operation of our two paper mills, the operation of the CHP requires active permits under the
BImSchG, it triggers the various duties and potential liability under the Federal Water Management Act
(WHG), the Federal Waste Management Act (KrWG) and the Federal Soil Protection Act (BBodSchG),
and it is subject to the rules for the protection of nature and landscape, as well as flora and fauna, that are
codified in the Federal Nature Conservation Act (Bundesnaturschutzgesetz, ‘‘BNatSchG’’) and the State
Nature Conservation Acts (Landesnaturschutzgesetz) in the Federal State of Brandenburg. For more
details, please also see ‘‘—Regulatory Environment—Environmental Laws’’ _and ‘‘—Regulatory_
_Environment—Soil Contamination’’ above._

The technological standards applicable in relation to the requirements under the BImSchG are
substantiated by technical regulations as determined in ordinances based on the BImSchG or technical
regulations, as amended from time to time. For the CHP, the 13[th] Ordinance (Ordinance on Large
Combustion Plants, Gas Turbine Plants and Internal Combustion Engines) and the 17[th] Ordinance
(Ordinance on the Incineration and Co-Incineration of Waste) to the BImSchG are of particular
importance, the latter one particularly with regard to the co-incineration of sewage sludge. The legal
framework for the utilization/disposal of sewage sludge is currently being revised with the aim of a better
recovery of phosphates, which may lead to a declining use of sewage sludge in incineration plants.

The compliance with emission limits, which are stipulated in the permit for the CHP, will be controlled
regularly and, if necessary, can be altered subsequently by the authorities. The competent authority may
withdraw the permit if the CHP does not comply with the applicable emission limits as determined in the
permit.

The BImSchG also specifies the obligations of certain installation operators to notify the competent
authorities of operational disruptions and to implement a monitoring following such disruptions.
Operators of industry emissions installations have to provide annual reports of their emissions monitoring
to the competent authorities and there are environmental inspections on a regular basis for such
installations.

The Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control (Technische Anleitung Luft—‘‘TA Luft’’), which have to
be followed by any installation falling under the BImschG (such as power plants), are under revision.
However, in May 2017 the revision of the TA Luft was postponed by the Federal Ministry for the
Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (Bundesministerium f¨ur Umwelt,
_Naturschutz, Bau und Reaktorsicherheit, ‘‘BMUB’’) for an undefined time. Once the revision will have_
proceeded, the emission limit values for fine dust will, among other potential changes, likely be tightened
and certain adaptions will also likely be implemented with regard to the Best Available Technology (Beste
_Verf¨ugbare Technik, ‘‘BVT’’) reference documents._

**LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**

From time to time, we are involved in administrative, legal and arbitration proceedings that arise in the
ordinary course of business. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are currently involved in any litigation,
administrative proceedings or arbitration relating to claims or amounts that are material to our business
and, to our knowledge, no such litigation, administrative proceeding or arbitration is pending or
threatened. The outcome of legal proceedings, however, are difficult to predict with any certainty and we
can offer no assurances in this regard.

**SHAREHOLDERS**

91.05% of the registered share capital of the Issuer are being held by JH-Holding, a holding company
controlled by our chief executive officer, J¨urgen Heindl. The remaining 8.95% of the registered share
capital of the Issuer are being held by two minority shareholders who are not involved in the management
of our business. Pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement, the two minority shareholders have the right to
jointly designate a member of our Supervisory Board. However, this right is currently suspended until
October 2022. As a result, the two minority shareholders are currently not able to influence the
composition of the Supervisory Board.

The shareholders of JH-Holding, which has a share capital of A1,000,000, are J¨urgen Heindl, who holds
52.0% of JH-Holding’s shares (including two shares in a nominal amount of A1,000, which together provide
Mr. Heindl with a qualified majority of 75% of the voting rights in the shareholders’ meeting of
JH-Holding), and his two sons, Maximilian Heindl and Vinzenz Heindl, who each hold 24.0% of
JH-Holding’s shares.

**MANAGEMENT**

**OVERVIEW**

In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz), the Issuer has a two-tier board
system consisting of an Executive Board (Vorstand) and a Supervisory Board (Aufsichtsrat). The two boards
are separate, and, subject to a limited exception, no individual may serve concurrently as a member of both
boards.

The Executive Board is responsible for managing our day-to-day business in accordance with applicable
German law and the Articles of Association (Satzung) as well as its rules of procedure (Gesch¨aftsordnung).
In addition, the Executive Board must ensure appropriate control of risk within the Issuer and its
subsidiaries in order that any developments jeopardizing the Issuer’s future as a going concern may be
identified at an early stage. The Executive Board legally represents the Issuer in dealings with third parties
and in court.

The Supervisory Board advises the Executive Board on the management of the Issuer, monitors its conduct
of business and is responsible for appointing and dismissing the members of the Executive Board for good
cause. It also represents the Issuer in transactions between a member of the Executive Board and the
Issuer. While the Executive Board is responsible for submitting regular reports on our business activities
and fundamental issues relating to corporate planning (including financial, investment and personnel
planning) to the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board has the right to request special reports at any
time from the Executive Board. The Executive Board is also obliged to duly report to the Supervisory
Board such transactions as may be of considerable importance to the Issuer’s profitability (in particular the
return on equity) or liquidity, so that the Supervisory Board may have an opportunity to express its opinion
on such transactions before they are concluded. The Supervisory Board may also request a report at any
time on matters concerning the Issuer, on the legal and commercial relationships with affiliated companies
or on commercial operations at these companies that may have a significant impact on the Issuer and its
subsidiaries.

The Supervisory Board generally may not exercise management functions. The rules of procedure of the
Executive Board, however, require that certain types of transactions may not be carried out by the
Executive Board without the prior consent of the Supervisory Board. If the Supervisory Board refuses to
approve a certain transaction or business activity contemplated by the Executive Board, the Executive
Board can request that the general shareholders’ meeting decide on the matter. However, the general
shareholders’ meeting of a German stock corporation may not issue directives to the Executive Board.

The members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board owe duties of loyalty and care vis-`a-vis the
Issuer. In discharging their duties, the members of these corporate bodies must consider a broad range of
interests, including our interests, which in turn include the interests of our shareholders, employees,
creditors and, to a certain extent, the general public. The Executive Board must also take due account of
the shareholders’ right to equal treatment and equal information. The members of the Executive Board or
of the Supervisory Board are jointly and severally liable to the Issuer for any damages that may arise if they
fail to discharge their duties.

As a basic principle under German law, a shareholder has no direct recourse against the members of the
Executive Board or the Supervisory Board in the event that they breach a duty vis-`a-vis the Issuer. Except
for certain special circumstances, only the Issuer itself has the right to bring claims for damages against
members of either board, whereby the Issuer is represented by the Executive Board when bringing claims
against the Supervisory Board and by the Supervisory Board when bringing claims against the Executive
Board. Pursuant to a ruling by the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), the Supervisory
Board is obliged to bring claims which are likely to be successful against the Executive Board unless
material considerations pertaining to the interest of the corporation outweigh or are at least equivalent to
those in favor of enforcing such claim. Despite a refusal of the Supervisory Board to pursue a claim for
damages, such a claim must be enforced (i) upon a resolution of the general shareholders’ meeting,
(ii) upon a petition with the competent court by minority shareholders meeting a certain minimum
requirement as to their stake in the Issuer, or (iii) by the Issuer’s creditors whose claims could not be
settled by the Issuer. The Issuer may only waive or settle such claims for damages if at least three years

Under German law, no individual shareholder (or any other person) may exert its influence on the Issuer
to cause a member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board to engage in any act detrimental to
the Issuer. Shareholders with a controlling interest may not use it to cause the Issuer to act against its own
interest unless the prejudice to its interests is compensated for. Any shareholder using its interest in the
Issuer to cause a member of the Executive Board, a member of the Supervisory Board or a person who
holds a power of attorney (Prokurist) or is authorized to act for the Issuer (Handlungsbevollm¨achtigter) to
engage in any act detrimental to the Issuer or to our shareholders must compensate the Issuer and the
shareholders for any loss sustained thereby. In addition, the members of the Executive Board and the
members of the Supervisory Board are jointly and severally liable if they act in breach of their obligations.

Progroup AG provides for a directors and officers liability insurance policy for all members of the
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board and for certain other managers with leadership responsibilities
within Progroup AG and its subsidiaries.

**Executive Board**

**_General Information_**

The Executive Board is responsible for managing the business of the Issuer in accordance with the German
Stock Corporation Act, the Issuer’s Articles of Association and the rules of procedure (Gesch¨aftsordnung)
for the Executive Board. The Executive Board also represents the Issuer in its dealings with third parties
and in court. According to the Articles of Association and the provisions of the German Stock Corporation
Act, the Executive Board must consist of a minimum of one member. The Supervisory Board determines
the number of members of the Executive Board and appoints such members. It may also appoint the
Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board. Members of the Executive Board are appointed
for a maximum term of five years. They may be repeatedly reappointed or their term of office may be
extended, in each instance for a period of up to five years. The Supervisory Board may revoke the
appointment of a member of the Executive Board before the end of his or her term of office for good
cause, such as gross breach of duty or in case of a vote of no confidence by the general shareholders’
meeting.

The Executive Board has overall responsibility for the Issuer’s business. In accordance with its
allocation-of-responsibilities plan (Gesch¨aftsverteilungsplan), each member of the Executive Board is
assigned an area of responsibility defined in such plan, which sets out the allocation of responsibilities.
Notwithstanding the overall responsibility held by the Executive Board, each member of the Executive
Board is responsible for the area allocated to him or her. Pursuant to the rules of procedure
(Gesch¨aftsordnung) for the Executive Board, certain management actions may only be taken, and certain
types of transactions may only be concluded, with the approval of the Supervisory Board. As a rule, the
Executive Board should meet every week. The Executive Board has a quorum if a meeting has been called
with due notice and all or, in the event that the Executive Board has more than two members, at least half
of the members which must include the Chairman are present. If not otherwise required by law, the
Executive Board decides by a simple majority of the votes cast. In the event of a tie, the Chairman has the
deciding vote. Members of the Executive Board may not deal with, or vote on, measures relating to
proposals, arrangements or contracts between him/herself and the Issuer.

Individual board members serve as representatives with primary responsibility for the Issuer’s various
corporate functions and for the fields of business in which the Issuer operates. Despite this internal
allocation of responsibilities, each member of the Executive Board has overall responsibility
(Gesamtverantwortung) for the Issuer as a whole.

The Issuer’s Articles of Association provide that the Issuer can be legally represented by two members of
the Executive Board or by one member of the Executive Board in conjunction with an authorized signatory
who holds a power of attorney (Prokurist). The Supervisory Board has granted the Chairman, Mr. J¨urgen
Heindl, authorization to solely represent the Issuer in accordance with the Articles of Association.

The Supervisory Board may appoint deputy members of the Executive Board who, in accordance with the
German Stock Corporation Act, have the same rights and responsibilities as the regular members of the
Executive Board.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

_The following summary of certain provisions of the documents listed below governing certain of our_
_indebtedness does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the_
_underlying documents. Unless otherwise defined in this offering memorandum or unless the context otherwise_
_requires, terms defined in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Facilities, the_
_New Senior Secured Facilities and the Intercreditor Agreement shall have the same meanings when used in this_
_section._

**OVERVIEW**

On April 23, 2015, the Issuer and the Guarantors (other than Progroup Power 1 GmbH and Progroup
Paper PM3 GmbH) entered into the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility which provides for up to
A50.0 million of committed credit that may be drawn by certain members of the Group specified therein
from time to time. The obligations of the borrowers under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (and
certain Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities) are guaranteed on a senior basis by the
Issuer and the Guarantors and are secured by the same Collateral that secures the Existing Notes and the
Existing Senior Secured Facilities (as defined below) and that will secure all obligations under the New
Senior Secured Facilities (as defined below) and, upon issuance of the Additional Notes, the Additional
Notes, on a super priority basis pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. On December 21,
2017, among other things, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into an amendment and restatement
agreement relating to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. Among other amendments, the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility was amended to include an uncommitted ‘‘accordion feature’’ which will
give us the option to increase the total commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
from currently A50,000,000 to up to A80,000,000.

On December 1, 2015, Progroup Board sp. z o.o., as borrower, the Issuer and the then-existing Guarantors,
as guarantors, entered into the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility which provided for PLN 107 million of
committed credit. In addition, on May 31, 2016, Progroup Board sp. z o.o., as borrower, the Issuer and the
Guarantors, as guarantors, entered into the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility to fund the establishment of
our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland. As of March 31, 2019, PLN 58.9 million
(carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A13.7 million, calculated based on an exchange rate of
A1.00 = PLN 4.3006, which was the exchange rate of the zloty against the euro reported by the National
Bank of Poland on March 31, 2019) in borrowings under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained
outstanding, and PLN 76.0 million (carrying amount at March 31, 2019: A17.7 million, calculated based on
an exchange rate of A1.00 = PLN 4.3006) in borrowings under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility
remained outstanding. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the same amounts of borrowings
remain outstanding under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility and under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN
Facility.

On December 21, 2017, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into the Existing Senior Secured IKB
Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility. The Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities
originally provided for a A8.5 million Facility A and a A30.0 million Facility B, both refinanced by KfW,
which we have fully utilized. However, as of December 31, 2018, the amount repayable under Facility A
was reduced to A7.155 million as a result of a A1.345 million repayment grant. The GBP70.0 million
Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility was also fully utilized as of the date of this offering memorandum.

On July 13, 2018, to fund a portion of the expected investment into the establishment of our new paper
mill (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, the Issuer and the Guarantors entered into (i) an
amendment and restatement of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, adding an additional
A25.0 million Facility C, refinanced by KfW, which may be utilized by Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH until
August 10, 2019, (ii) the A25.0 million Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, refinanced by KfW, which
may be utilized by Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH until August 10, 2019 and (iii) the A75.0 million Existing
Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, which consist of a A45.0 million Facility A, refinanced by KfW,
which may be utilized by Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH until August 10, 2019, and two separate
A15.0 million facilities (Facility B and Facility C), financed by Commerzbank itself, which are fully utilized
as of the date of this offering memorandum. The A25.0 million Facility C under the Existing Senior Secured
IKB Facility, the A25.0 million Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the A45.0 million Facility A
under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities remain undrawn as of the date of this offering
memorandum, but we expect to fully draw all such facilities by August 10, 2019. On August 6, 2018, to
further secure the overall funding of our investment into our proposed new paper mill (PM3), the Issuer

174


-----

and the Guarantors further entered into the A30.0 million Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility, which
may be utilized by Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH until one month before December 31, 2023. The Existing
Senior Secured HSBC Facility remains undrawn as of the date of this offering memorandum. We refer to
the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, the Existing Senior
Secured GBP Facility, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, the Existing Senior Secured
Commerzbank Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility collectively as ‘‘Existing Senior
**Secured Facilities’’.**

On May 31, 2019, the Issuer and the Guarantors finally entered into the A30.0 million New Senior Secured
Erste Bank Facility, the A30.0 million New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and the A15.0 million New
Senior Secured SaarLB Facility (together the ‘‘New Senior Secured Facilities’’, and the New Senior
Secured Facilities together with the Existing Senior Secured Facilities, the ‘‘Senior Secured Facilities’’),
primarily to fund the approximately A70-75 million of expected total investment into our proposed new
corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW14). The utilization of the New Senior Secured Facilities is subject to
certain conditions precedent. We expect to satisfy all remaining conditions precedent on or around the
issue date of the Additional Notes. As a result, the New Senior Secured Facilities will remain undrawn on
the issue date of the Additional Notes. We may utilize the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility, the
New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and the new Senior Secured SaarLB Facility until June, 2021, May,
2020 and May, 2020, respectively.

All our Senior Secured Facilities are being guaranteed irrevocably and unconditionally, subject to certain
customary limitations and agreed security principles, on a joint and several basis, by the Issuer and the
Guarantors. The lenders under each Existing Senior Secured Facility have acceded, and the lenders under
the New Senior Secured Facilities will accede, to the Intercreditor Agreement. Any amounts outstanding
under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities are, and any amounts outstanding under the New Senior
Secured Facilities will be, secured by the same Collateral that secures (or will secure, as applicable) the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, each other Senior Secured Facility, the Existing Notes and, upon
issuance of the Additional Notes, the Additional Notes.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Facilities each contain customary
information and general loan style covenants and will also include restrictive covenants that closely track
those contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Facilities each contain customary
events of default (subject in certain cases to agreed grace periods, thresholds and other qualifications)
including, a cross default (including with respect to an event of default under, and as defined in, the
Conditions of Issue), non-payment, misrepresentation, insolvency and insolvency proceedings,
unlawfulness, litigation and material adverse change the occurrence of which would allow the agent under
each Senior Secured Facility (who shall do so if directed by the required majority of the lenders) to
accelerate all or part of the loan outstanding and/or terminate any available commitments and/or exercise
any of its rights and remedies under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility or relevant Senior Secured
Facility, as applicable, and other related finance documents.

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Facilities and any non-contractual
obligations arising out of or in connection with them are governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with German law.

**SUPER SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY**

On April 23, 2015, we entered into the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility provides for A50.0 million of committed financing (the ‘‘Total Commitments’’), which is
available for utilization by way of the drawing of cash revolving loans, and by way of ancillary facilities,
until the date falling one month prior to the Final SSRCF Maturity Date (as defined below). On
December 1, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility to re-set
the previous consolidated net leverage ratio test, upon the CHP Acquisition being completed. On
December 21, 2017, we further entered into an amendment and restatement agreement relating to the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘SSRCF Amendment and Restatement Agreement’’), among
other things, to affect significant improved terms, give us greater flexibility and affect the accession of
Goldman Sachs International Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities plc as new, additional lenders under the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility. This description describes the terms of the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility as amended and restated by the SSRCF Amendment and Restatement Agreement.

175


-----

The original borrowers under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility are the Issuer, Progroup Board
s.r.o., Progroup Board sp. z o.o., and Progroup Board Ltd. The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is
being guaranteed by the Guarantors (as defined below under ‘‘Security and Guarantees’’) and the Issuer.
The facility agent (the ‘‘Agent’’) under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is Deutsche Bank
Luxembourg S.A.

**_Increase Option_**

The Issuer may, on one or more occasions and subject to certain conditions set out in the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, by delivering to the Agent a duly completed increase request no later than thirty
(30) business days nor earlier than sixty (60) business days before the date on which such increase is to take
effect, request an increase of the total commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility in an
amount that is A10 million or, if more, an integral multiple of A1 million, provided that the aggregate
amount of any such increases of the total commitments must not exceed A30 million. This provision will
give us the option to increase the total commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
from currently A50 million to up to A80 million. Each lender under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility will have the right, at its sole discretion, to agree or reject (in whole or in part) an increase request.
If, following an allocation process set for the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the amount of the
increased commitments of the existing lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is less than
requested by the Issuer, the Issuer may (through the Agent) then request any existing lender under the
Senior Revolving Credit Facility which is willing to do so (or another bank or financial institution which is
not an existing lender and which is willing to do so) to (additionally) further increase its commitment by
such amount notified to it, or part thereof, (or, as the case may be, accede to the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility as a lender with such new commitment), subject to certain conditions set forth in the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Ancillary Facilities_**

A lender (or any of its affiliates) may make available to a borrower under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility all or part of that lender’s undrawn commitment in the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility by way of ancillary facilities such as overdraft facilities, guarantees, bonding, documentary or
stand-by letter of credit facilities, short-term loan facilities, foreign exchange facilities or any other facility
or accommodation required in connection with the business of the Group and which is agreed between the
Issuer and the relevant lender (or its affiliate), other than derivative or other transactions where the
potential loss may be greater than the relevant Ancillary Lender’s commitments under the Ancillary
Facility plus customary interest and fees, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will terminate on March 27, 2024 (the ‘‘Final SSRCF Maturity
**Date’’) and any amounts still outstanding at such date will be immediately due and payable.**

Subject to certain conditions, we may voluntarily prepay our utilizations and/or permanently cancel all or
part of the available commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility by giving three
business days’ prior notice to the Agent (provided that such prepayment or cancellation must be, if in part,
in a minimum amount of A1 million) or the remainder if the outstanding loan or the remaining
commitments are less than A1 million.

Amounts prepaid or repaid may (subject to the terms of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility) be
re-borrowed.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

   - with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations
under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility; and

  - under the circumstances described under the second bullet under ‘‘—Purchase Condition’’ below.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the Agent describing the transaction or transactions that constituted the Change of Control and offer to
repay each lender’s participation under the loans on the date specified in such notice (the ‘‘Change of
**Control Offer’’) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such**

176


-----

notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Repayment Date’’), but no later than the respective change of
control offer for any of the Senior Secured Debt (as defined below). Pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer, each lender will have the right to require the original borrowers to repay such lender’s participation
in any loans together with accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts accrued under the
finance documents in respect of any such participation in any such loans on the Change of Control
Repayment Date, whereupon the commitment of that lender will be cancelled.

‘‘Change of Control’’ means the occurrence of the following:

(i) for as long as no Public Market exists for the Capital Stock of the Issuer (or a Holding Company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert in the
meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover
Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a Permitted Holder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% of the issued and outstanding
Voting Stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a Public Market exists for the Capital Stock of the Issuer (or a Holding
Company), the Issuer becoming aware of (i) any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert
in the meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and
Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Ubernahmegesetz[¨] ) other than a Permitted Holder acquiring
and holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% of the issued and outstanding
Voting Stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares and
(ii) Permitted Holders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued and
outstanding Voting Stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares
than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or
consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole to a Person other than a Permitted Holder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or
substantially all of assets of the Issuer.

‘‘Senior Secured Debt’’ means the aggregate principal amount outstanding, from time to time, under the
Notes, any borrowings under the Senior Secured Facilities and any other liabilities of the Issuer or the
Guarantors in respect of any loan, credit or guarantee facility, notes, indenture or security that rank
equally in right of payment with the liabilities under the Notes and the Senior Secured Facilities, as
applicable, and which are permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility and are permitted under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement to share (and do share) in the
Collateral on an equal and ratable basis as the creditors in relation to the Notes and Senior Secured
Facilities.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR,
LIBOR, WIBOR, PRIBOR or BUBOR, as applicable, plus a margin of 2.00% per annum.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears at the end of each calendar quarter during the
availability period, on available but unused commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
at a rate of 35% of the applicable margin under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

We are also required to pay fees related to the issuance of ancillary facilities and certain fees to the
arrangers, the Agent and the Security Agent in connection with the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility is being guaranteed irrevocably and unconditionally, subject to
certain customary limitations and agreed security principles, on a joint and several basis, by the Issuer,
Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup Logistics GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper
PM2 GmbH, Progroup Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Board s.r.o., Progroup Board sp. z o.o. and Progroup
Board Ltd. (the ‘‘Guarantors’’).

177


-----

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility also provides that (subject to certain customary limitations and
agreed security principles):

  - as at December 31 of each year (the ‘‘Accounting Reference Date’’), the aggregate EBITDA of the
Issuer and the Guarantors (calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in
the Conditions of Issue), eliminating the effects of all intra-Group transactions and provided that
the EBITDA of any entity that is negative shall be deemed to be zero, must represent at least 80%
of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group (with the EBITDA of any entity that is negative deemed
to be zero) determined annually on the basis of the relevant financial statements of the members of
the Group (the ‘‘Guarantor Coverage Test’’); provided that no breach of the Guarantor Coverage
Test shall occur if within 120 days of the delivery of the audited consolidated financial statements of
the Issuer for the financial year ended on the relevant Accounting Reference Date to the Agent the
Issuer procures, subject to agreed security principles, that additional Restricted Subsidiaries
become Guarantors such that if they had been Guarantors on the relevant Accounting Reference
Date, the Guarantor Coverage Test would have been satisfied.; and

  - (i) any wholly-owned member of the Group that holds shares in an obligor (other than the Issuer)
and (ii) a member of the Group (other than the Issuer) that has EBITDA (calculated on same basis
as Consolidated EBITDA representing 10% or more of Consolidated EBITDA or has total assets
or sales representing 10% or more of the total assets or sales of the Group (in each case, after
elimination of any effects of any intra-Group transactions) must become a guarantor under the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and grant security as the Agent may require (subject to
customary limitations and agreed security principles), within 120 days.

**_Covenants_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility contains customary information and general loan style
covenants as well as restrictive covenants that closely track those contained in the Conditions of Issue of
the Notes. The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility also requires the Issuer to monitor each member of
the Group’s financial and operating performance and to ensure that the Issuer is in compliance with the
Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined below) in respect of any period of twelve months ending on a
quarter-end date (a ‘‘Testing Period’’) during any time during which the aggregate base currency amount of
all utilizations (in certain circumstances taking into account proposed utilizations) and cash ancillary
outstandings under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be equal to or greater than 40 per cent.
of the total commitments thereunder (a ‘‘Trigger Period’’).

‘‘Interest Coverage Ratio’’ in respect of any Testing Period, means the ratio of (i) the aggregate amount of
Consolidated EBITDA for such Testing Period to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Consolidated Net
Interest Expenses of the Group for such Testing Period.

‘‘Consolidated Net Interest Expenses’’ in respect of any Testing Period means the consolidated interest
expenses (Zinsaufwand) of the Group for such Testing Period, excluding the consolidated interest-like
expenses (zins¨ahnlicher Aufwand) of the Group for such Testing Period, after deducting the consolidated
interest income (Zinsertrag) of the Group for such Testing Period.

The financial covenant relating to the ‘‘Interest Coverage Ratio’’ will be tested on quarterly test dates as
long as a Trigger Period is continuing.

**_Interest Cover_**

While a Trigger Period has occurred and is continuing, the Interest Coverage Ratio shall not be less than
3.50:1, provided that, for a maximum of four times during the life of the facilities under the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, a breach of Interest Coverage Ratio covenant shall only constitute a default
under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility if it is not complied with in respect of two successive
Testing Periods.

178


-----

**_Purchase Condition_**

The Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility only allows members of the Group to repay, purchase, defease
or redeem (or otherwise retire for value) or acquire any Senior Secured Debt (as described under
‘‘—Repayments and Prepayments’’ above) prior to its stated maturity (or offer to do so) if either:

  - such purchase being funded, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of any Refinancing
Indebtedness (as defined in the Conditions of Issue) or the proceeds of a sale of Capital Stock (as
defined in the Conditions of Issue) of the Issuer, Subordinated Shareholder Debt (as defined in the
Conditions of Issue) or a contribution to the equity of the Issuer (other than by a subsidiary of the
Issuer) in accordance with the restrictive covenants under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility (which closely track those that will be contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes;

  - at the same time as the relevant purchase, the Issuer permanently cancels the total commitments
and, if applicable, permanently prepays any utilizations in the same proportion as the amount of the
purchase bears to the aggregate principal amount of our senior secured debt outstanding on
March 27, 2018, provided that the Issuer shall only be required to cancel any commitments and
prepay any utilizations in connection with any purchase until the total commitments (as so reduced)
are equal to 40 percent of the total commitments under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility
(after taking into account any prior increases as described under ‘‘—Increase Option’’ above;

  - the Interest Coverage Ratio for the last Testing Period ending immediately prior to the date on
which such purchase is contractually committed is equal to or higher than 3.50:1 after giving _pro_
_forma effect to the relevant purchase and any Indebtedness incurred to fund such purchase;_

  - such purchase is made following the occurrence of a Change of Control and the Issuer has fully
complied with its obligations in relation to such Change of Control as set out under ‘‘—Repayments
_and Prepayments’’ above prior to any such purchase; or_

  - following the completion of the purchase, Senior Secured Debt (as described under ‘‘—Repayments
_and Prepayments’’ above) with an aggregate principal amount equal to 50% or more of the_
aggregate principal amount of our senior secured debt outstanding on March 27, 2018 will remain
outstanding,

unless, in each case, a default is continuing or would result from the purchase.

**EXISTING SENIOR SECURED PLN FACILITIES**

On December 1, 2015, Progroup Board sp. z o.o., as borrower, the Issuer and the then-existing Guarantors,
as guarantors, entered into a PLN-denominated senior secured facility agreement (the ‘‘2015 Senior
**Secured PLN Facility’’) with Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as facility agent, arranger and original**
lender. The 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility provided for PLN 107 million of committed credit that
Progroup Board sp. z o.o. could draw as an amortizing term loan until March 31, 2016 (the ‘‘2015 Senior
**Secured PLN Facility Availability Period’’). As of the date of this offering memorandum, PLN 58.9 million in**
borrowings under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding. The borrowings under the
2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility were used for the partial repayment of a then-existing intra-group loan
between Progroup Board GmbH as lender and Progroup Board sp. z o.o. and the payment of related
transaction costs.

In addition, on May 31, 2016, Progroup Board sp. z o.o., as borrower, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as
guarantors, entered into another PLN-denominated senior secured facility agreement (the ‘‘2016 Senior
**Secured PLN Facility’’ and together with the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility, the ‘‘Existing** **Senior**
**Secured PLN Facilities’’) with Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as facility agent, arranger and original**
lender to fund the establishment of our corrugated board production site (PW10) in Trzcinica, Poland. The
2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility also provides for PLN 107 million of committed credit that Progroup
Board sp. z o.o. is required to fully draw as an amortizing term loan until May 31, 2017 (the ‘‘2016 Senior
**Secured PLN Facility Availability Period’’). As of the date of this offering memorandum, PLN 76.0 million in**
borrowings under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility remained outstanding.

On December 21, 2017, we entered into separate amendment and restatement agreements relating to the
Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities (each a ‘‘2017 PLN Facility Amendment and Restatement
**Agreement’’). We subsequently cancelled and replaced the 2017 PLN Facility Amendment and**
Restatement Agreements by certain separate new amendment and restatement agreements, each dated
March 26, 2018 (the ‘‘2018 PLN Facility Amendment and Restatement Agreements’’) to align the

179


-----

restrictive covenants in the covenant schedule of each Existing Senior Secured PLN Facility with the
relevant restrictive covenants contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes. In addition, the 2018 PLN
Facility Amendment and Restatement Agreements provided for a cashless conversion and re-borrowing
under each Existing Senior Secured PLN Facility. The following descriptions of certain provisions of the
Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities summarize the relevant provisions of the existing Senior Secured
PLN Facilities as amended and restated by the 2018 PLN Facility Amendment and Restatement
Agreements, as so further amended.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility has a six year term and the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility has a
five year team, each with a final maturity date of December 31, 2021 (the ‘‘Final PLN Facility Maturity
**Date’’).**

Following an initial year of no repayments, Progroup Board sp. z. o.o. is required to repay the PLN
107 million in original borrowings under the 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility in 20 equal, quarterly
installments, commencing on March 31, 2017 and ending on the Final PLN Facility Maturity Date.

Progroup Board sp. z. o.o. is required to repay the PLN 107 million in original borrowings under the 2016
Senior Secured PLN Facility by repaying on each repayment date an amount which reduces the amount of
the aggregate borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Senior Secured PLN Facility by an amount as set out
in the following table:

Progroup Board sp. z o.o. may voluntarily prepay the whole or part of the loan outstanding under the
relevant Existing Senior Secured PLN Facility by giving five business days’ prior notice to the agent (but if
in part, being an amount that reduces the amount of the loan by a minimum of PLN 5 million or the
remainder if the outstanding loan is less than PLN 5 million).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, each Existing Senior Secured PLN Facility requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for
such lender to perform any of its obligations under the relevant Existing Senior Secured PLN Facility.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the agent under each Existing Senior Secured PLN Facility describing the transaction or transactions
that constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation under the Existing
Senior Secured PLN Facilities in the loans and to cancel each lender’s commitment on the date specified in
such notice (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than
60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Repayment Date’’) but no later than
the respective change of control offer for any of the other senior secured debt. Pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer, each lender under the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities will have the right to require
Progroup Board sp. z o.o. to prepay all or any part of the principal amount of such lender’s participation in
the loans at a prepayment price in cash equal to (i) if the Change of Control occurs on or prior to
December 31, 2020, 104.35% of the aggregate principal amount of such lender’s participation in the loans;
or (ii) if the Change of Control occurs after December 31, 2020, the aggregate principal amount of such
lender’s participation in the loans plus an indemnity for early repayment (Vorf¨alligkeitsentsch¨adigung)
determined by each lender in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, plus, in each case, accrued
and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts accrued under the finance documents, if any to but
excluding the Change of Control Repayment Date, whereupon the commitment of that lender will be
cancelled.

180


-----

‘‘Change of Control’’, for purposes of the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, means the occurrence of
the following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning
given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a permitted shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of (i) any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert in the
meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover
Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und Ubernahmegesetz[¨] ) other than a permitted shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares and (ii) permitted
shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued and outstanding
voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares than such
other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or
consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder;

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer; or

(v) the Issuer ceases to hold (directly or indirectly) 100% of the shares in Progroup Board sp. z o.o.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The 2015 Senior Secured PLN Facility bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.27% per annum, and the 2016
Senior Secured PLN Facility bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.90% per annum.

Progroup Board sp. z o.o. was also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears at the end of each calendar
quarter at a rate of 0.75% per annum with regard to any available but unused commitments under the 2016
Senior Secured PLN Facility during the period starting on July 11, 2016 until the last day of the 2016
Senior Secured PLN Facility Availability Period.

Progroup Board sp. z o.o. also paid upfront fees of A25,000 to Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, as
arranger in connection with each Senior Secured PLN Facility.

**EXISTING SENIOR SECURED IKB FACILITIES**

On December 21, 2017, the Issuer, as company and borrower, Progroup Board GmbH and the other
Guarantors as guarantors, entered into a euro-denominated senior secured facility agreement (the
‘‘Existing Senior Secured EUR Facility’’) with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG as agent and original lender.
The Senior Secured EUR Facility originally provided for A38,500,000 of total committed credit, including
(i) a A8.5 million term loan facility (‘‘Facility A’’) and (ii) a A30.0 million term loan facility (‘‘Facility B’’).
Both Facility A and Facility B are refinanced by funds made available by Kreditanstalt f¨ur Wiederaufbau
(‘‘KfW’’), the German government-owned development bank, under certain KfW programs that offer
subsidized funding for eligible investments that promote energy efficiency. We have fully utilized both
Facility A and Facility B. However, as of December 31, 2018, the amount repayable under Facility A was
reduced to A7.155 million as a result of a A1.345 million repayment grant. On July 13, 2018, to fund a
portion of the expected investment into the establishment of our new paper mill (PM3) in SandersdorfBrehna, Germany, the Issuer, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH and the other Guarantors entered into an
amendment and restatement of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, adding an additional
A25.0 million term loan facility (‘‘Facility C’’), also refinanced by KfW, which may be utilized by Progroup
Paper PM3 GmbH until August 10, 2019.

The dedicated purposes of the borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities are (i) to fund
the installation of a waste heat system for our paper machine (PM1) in Burg, Germany, in the case of the
Facility A, (ii) to fund certain eligible investments in connection with the establishment of our new

181


-----

corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom, in the case of the Facility B
and (iii) to fund certain eligible investments in connection with the proposed establishment of our new
paper mill (PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany, in the case of the Facility C.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Facility A has a final maturity date of September 30, 2027, the Facility B has a final maturity date of
December 30, 2027 and the Facility C has a final maturity date of 30 June 2028.

Subject to application of the repayment grant (Tilgungszuschuss) of A1,344,600 we were awarded as
described below, we will be required to repay our borrowings under the Facility A in instalments by
repaying on each Facility A repayment date an amount which reduces the amount of the outstanding
borrowings under the Facility A by an amount as set out in the following table:

If the Facility A, the Facility B and/or the Facility C is not utilized in full at the end of the relevant
availability period the relevant repayment instalments will, subject to the consent of KfW, be reduced pro
_rata. Should KfW withhold such consent, any unutilized amounts will be deducted from the relevant_
repayment instalments of the relevant facility in inverse chronological order, i.e. beginning with the
repayment instalment for the last repayment date. In this case, the final maturity date of the relevant
facility will be deemed to be the last repayment date on which a repayment instalment (or any part of it)
remains to be made.

Under the terms of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, we may apply for a repayment grant
(Tilgungszuschuss) of up to A1,344,600 with regard to Facility A and of up to A3.95 million with regard to
Facility C, in each case funded from resources of the German Ministry of Economics and Technology
(BMWi) on the repayment of all amounts borrowed under the relevant facility (each a ‘‘KfW Repayment
**Grant’’). The amounts of each KfW Repayment Grant, if granted, are to be offset against the repayment**
instalments with regard to the relevant facility falling due after the date on which the KfW Repayment
Grant is granted. According to the conditions applicable to the KfW Repayment Grant, we may only
become entitled to the KfW Repayment Grant if, among other things: (i) KfW has received (via the
Agent), in form and substance satisfactory to it, a use of funds certificate together with the relevant
application promptly after the investment funded by the relevant facility has been made, subject to certain
deadlines. If and to the extent the KfW Repayment Grant is awarded, the amounts granted thereunder are
offset against the repayment instalments with regard to the relevant facility in inverse chronological order,
i.e. beginning with the repayment instalment for the last repayment date with regard to the relevant
facility. As of December 31, 2018, we were awarded the maximum KfW Repayment Grant of A1,344,600
with regard to the Facility A.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loan
outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities by giving ten business days’ prior notice to
the agent (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the amount of such loan by a minimum amount of
A5 million or the remainder).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities require mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such
lender to perform any of its obligations under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the agent under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities describing the transaction or transactions
that constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation in any loans under
the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities in the loans on the date specified in such notice (the ‘‘Change of
**Control Offer’’) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such**

183


-----

notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Repayment Date’’) but no later than the respective Change of
Control Offer for any of the other senior secured debt. Pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, each
lender under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities will have the right to require us to prepay all or
any part of the principal amount of such lender’s participation in the loans plus break costs determined by
each lender in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an amount requested from
such lender by KfW, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts accrued
under the finance documents.

‘‘Change of Control’’, for purposes of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, means the occurrence of
the following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning
given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding
company), the Issuer becoming aware of (i) any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert
in the meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and
Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a permitted shareholder
acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% issued and
outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares
and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued
and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of
shares than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or
consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer;

(v) or in case of Facility C the Issuer ceases to hold (directly or indirectly) 100% of the shares in
Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility A and the Facility B bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.45% per annum, and
any borrowings under the Facility C will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per annum.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 30 at a rate of 0.25% per month with regard to any available but unused commitments in
relation to the Facility C during the period starting on the date falling one day after August 8, 2019, until
the last day of the relevant availability period.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that
closely track those contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured IKB
Facilities require us to submit to KfW, via the agent under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities,
certain use of funds certificates (Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that we have made use of the
funds borrowed under the Facility A, the Facility B and the Facility C, as applicable, in accordance with the
specified purpose described above and relevant KfW program rules. Furthermore, we are required to
procure that the investment measures implemented with the borrowings under the Facility A and Facility C
are operated in accordance with their designated purpose for a period of at least five (5) years (the
‘‘Minimum Operating Period’’), and during the Minimum Operating Period, no part of the relevant
investments may, subject to the principle of proportionality, be abandoned or sold-off (unless the further
operation in accordance with the designated purpose is safeguarded).

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities, our relationship with the
lenders under the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities is also governed by the general terms and
conditions of KfW, which are incorporated into the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities by reference. In
case of any conflict between the provisions of the Existing Senior Secured IKB Facilities and the general
terms and conditions of KfW, the provisions of the general terms and conditions of KfW will prevail. In
particular, in addition to the customary events of the default contained in the Existing Senior Secured IKB
Facilities as described under ‘‘Overview’’ above, the general terms and conditions of KfW also contain
certain bespoke termination rights related to the quasi-governmental nature of the subsidized funding
provided by KfW, through IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, under the Existing Senior Secured IKB
Facilities.

**EXISTING SENIOR SECURED GBP FACILITY**

On December 21, 2017, the Issuer, as company and guarantor, Progroup Board Ltd. as borrower and
guarantor, and the other Guarantors, as guarantors, entered into a GBP-denominated senior secured
facility agreement (the ‘‘Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility’’) with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as
original lender, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, as agent. The Senior Secured GBP Facility
provides for a GBP70,000,000 non-amortizing term loan, which Progroup Board Ltd. had fully drawn as of
the date of this offering memorandum.

The Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility permits the borrowings under it to be used for (i) the partial
refinancing of the former PIK toggle notes of our parent JH-Holding and our former senior secured fixed
rate notes due 2022; (ii) any minority shareholder payments required in connection with the foregoing;
(iii) refinancing investments or costs in connection with the establishment and/or start-up of our proposed
corrugated board ‘‘mega plant’’ (PW12) in Ellesmere Port, United Kingdom; (iv) any transaction costs
related to any of the foregoing; and (v) towards the repayment of certain intra-group loans granted by the
Issuer which shall use such proceeds for the purpose of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv).

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility has a final maturity date of June 30, 2025, at which date
Progroup Board Ltd. will be required to repay the aggregate loans under the Senior Secured GBP Facility
in full.

Progroup Board Ltd. may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of the loan made available to it under
the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility by giving five business days’ notice (or such shorter period as the
majority lenders may agree) to the agent (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the amount of the
loan by a minimum of GBP1 million or the remainder if the outstanding loan is less than GBP1 million).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for
such lender to perform any of its obligations under the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the agent under the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility describing the transaction or transactions that
constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation in any loans under the
Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility in the loans and to cancel each lender’s commitment on the date
specified in such notice (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no
later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Repayment Date’’) but no
later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other senior secured debt. Pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, each lender under the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility will have the right to
require Progroup Board Ltd. to prepay such lender’s participation in the loans together with accrued and
unpaid interest and any additional amounts accrued under the finance documents in respect of any such
participation in any such loans on the Change of Control Prepayment Date, whereupon the commitment of
that lender will be cancelled.

‘‘Change of Control’’, for purposes of the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, means the occurrence of the
following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning

(Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding
company), the Issuer becoming aware of (i) any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert
in the meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and
Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a permitted shareholder
acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% issued and
outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares
and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued

shares than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or
consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder;

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or

**EXISTING SENIOR SECURED SAARLB FACILITY**

On July 13, 2018, the Issuer, as company and guarantor, Progroup Paper PM 3 GmbH as borrower, and the
other Guarantors as guarantors, entered into a euro-denominated senior secured facility agreement (the
‘‘Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility’’) with Landesbank Saar as agent and original lender. The Senior
Secured SaarLB Facility provides for A25,000,000 of total committed credit (the ‘‘Facility’’). The Facility is
refinanced by funds made available by KfW under a certain KfW program that offers subsidized funding
for eligible investments that promote energy efficiency. Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH may utilize the
Facility until August 10, 2019.

The purpose of the borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility is to partially fund
certain eligible investments in connection with the proposed establishment of our new paper mill (PM3) in

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Facility has a final maturity date of September 30, 2028.

If the Facility is not utilized in full at the end of the availability period the relevant repayment instalments
will be reduced pro rata, subject to the consent of KfW. Should KfW withhold such consent, any unutilized
amounts will be deducted from the repayment instalments in inverse chronological order, i.e. beginning
with the repayment instalment for the last repayment date. In this case, the final maturity date will be
deemed to be the last repayment date on which a repayment instalment (or any part of it) remains to be
made.

Under the terms of the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, we may apply for a repayment grant
(Tilgungszuschuss) of up to A3,944,999.11 funded from resources of the German Ministry of Economics and
Technology (BMWi) on the repayment of all amounts borrowed under the Facility (the ‘‘KfW Repayment
**Grant’’). The amount of the KfW Repayment Grant, if granted, is to be offset against the repayment**
instalments falling due after the date on which the KfW Repayment Grant is granted. According to the
conditions applicable to the KfW Repayment Grant, we may only become entitled to the KfW Repayment
Grant if, among other things: (i) KfW has received (via the Agent), in form and substance satisfactory to it,
a use of funds certificate together with the relevant application promptly after the investment funded by
the Facility has been made, subject to certain deadlines. If and to the extent the KfW Repayment Grant is
awarded, the amounts granted thereunder are offset against the repayment instalments with regard to the
Facility in inverse chronological order, i.e. beginning with the repayment instalment for the last repayment
date with regard to the Facility.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loan
outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility by giving ten business days’ prior notice to
the agent (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the amount of such loan by a minimum amount of
A3 million or the remainder). In case of a prepayment must be made prior to the next Interest Payment no
break costs must be paid.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such
lender to perform any of its obligations under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the agent under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility describing the transaction or transactions
that constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation in any loans and to
cancel each Lender’s Commitment under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility in the loans on the
date specified in such notice (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days
and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Repayment Date’’)
but no later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other senior secured debt. Pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer, each lender under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility will have

187


-----

the right to require us to prepay all or any part of the principal amount of such lender’s participation in the
loans plus break costs determined by each lender in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at
least in an amount requested from such lender by KfW, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and
any additional amounts accrued under the finance documents whereupon the Commitment of that Lender
will be cancelled.

‘‘Change of Control’’, for purposes of the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, means the occurrence of
the following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning
given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding
company), the Issuer becoming aware of (i) any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert
in the meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and
Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a permitted shareholder
acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% issued and
outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares
and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued
and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of
shares than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or
consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer; or

(v) the Issuer ceases to hold (directly or indirectly) 100% of the shares in Progroup Paper
PM3 GmbH.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.20% per annum.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 30 at a rate of 0.25% per month with regard to any available but unused commitments in
relation to the Facility during the period starting on the date falling one day after August 10, 2019, until the
last day of the relevant availability period.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that
closely track those contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB
Facility requires us to submit to KfW, via the agent under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility,
certain use of funds certificates (Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that we have made use of the
funds borrowed under the Facility, as applicable, in accordance with the specified purpose described above
and relevant KfW program rules. Furthermore, we are required to procure that the investment measures
implemented with the borrowings under the Facility are operated in accordance with their designated
purpose for a period of at least five (5) years (the ‘‘Minimum Operating Period’’), and during the
Minimum Operating Period, no part of the relevant investments may, subject to the principle of
proportionality, be abandoned or sold-off (unless the further operation in accordance with the designated
purpose is safeguarded).

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, our relationship with the
lenders under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility is also governed by the general terms and

188


-----

conditions of KfW, which are incorporated into the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility by reference.
In case of any conflict between the provisions of the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the
general terms and conditions of KfW, the provisions of the general terms and conditions of KfW will
prevail. In particular, in addition to the customary events of the default contained in the Existing Senior
Secured SaarLB Facility as described under ‘‘Overview’’ above, the general terms and conditions of KfW
also contain certain bespoke termination rights related to the quasi-governmental nature of the subsidized
funding provided by KfW, through Landesbank Saar, under the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility.

**EXISTING SENIOR SECURED COMMERZBANK FACILITIES**

On July 13, 2018, the Issuer, as company and guarantor, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH as borrower and
guarantor, and the other Guarantors as guarantors, entered into a euro-denominated senior secured
facilities agreement (the ‘‘Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities’’) with Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft as agent and original lender. The Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities
provide for A75,000,000 of total committed credit, including (i) a A45 million term loan facility
(‘‘Facility A’’), (ii) a A15.0 million term loan facility (‘‘Facility B’’) and (iii) a further A15.0 million term loan
facility (‘‘Facility C’’). Facility A is refinanced by funds made available by KfW under a certain KfW
program that offers subsidized funding for eligible investments that promote energy efficiency. We have
fully utilized both Facility B and Facility C. Unless previously utilized, Facility A will be automatically
utilized on August 10, 2019, provided the proceeds can be used in accordance with the conditions of the
KfW program.

The purpose of the borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities is to fund
certain eligible investments in connection with the proposed establishment of our new paper mill (PM3) in
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. Borrowings under Facility B and Facility C may also be used for other
capital expenditures of the Group if we reasonably conclude that the amounts borrowed count for the
purpose of financing PM3.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Facility A has a final maturity date of September 30, 2028 and Facility B and Facility C have a final
maturity date of September 30, 2028.

We will be required to repay our borrowings under the Facility A in instalments by repaying on each
Facility A repayment date an amount which reduces the amount of the outstanding borrowings under the
Facility A by an amount as set out in the following table:

If Facility A is not utilized in full at the end of the availability period the repayment instalments will,
subject to the consent of KfW, be reduced _pro rata. Should KfW withhold such consent, any unutilized_
amounts will be deducted from the repayment instalments of Facility A in inverse chronological order,
i.e. beginning with the repayment instalment for the last repayment date. In this case, the final maturity
date of Facility A will be deemed to be the last repayment date on which a repayment instalment (or any
part of it) remains to be made.

Under the terms of the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, we may apply for a repayment
grant (Tilgungszuschuss) of up to A7,109,999.85 with regard to Facility A funded from resources of the
German Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi) on the repayment of all amounts borrowed under
Facility A (each a ‘‘KfW Repayment Grant’’). The amounts of the KfW Repayment Grant, if granted, are
to be offset against the repayment instalments with regard to Facility A falling due after the date on which
the KfW Repayment Grant is granted. According to the conditions applicable to the KfW Repayment
Grant, we may only become entitled to the KfW Repayment Grant if, among other things: (i) KfW has
received (via the Agent), in form and substance satisfactory to it, a use of funds certificate together with
the relevant application promptly after the investment funded by Facility A has been made, subject to
certain deadlines. If and to the extent the KfW Repayment Grant is awarded, the amounts granted

190


-----

thereunder are offset against the repayment instalments with regard to Facility A in inverse chronological
order, i.e. beginning with the repayment instalment for the last repayment date with regard to the
Facility A.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loan
outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities by giving ten business days’ prior
notice to the agent and provided KfW has consented to any voluntary prepayment of a loan under Facility
A (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the amount of such loan by a minimum amount of
A5.0 million or the remainder).

If we have not been awarded a KfW Repayment Grant by December 31, 2021 in an amount of at least
A9.0 million which has been offset against the Facility A repayment instalments; then we will on March 31,
2025, in addition to the Facility A repayment instalment, the Facility B repayment instalment and the
Facility C repayment instalment, make a mandatory prepayment (Sondertilgung) in an amount equal to any
shortfall between (i) the amount of any KfW Repayment Grant actually offset against the Facility A
repayment instalments by that date and (ii) A9.0 million. Any such mandatory prepayment shall be applied
against any outstanding Facility B repayment instalments, Facility C repayment instalments due on that
date in inverse chronological order, i.e. beginning with the repayment instalment for the last relevant
repayment date. No Break Costs needs to be paid in case such repayment must be made.

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities require
mandatory cancellation and, if applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes
unlawful for such lender to perform any of its obligations under the Existing Senior Secured
Commerzbank Facilities.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the agent under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities describing the transaction or
transactions that constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation in any
loans and to cancel each Lender’s Commitment under the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank
Facilities in the loans on the date specified in such notice (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) which date shall
be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of
**Control Repayment Date’’) but no later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other**
senior secured debt. Pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, each lender under the Existing Senior
Secured Commerzbank Facilities will have the right to require us to prepay all or any part of the principal
amount of such lender’s participation in the loans plus break costs determined by each lender in
accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an amount requested from such lender by
KfW, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts accrued under the
finance documents, whereupon the Commitments of the Lender will be canceled.

‘‘Change of Control’’, for purposes of the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, means the
occurrence of the following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning
given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding
company), the Issuer becoming aware of (i) any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert
in the meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and
Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a permitted shareholder
acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% issued and
outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares
and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued
and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of
shares than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or
consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

191


-----

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer; or

(v) the Issuer ceases to hold (directly or indirectly) 100% of the shares in Progroup Paper
PM3 GmbH.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility A will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.3% per annum. All borrowings
under the Facility B and the Facility C will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.3% per annum.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 30 at a rate of 0.25% per month with regard to any available but unused commitments in
relation to the Facility A during the period starting on the date falling one day after August 10, 2019, until
the last day of the relevant availability period.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that
closely track those contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the Existing Senior Secured
Commerzbank Facilities require us to submit to KfW, via the agent under the Existing Senior Secured
Commerzbank Facilities, certain use of funds certificates (Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that
we have made use of the funds borrowed under the Facility A in accordance with the specified purpose
described above and relevant KfW program rules. Furthermore, we are required to procure that the
investment measures implemented with the borrowings under the Facility A are operated in accordance
with their designated purpose for a period of at least five (5) years (the ‘‘Minimum Operating Period’’),
and during the Minimum Operating Period, no part of the relevant investments may, subject to the
principle of proportionality, be abandoned or sold-off (unless the further operation in accordance with the
designated purpose is safeguarded).

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, our relationship
with the lenders with regard to Facility A is also governed by the general terms and conditions of KfW,
which are incorporated into the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities by reference. In case of
any conflict between the provisions of the Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities and the general
terms and conditions of KfW, the provisions of the general terms and conditions of KfW will prevail in
relation to the Facility A. In particular, in addition to the customary events of the default contained in the
Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities as described under ‘‘Overview’’ above, the general terms
and conditions of KfW also contain certain bespoke termination rights related to the quasi-governmental
nature of the subsidized funding provided by KfW, through Commerzbank AG, under the Facility A.

**EXISTING SENIOR SECURED HSBC FACILITY**

On August 6, 2018, the Issuer, as company and guarantor, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH as borrower and
guarantor, and the other Guarantors as guarantors, entered into a euro-denominated senior secured
facility agreement (the ‘‘Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility’’) with HSBC Trinkhaus & Burkhardt AG,
as original lender and agent. The Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility provides for a A30,000,000
non-amortizing loan, which Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH may utilize until November 30, 2023.

The dedicated purpose of our borrowings under the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility is to fund or
refinance our proposed investments in connection with the proposed establishment of our new paper mill
(PM3) in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany.

**_Repayments and prepayments_**

The Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility has a final maturity date of December 31, 2023, at which date
Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH will be required to repay the any loans under the Senior Secured HSBC
Facility in full.

Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of the loan made available to it
under the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility by giving not less than three business days’ notice (or
such shorter period as the majority lenders may agree) to the agent (but if in part, being an amount that

192


-----

reduces the amount of the loan by a minimum of A1.0 million or the remainder if the outstanding loan is
less than A1.0 million).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable, prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for
such lender to perform any of its obligations under the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility.

The Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility also provides for a voluntary cancellation, upon a three
business days’ notice, of the whole or any part (being a minimum amount of A1.0 million or the remainder
if the commitments are less than A1.0 million) of the available facility under the Existing Senior Secured
HSBC Facility.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the agent under the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility describing the transaction or transactions
that constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation in any loans under
the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility in the loans and to cancel each lender’s commitment on the
date specified in such notice (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days
and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Repayment Date’’)
but no later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other senior secured debt. Pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer, each lender under the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility will have the
right to require Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH to prepay such lender’s participation in the loans together
with accrued and unpaid interest and any additional amounts accrued under the finance documents in
respect of any such participation in any such loans on the Change of Control Prepayment Date, whereupon
the commitment of that lender will be cancelled.

‘‘Change of Control’’, for purposes of the Existing Senior Secured HSBC Facility, means the occurrence of
the following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning
given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting

shares than such other person or group;

transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries

If a Facility is not utilized in full at the end of its availability period or any loans are repaid or prepaid, the
repayment instalments will, subject to the consent of KfW in case of the Facility A, be reduced pro rata.
Should, in the case of Facility A, KfW withhold such consent, any unutilized amounts will be deducted
from the relevant repayment instalments of the relevant facility in inverse chronological order,
i.e. beginning with the repayment instalment for the last repayment date. In this case, the final maturity

196


-----

date of the relevant facility will be deemed to be the last repayment date on which a repayment instalment
(or any part of it) remains to be made.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of the loan
outstanding under the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities by giving not less than ten business days’
notice (or such shorter period as the majority lenders may agree) (and provided that KfW has consented to
any such a voluntary prepayment of any Facility A Loans) to the agent (but if in part, being an amount that
reduces the amount of the loan by a minimum of A1 million or the remainder if the outstanding loan is less
than A1 million).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities require mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such
lender to perform any of its obligations under the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the agent under the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities describing the transaction or transactions that
constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation in any loans and to cancel
each Lender’s Commitment under the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities in the loans on the date
specified in such notice (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no
later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Repayment Date’’) but no
later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other senior secured debt. Pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, each lender under the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities will have the right to
require us to repay such lender’s participation in any loans together with break costs determined by each
lender in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an amount requested from such
lender by KfW, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts accrued under
the finance documents, whereupon the Commitments of the Lender will be canceled in respect of an such
participation in any such loans on the Change of Control Repayment Date.

‘‘Change of Control’’, for purposes of the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities, means the occurrence of the
following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning
given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding
company), the Issuer becoming aware of (i) any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert
in the meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and
Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a permitted shareholder
acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% issued and
outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares
and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued
and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of
shares than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or
consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility A will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per annum and all borrowings
under the Facility B will bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.05% per annum.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 30 (i) in relation to the Facility A, at a rate of 0.25% per month on the available commitments
in relation to Facility A for the period starting on November, 28, 2019; (ii) and in relation to Facility B, at a

197

rate of 0.55 per cent. per annum on the available commitments in relation to Facility B for the period
starting on the date falling two months after the date of the agreement.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that
closely track those contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the New Senior Secured LBBW
Facilities require us to submit to KfW, via the agent under the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities,
certain use of funds certificates (Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that we have made use of the
funds borrowed under the Facility A in accordance with the specified purpose described above and
relevant KfW program rules.

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities, our relationship with the
lenders under the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities is in case of Facility A also governed by the general
terms and conditions of KfW, which are incorporated into the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities by
reference. In case of any conflict between the provisions of the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and
the general terms and conditions of KfW, the provisions of the general terms and conditions of KfW will
prevail in relation to Facility A. In particular, in addition to the customary events of the default contained
in the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities as described under ‘‘Overview’’ above, the general terms and
conditions of KfW also contain certain bespoke termination rights related to the quasi-governmental
nature of the subsidized funding provided by KfW, through Landesbank Baden-W¨urttemberg, under the
New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities.

If the Facility is not utilized in full at the end of the availability period the repayment instalments will,
subject to the consent of KfW and Saarl¨andische Investitionskreditbank Aktiengesellschaft (the ‘‘SIKB’’),
be reduced _pro rata. Should KfW and/or SIKB withhold such consent, any unutilized amounts will be_
deducted from the repayment instalments in inverse chronological order, i.e. beginning with the repayment
instalment for the last repayment date. In this case, the final maturity date will be deemed to be the last
repayment date on which a repayment instalment (or any part of it) remains to be made.

Subject to the payment of break costs, we may voluntarily prepay the whole or any part of any loan
outstanding under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility by giving ten business days’ prior notice to the
agent (but if in part, being an amount that reduces the amount of such loan by a minimum amount of
EUR 1 million or the remainder).

In addition to voluntary prepayments, the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility requires mandatory
cancellation and, if applicable prepayment in full with respect to any lender, if it becomes unlawful for such
lender to perform any of its obligations under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility.

Furthermore, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the Issuer shall give notice
to the agent under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility describing the transaction or transactions that
constituted the Change of Control and offer to repay each lender’s participation in any loans and to cancel
each Lender’s Commitment under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility in the loans on the date
specified in such notice (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no
later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the ‘‘Change of Control Repayment Date’’) but no
later than the respective Change of Control Offer for any of the other senior secured debt. Pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, each lender under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility will have the right to
require us to repay such lender’s participation in any loans together with break costs determined by each
lender in accordance with applicable law and jurisprudence, at least in an amount requested from such
lender by KfW, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, and any additional amounts accrued under
the finance documents in respect of any such participation in any such loans on the Change of Control
Repayment Date, whereupon the commitments of that Lender will be cancelled.

‘‘Change of Control’’, for purposes of the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, means the occurrence of the
following:

(i) for as long as no public market exists for the capital stock of the Issuer (or a holding company),
the Issuer becoming aware of any person or group of persons acting in concert in the meaning
given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act
(Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a Permitted Shareholder acquiring and
holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 50% issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares;

199


-----

(ii) at any time that a public market exists for the capital stock of the company (or a holding
company), the Issuer becoming aware of (i) any ‘‘person’’ or ‘‘group’’ of persons acting in concert
in the meaning given to such term in Section 2(5) of the German Securities Acquisition and
Takeover Act (Wertpapiererwerbs- und _Ubernahmegesetz[¨]_ ) other than a permitted shareholder
acquiring and holding, directly or indirectly, the control over more than 30% issued and
outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of shares
and (ii) permitted shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, the control over fewer of the issued
and outstanding voting stock of the Issuer measured by voting power rather than number of
shares than such other person or group;

(iii) the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition (other than by way of merger, or
consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole to a person other than a permitted shareholder; or

(iv) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation, winding up or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer.

**_Interest and Fees_**

All borrowings under the Facility bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.00% per annum.

We are also required to pay a commitment fee in arrears on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
December 30 at a rate of 0.25% per month with regard to any available but unused commitments in
relation to the Facility during the period starting on November, 27, 2019, until the last day of the
availability period.

**_Covenants_**

In addition to customary information and general loan style covenants and restrictive covenants that
closely track those contained in the Conditions of Issue of the Notes, the New Senior Secured SaarLB
Facility requires us to submit to KfW, via the agent under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, certain
use of funds certificates (Verwendungsnachweise), providing evidence that we have made use of the funds
borrowed under the Facility, as applicable, in accordance with the specified purpose described above and
relevant KfW program rules.

**_Application of KfW General Terms and Condition; KfW Events of Default_**

In addition to the terms set forth in the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, our relationship with the
lenders under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility is also governed by the general terms and
conditions of KfW, which are incorporated into the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility by reference. In
case of any conflict between the provisions of the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the general
terms and conditions of KfW, the provisions of the general terms and conditions of KfW will prevail. In
particular, in addition to the customary events of the default contained in the New Senior Secured SaarLB
Facility as described under ‘‘Overview’’ above, the general terms and conditions of KfW also contain certain
bespoke termination rights related to the quasi-governmental nature of the subsidized funding provided by
KfW, through Landesbank Saar, under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility.

**INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT**

In connection with the 2015 Refinancing, the Issuer, the then-existing Guarantors, JH-Holding, the
holders’ representative for our then-outstanding senior secured notes, the Security Agent, the agent and
the lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and others entered into an intercreditor
agreement (as amended and/or restated from time to time, the ‘‘Intercreditor Agreement’’) to govern the
relationships and relative priorities among (i) the creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility; (ii) the holders of our then-outstanding senior secured notes; (iii) future hedge counterparties
under certain hedging agreements (the ‘‘Hedge Counterparties’’); (iv) future cash management providers,
(v) certain future creditors of the Group that may accede to the Intercreditor Agreement from time to
time, including the holders of the Floating Rates Notes and the Existing Notes, the lenders under the
Senior Secured Facilities and the holders of the Additional Notes; (vi) certain intra group creditors and
debtors; (vii) various creditor representatives; and (viii) the Security Agent. All Guarantors that were not

200


-----

an original party to the Intercreditor Agreement have subsequently acceded to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Issuer, the Guarantors and each of their subsidiaries that incur any liability or provides any guarantee
or security under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Floating Rate Notes, the Existing Notes
or the Senior Secured Facilities and related documents or any Pari Passu Debt Documents are together
referred to in this description as ‘‘Debtors’’.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for accession by certain additional Pari Passu Debt Creditors (as
defined below) and/or their representatives. The agents under all Senior Secured Facilities we entered into
after the original signing date of the Intercreditor Agreement, on behalf of themselves and on behalf of the
lenders under such Senior Secured Facilities, and Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr¨ufungsgesellschaft, as
holders’ representative on behalf of the holders of the Floating Rate Notes and the Existing Notes, have
entered into creditor/creditor representative accession agreements with regard to the relevant Senior
Secured Facilities, the Floating Rate Notes and the Existing Notes, respectively, as contemplated by the
Intercreditor Agreement. We expect that the agents and original lenders under the New Senior Secured
Facilities will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on or around the issue date of the Additional Notes.
The Additional Notes will constitute Additional Indebtedness (as defined below) for purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement and will therefore be permitted to share in the transaction security that secures
(or will secure, as applicable) the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured
Facilities, the New Senior Secured Facilities and any other Pari Passu Debt. As a result, holders of the
Additional Notes will have equivalent rights to the holders of the Existing Notes and the lenders under the
Senior Secured Facilities under the Intercreditor Agreement and may vote in the same class of creditors as
the holders of the Existing Notes and the lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities in respect of
enforcement.

On May 2, 2018, we entered into an amendment and restatement agreement relating to the Intercreditor
Agreement. In addition to various technical amendments, we amended and restated the definition of
‘‘Credit Facility’’ and related terms in the Intercreditor Agreement to include, in addition to the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain credit facilities which are permitted by the terms of the Pari Passu
Debt Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to share pari passu in the Collateral with the
rights and obligation of Credit Facility Lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) as provided for
in the Intercreditor Agreement, and in respect of which the creditors, facility agent, and arrangers have
acceded as Credit Facility Lenders, Credit Facility Agent or Credit Facility Creditors (as the case may be,
and each as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) and which are permitted to receive priority to the Pari
Passu Debt Liabilities (as defined below) with respect to the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral
(such credit facilities, together with the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, together the ‘‘Credit
**Facilities’’ and each a ‘‘Credit Facility’’). As a result, the total amount of Indebtedness under a Credit**
Facility that may be secured by Liens on a super priority basis increased from up to A50 million to up to
A80 million. In addition, we amended and restated the Intercreditor Agreement to increase the Priority
Hedging Limit (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement from up to A35 million to up to A80 million. The
following description of certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement summarizes the relevant
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement as so amended and restated. It assumes that the agents and
lenders under the New Senior Secured Facilities have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not
restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety nor does it describe provisions relating to the rights and
obligations of holders of other classes of our debt. As such, we urge you to read the Intercreditor
Agreement because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines the rights of the holders of the
Additional Notes.

**_General_**

The Intercreditor Agreement, among other things, sets out:

   - the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

  - when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

  - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

   - the terms pursuant to which that indebtedness will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain
insolvency events;

   - when enforcement actions can be taken in respect of the transaction security;

201


-----

  - turnover provisions; and

   - when the transaction security and guarantees will be released to permit a sale of the collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement contains provisions relating to indebtedness incurred by the Debtors that is
permitted by the terms of the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Notes and the Senior
Secured Facilities, which ranks _pari passu to the Existing Notes and the Senior Secured Facilities and is_
secured by the Collateral (the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt’’, the liabilities of the Debtors in respect thereof, the ‘‘Pari
**Passu Debt Liabilities’’, the creditors thereof, the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt Creditors’’ and all documents or**
instruments entered into between any Debtors and a Pari Passu Debt Creditor setting out the terms of any
credit facility, notes, indenture or debt security which creates or evidences and Pari Passu Debt Liabilities,
the ‘‘Pari Passu Debt Documents’’), subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement allows for a refinancing in full or in part of the Existing Notes, the Senior Secured Facilities
and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility as Additional Indebtedness (as defined below).

**_Ranking and Priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to the provisions regarding permitted payments, that the
right and priority of payment of all present and future liabilities and obligations under the Credit Facilities
(including all present and future liabilities and obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, the ‘‘Credit Facility Liabilities’’), the hedging agreements entered into by the Hedge
Counterparties (the ‘‘Hedging Liabilities’’), the Floating Rate Notes, the Existing Notes and the
Additional Notes (the ‘‘Notes Liabilities’’), certain liabilities owed by any member of the Restricted Group
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) in respect of cash management and treasury services provided
by a cash management provider which has become a party to the Intercreditor Agreement (a ‘‘Cash
**Management Provider’’ and the liabilities owed to such Cash Management Providers, the ‘‘Cash**
**Management Liabilities’’), all present and future liabilities and obligations under the Senior Secured**
Facilities (the ‘‘Existing Senior Secured Facility Liabilities’’) and certain other liabilities will rank in right
and priority of payment in the following order:

   - first, the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities, the Existing Senior
Secured Facility Liabilities, any other Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the Cash Management Liabilities,
the creditor representative liabilities and the liabilities owed to the Security Agent and _pari passu_
and without any preference between them; and

  - second, certain intercompany obligations of the Debtors to the Issuer and its subsidiaries (the
‘‘Intra-Group Liabilities’’) and liabilities owed by any Debtor to the Parent and possibly other
structural creditors (the ‘‘Structural Liabilities’’ and together with the Intercompany Debt, the
‘‘Subordinated Liabilities’’).

The Intercreditor Agreement does not purport to rank the Subordinated Liabilities among themselves.

**_Transaction Security_**

The creditors under the Credit Facilities (including the creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, the ‘‘Credit Facilities Creditors’’), the Hedge Counterparties, the holders of the Existing Notes,
the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities, any other Pari Passu Debt Creditors, the Cash
Management Providers, the creditor representatives and the Security Agent (together, the ‘‘Secured
**Parties’’) benefit from the transaction security (which, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement,**
includes a guarantee granted by the Parent recourse under which shall be limited to the value of the
enforcement proceeds of the security provided are shares of the Issuer and are pledged by the Parent).
Subject to the order of application of proceeds (see ‘‘Application of Proceeds’’ below), the transaction
security shall rank and secure the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities, the Notes Liabilities,
the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, the Cash Management Liabilities, the creditor representative liabilities and
the liabilities owed to the Security Agent _pari passu and without preference between them. Neither_
Ancillary Lenders nor Hedge Counterparties nor Cash Management Providers may take the benefit of any
guarantee or security from members of the Group (other than customary security for ancillary lenders and
hedge counterparties) unless such guarantee or security is also offered (to the extent legally possible) for
the benefit of the other Secured Parties. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
guarantees and transaction security will be released in certain circumstances described further below in
_‘‘—Release of Security—Non distressed Disposals’’ and ‘‘—Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed_
_Disposals’’._

202


-----

**_Permitted Payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits payments to be made by the Debtors under the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, the Floating Rate Notes, the Existing Notes, the Senior Secured Facilities, the
Additional Notes and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents (provided such payments are permitted under
those documents). The Intercreditor Agreement also permits payments to creditors of Intra-Group
Liabilities, provided that there has been no acceleration event in respect of the Credit Facilities (including
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility), the Senior Secured Facilities, the Floating Rate Notes, the
Existing Notes, the Additional Notes or any other Pari Passu Debt (subject to exceptions). No payments
may be made in respect of Structural Liabilities except as permitted by the Credit Facilities (including the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility), the Senior Secured Facilities, the Existing Notes Documents, the
Conditions of Issue and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents or if the required majority of each class of
debt has consented. There are also restrictions on payments to Hedge Counterparties subject to except
certain specified permitted payments.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

For the purposes of enforcement, the Credit Facility Creditors (including the creditors under the Super
Senior Revolving Credit Facility), any Hedge Counterparty to the extent of their Priority Hedging
Liabilities and the Cash Management Providers are referred to as the ‘‘Super Senior Creditors’’. Hedging
Liabilities may be designated as Priority Hedging Liabilities if they are in relation to foreign currency
hedging and/or interest rate hedging and the designated mark-to-market amount in respect of those
Hedging Liabilities does not exceed an aggregate amount of A80,000,000 (the ‘‘Priority Hedging Limit’’).

If the transaction security has become enforceable and any of the Super Senior Creditors, the holders of
the Floating Rate Notes, the Existing Notes or the Additional Notes (acting through the relevant holders’
representative), the creditors under the Senior Secured Facilities or any other Pari Passu Debt Creditors
wish to enforce the transaction security, either (a) the Majority Super Senior Creditors or (b) the Majority
Pari Passu Creditors must give notice of the proposed instructions as to enforcement (the ‘‘Shared Security
**Notice’’) to the creditor representatives for the other creditor classes and the Security Agent. The giving of**
this notice triggers a 30 day consultation period during which time the creditor representatives for each of
the creditor classes must discuss the proposals in good faith with a view to formulating joint enforcement.
During the consultation period, but subject to certain exceptions, the Secured Parties may not accelerate
their respective Liabilities owed to them under the Debt Documents nor closeout any hedging
transactions.

The ‘‘Majority Super Senior Creditors’’ means those Super Senior Creditors whose participations in the
Credit Facility Liabilities, terminated Priority Hedging Liabilities and Cash Management Liabilities exceed
66[2]⁄3 per cent. Of the aggregate participations in the Credit Facility Liabilities, Priority Hedging Liabilities
and Cash Management Liabilities. The ‘‘Majority Pari Passu Creditors’’ means a simple majority of the
aggregate of (i) the outstanding principal amount of a combined class of holders of the Pari Passu Debt
Creditors (including holders of the Floating Rate Notes, the Existing Notes and the Additional Notes and
the creditors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and (ii) the outstanding amount owed by any
Debtor to the non-priority hedge counterparties.

A creditor representative is not obliged to consult as described above (or shall only be obliged to consult
for a shorter period) if:

   - an insolvency event has occurred and is continuing in relation to a Debtor;

   - an event of default is continuing in relation to liabilities owed to the relevant creditor group and
that creditor group (acting in good faith) determines, and notifies the creditor representatives, that
to do so and thereby delay enforcement could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on (A) the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any of the transaction security; or (B) the
realization proceeds available to that creditor group of any enforcement of the transaction security
in any material respect; or

   - the creditor representatives so agree.

**_Conflicting Enforcement Instructions_**

At the end of the consultation period, the Security Agent shall act on the instructions of the Instructing
Group. If the Security Agent does not receive any instructions from the Instructing Group as to

203


-----

enforcement following the consultation period, the Security Agent shall take no action. The Instructing
Group consists of (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and (ii) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, in
each case acting through their creditor representatives. If there are conflicting enforcement instructions
given to the Security Agent by the different classes of creditors who can constitute the Instructing Group
(or if a creditor representative of a class of creditors fails to give instructions), then provided that the
Majority Pari Passu Creditors have complied with the consultation obligations in the Intercreditor
Agreement and those instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles (see further
below), the instructions as to enforcement from the Majority Pari Passu Creditors will prevail over those of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu Creditors will constitute the Instructing
Group.

If (a) the Security Agent has not taken any enforcement action within 3 months of the date of the first
shared security notice was issued; (b) the Super Senior Creditors have not been repaid in full in cash within
6 months of the date the first Shared Security Notice was issued; or (c) an insolvency event occurs in
respect of a Debtor and the Security Agent has not commenced enforcement, any enforcement instructions
given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will then prevail, provided that they are consistent with the
security enforcement principles.

Any enforcement instructions given must comply with certain security enforcement principles which
include:

   - achieving the security enforcement objective, which is to maximize, so far as is consistent with the
prompt and expeditious realization of value from enforcement of the transaction security, the
recoveries of all Secured Parties;

   - all enforcement proceeds will be received in cash by the Security Agent or sufficient enforcement
proceeds will be received in cash by the Security Agent to ensure that after distribution in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Credit Facility Liabilities, Priority Hedging
Liabilities and Cash Management Liabilities will be repaid and discharged in full;

   - all enforcement action must be prompt and expeditious and reasonably expected to realize proceeds
from enforcement within six months of receipt by the Security Agent of initial enforcement
instructions;

  - to the extent that the enforcement is over transaction security with an aggregate book value
exceeding A5,000,000 (or its equivalent) or over all of the shares in a member of the restricted group
which are secured, the Security Agent shall obtain an opinion from a ‘‘big four’’ accounting firm, a
recognized independent investment bank or other reputable independent third party professional
firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of the relevant type and size of assets, as to
whether the amount received in connection with such enforcement is fair from a financial point of
view taking into account all relevant circumstances (the ‘‘Financial Advisor Opinion’’);

   - the Financial Advisor Opinion will be conclusive evidence that the security enforcement objective
and the security enforcement principles have been met; and

   - if the enforcement is by way of public auction, no Financial Advisor Opinion is required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exclusions, if any Credit Facility Creditor, Pari Passu Debt Creditor, Hedge
Counterparty (or any of their respective creditor representatives), a Cash Management Provider or the
Holders’ Representative receives or recovers the proceeds of any enforcement of any transaction security,
except in accordance with ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’ below, that person must:

   - in relation to amounts not received or recovered by way of set off, hold that amount (net of third
party costs and taxes) on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay an amount equal to that
amount (net of third party costs and taxes) to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

  - in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery (net of third party costs and taxes) to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

There is also a general turnover obligation on the subordinated creditors to turnover to the Security Agent
all amounts which are not permitted payments made in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

204


-----

**_Application of Proceeds_**

All amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent as Enforcement Proceeds (as
defined under the Intercreditor Agreement) or otherwise paid to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the provisions described under this paragraph shall be held on trust by the Security Agent
and applied at any time as the Security Agent (in its discretion) sees fit, to the extent permitted by law, in
the following order:

   - first, in discharging any sums owing to the Security Agent, any receiver or any delegate;

   - second, pari passu and pro rata, to each creditor representative, including all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any enforcement;

  - third, pari passu and pro rata, in payment to the creditor representative of the Lenders for
application towards the discharge of the Credit Facility Liabilities (including liabilities under the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility), to the arrangers of any Credit Facilities, the Hedge
Counterparties in respect of their Priority Hedging Liabilities and the Cash Management Providers;

  - fourth, pari passu and _pro rata, in payment to (i) the respective paying agent on behalf of the_
holders of the Notes for application towards the discharge of the Notes Liabilities in accordance
with the Notes Documents; (ii) the creditor representatives of the other Pari Passu Debt Creditors
for application towards the discharge of the other Pari Passu Debt; and (iii) the Hedge
Counterparties for application towards the discharge of the non priority hedging obligations;

   - fifth, in payment to any person the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor; and

   - sixth, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Debtor.

**_Option to Purchase_**

Any Pari Passu Debt Creditors (including the holders of the Existing Notes and the Notes and the creditors
under the Existing Senior Secured Facilities) may, after an Acceleration Event or an enforcement, and
subject to various conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement (including the grant of an acceptable
indemnity against clawback to the relevant lenders / creditors), exercise an option to purchase in full and in
cash the Credit Facility Liabilities, any Pari Passu Liabilities incurred to refinance the Credit Facility
Liabilities in full, any Priority Hedging Liabilities and any Cash Management Liabilities, at par.

**_Release of Security—Non Distressed Disposals_**

In circumstances where (i) a disposal is not a distressed disposal (i.e., a disposal to a person or persons
outside the Group of an asset by a Debtor which is subject to the transaction security or a disposal of the
shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor which is permitted by the terms of any Credit
Facility, the conditions of issue of the Floating Rate Notes and Existing Notes, the Conditions of Issue, the
Senior Secured Facilities and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents) or (ii) any transaction pursuant to
which security shall be granted over any asset which is subject to transaction security to a person which is
not a secured creditor and a corresponding release of transaction security is permitted under the terms of
any Credit Facility, the conditions of issue of the Floating Rate Notes and Existing Notes, the Conditions
of Issue, the Senior Secured Facilities and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement provides that the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed to deliver:

   - any release of the transaction security and any other claim over that asset;

   - where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, any release of the transaction security
and any other claim over that Debtor’s property and/or the shares in, and property of, any of its
subsidiaries; and

   - issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may,
in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable.

**_Release of Security—Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

If a member of the Group is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of each
of the Credit Facilities, the conditions of issue of the Floating Rate Notes and Existing Notes, the
Conditions of Issue, the Senior Secured Facilities and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Security

205


-----

Agent is irrevocably authorized and obliged (at the cost of the relevant debtor and the Issuer and without
any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or debtor):

  - to release the transaction security or any other claim (relating to a debt document) over that
member of the Group’s assets; and

   - to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the transaction security or any claim described in
the paragraph above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of any floating charge or any
consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be considered necessary or
desirable or as requested by the Issuer.

**_Release of Security and Guarantees—Distressed Disposals_**

In circumstances where a distressed disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and instructed:

   - to release the transaction security or any other claim over the relevant asset and execute and deliver
or enter into any release of that transaction security, or claim and issue any letters of
non-crystallization of any floating charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the
Security Agent, be considered necessary or desirable;

   - if the asset that is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release (i) that Debtor
and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities and certain other liabilities; (ii) any transaction security granted over that Debtor’s assets
and the assets of any of its subsidiaries; and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or intra Group lender
over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor;

   - if the asset that is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor,
to release (i) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any part
of its borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and certain other liabilities; (ii) any transaction
security granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its
assets; and (iii) any other claim of a Debtor or intra Group lender over the assets of any holding
company or any subsidiary of that holding company;

   - if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company
of a Debtor, to dispose of all or any part of that Debtor’s or the holding company that Debtor’s
borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities, certain other liabilities, and other intra Group
receivables; and

   - if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or any holding company
of a Debtor, to transfer Intra Group Liabilities and debtor liabilities owed by that Debtor or holding
company of a Debtor to another Debtor.

Any net proceeds of the disposal must be applied in accordance with the enforcement proceeds waterfall
described under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’.

**_Amendment_**

The Intercreditor Agreement may only be amended with the consent of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, the required percentage of Pari Passu Debt Creditors (as set out in the relevant Pari Passu Debt
Documents), or the written consent of the creditor representative of the Pari Passu Debt Creditors (acting
in accordance with the terms of the relevant Pari Passu Debt Documents), the Issuer and the Security
Agent unless it relates to certain specified matters such as ranking, priority, turnover, redistribution,
enforcement, disposal proceeds, application of enforcement proceeds and security enforcement principles.
Such amendments require consent from all Super Senior Creditors, the holders of the Floating Rate Notes,
the Existing Notes and the Additional Notes (acting through the relevant holders’ representative and in
accordance with the relevant conditions of issue), the other Pari Passu Debt Creditors (including the
lenders under the Senior Secured Facilities), and each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent such
amendments adversely affect it), each Cash Management Provider (to the extent such amendment
adversely affects it) and the Security Agent; provided that where an amendment or waiver only relates to
the ranking order of priority or subordination or, or application of proceeds of enforcement to creditors
ranking after any other group of creditors, the consent of such other group of creditors shall not be
required.

No amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or
withdraw or reduce the rights of any party (other than in a way which affects creditors of that party’s class
generally) to the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior consent of that party or in the case of a
Debtor, to the extent consented to by the Issuer.

The Intercreditor Agreement may be amended without the consent of the holders of the Notes in certain
circumstances. For more information, see ‘‘Description of the Notes—Covenants—Amendment and
_Restatement of Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’._

To the extent the Debtors wish to enter into additional Pari Passu Debt or other additional or replacement
indebtedness (‘‘Additional Indebtedness’’) which is permitted to share in the transaction security pursuant
to any Credit Facility, the conditions of issue of the Floating Rate Notes and Existing Notes, the
Conditions of Issue and any other Pari Passu Debt Documents, then the parties to the Intercreditor
Agreement may be required to enter into a replacement intercreditor agreement on substantially the same
terms as the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement also permits the Security Agent (subject to the terms of any Credit Facility)
to enter into new or supplemental security and/or release and retake transaction security if certain
conditions are met.

**_Governing law_**

The Intercreditor Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it
are governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with German law.

**EXISTING NOTES**

On March 27, 2018, the Issuer issued A450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.000% senior
secured notes due 2026 (the ‘‘Existing Notes’’). The Existing Notes are issued under the Conditions of
Issue pursuant to German law. The Additional Notes will constitute an increase (Aufstockung), will have
the same terms as the Existing Notes in all respects and be consolidated with and form a single series
(Gesamtemission) with the Existing Notes for all purposes, including without limitation, waivers,
amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. For a description of the terms of the Additional Notes,
see ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ below.

**OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS**

**Forfaiting Program**

Our subsidiary Progroup Board GmbH finances a portion of its trade receivables through an off balance
sheet forfaiting program with CommerzFactoring GmbH. Under the forfaiting program it sells trade
receivables to CommerzFactoring GmbH on a non recourse basis in return for immediate cash payments.
The forfaiting transactions occur up to a maximum aggregate transaction volume of A15 million. As of

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

Progroup AG, a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) organized under German law (the ‘‘Issuer’’) will
issue A150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated 3.000% additional senior secured
notes due 2026 (the ‘‘Additional Notes’’) in accordance with the conditions of issue governing the Notes
dated the Issue Date. The Additional Notes will be issued as ‘‘Additional Notes’’ under the conditions of
issue (the ‘‘Conditions of Issue’’), pursuant to which the Issuer issued, on March 27, 2018 (the ‘‘Issue
**Date’’),** A450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.000% senior secured fixed rate notes due 2026
(the ‘‘Existing Notes’’ and, together with the Additional Notes, the ‘‘Notes’’). The Additional Notes will
constitute an increase (Aufstockung) of the Existing Notes and will have the same terms as the Existing
Notes in all respects and will be consolidated with and form a single series (Gesamtemission) with the
Existing Notes for all purposes, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and
offers to purchase. In this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’, the term ‘‘Issuer’’ refers to Progroup AG only and not
to any of its Subsidiaries.

The following describes the material provisions of the Notes, the Conditions of Issue, the Guarantee
Agreement, the Security Documents and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and is subject, and is
qualified in its entirety by reference, to all of the provisions of the Notes, the Conditions of Issue, the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. We urge you to read the Conditions of Issue, the
Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement because they,
and not this description, define your rights as holders of the Notes. Copies of the Conditions of Issue, the
Notes, the Guarantee Agreement, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available
as set forth under ‘‘Available Information’’. You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this
description under the subheading ‘‘—Certain Definitions’’.

**General**

**_The Additional Notes_**

The Additional Notes will be governed by German law and will:

   - constitute senior obligations of the Issuer;

   - rank equal in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future obligations that are not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations under the Existing Notes, the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Facilities, Priority Hedging Obligations
and Cash Management Liabilities;

   - be secured by the Collateral (as defined below) along with obligations under the Existing Notes, the
Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Facilities, Priority Hedging Obligations
and Cash Management Liabilities (but will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral
(as defined below) only after all obligations secured on a super priority basis, including obligations
under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash
Management Liabilities, have been paid in full);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer;

   - rank effectively senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the
Issuer, to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined below) that is available to satisfy the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes;

   - be effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s existing and future secured Indebtedness that is secured
by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of such property or
assets securing such Indebtedness; and

   - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that
are not Guarantors (as defined below).

**_The Note Guarantees_**

The Notes will initially be guaranteed on a senior basis by each Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer which
guarantees the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Facilities
(the ‘‘Initial Note Guarantees’’). The Notes will be guaranteed by Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup
Logistics GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup Power 1 GmbH,

208


-----

Progroup Board s.r.o., Progroup Board sp. z o.o. and Progroup Board Ltd. (each an ‘‘Initial Guarantor’’
and such entities collectively the ‘‘Initial Guarantors’’).

The Guarantors, jointly and severally, guarantee by way of an independent payment obligation
(selbst¨andiges Zahlungsversprechen) unconditionally and irrevocably, on (subject to the limitations set out
below) a senior basis, the full and punctual payment of all amounts payable under the Notes when due.
The Note Guarantees are agreed in a separate agreement entered into among Wilmington Trust (London)
Limited, as Security Agent, and each Guarantor (the ‘‘Guarantee Agreement’’).

The Note Guarantees do not constitute contracts for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or the
Holders’ Representative (as defined below) from time to time as third party beneficiaries in accordance
with Section 328(1) of the German Civil Code (B¨urgerliches Gesetzbuch) and do not give rise to the right of
each holder of any Notes or the Holders’ Representative to require performance of the Note Guarantees
directly from the Guarantors and to enforce the Note Guarantees directly against the Guarantors. A copy
of the Guarantee Agreement may be inspected and obtained free of charge at the principal office of the
Paying Agent during normal business hours.

The Issuer may from time to time be required to procure from certain of its Subsidiaries (each, an
‘‘Additional Guarantor’’, and collectively with the Initial Guarantors, the ‘‘Guarantors’’) the issuance of
additional guarantees pursuant to the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Covenants—Future Guarantors’’ below.
Any such guarantee (an ‘‘Additional Note Guarantee’’ and, together with the Initial Note Guarantees, the
‘‘Note Guarantees’’) shall be issued on substantially the same terms as the Initial Note Guarantees and be
subject to limitations and restrictions as set forth under ‘‘—Covenants—Future Guarantors’’. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations_
_on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity_
_and enforceability’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and Security Interests’’._

The term ‘‘Note Guarantees’’ shall also include any such Additional Note Guarantees and the term
‘‘Guarantors’’ shall also include any such Additional Guarantors.

The obligations under the Note Guarantees issued by Guarantors will be limited as necessary under the
terms of such Note Guarantees to prevent the Note Guarantees from constituting a fraudulent conveyance
under applicable laws, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable laws, including with respect to
maintenance of share capital and other applicable statutory provisions. The Note Guarantees may be
subject to claims that they should be subordinated or voided in favor of our existing and future creditors
under capital maintenance and other laws in Germany and other relevant jurisdictions.

Subject to the above, the Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

   - constitute direct, unconditional and irrevocable senior obligations of such Guarantor;

   - rank equal in right of payment with all of such Guarantor’s existing and future obligations that are
not subordinated in right of payment to the relevant Guarantee, including obligations under the
Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Facilities, Priority
Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities;

   - be secured by the Collateral along with its obligations under the Existing Notes, the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Facilities, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash
Management Liabilities (but will receive proceeds from an enforcement of the Collateral only after
all obligations secured on a super priority basis, including its obligations under the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities, have
been paid in full);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the relevant
Guarantor;

   - effectively rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future unsecured obligations of the
relevant Guarantor, to the extent of the value of the Collateral that is available to satisfy the
obligations of the relevant Guarantor under the applicable Note Guarantee;

   - effectively rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future obligations of the relevant
Guarantor secured on the Collateral on a basis junior to the Notes, to the extent of the value of the
Collateral that is available to satisfy the obligations under the applicable Note Guarantee;

209


-----

   - be subject to limitations described herein; and

  - be effectively subordinated to such Guarantor’s existing and future secured Indebtedness that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Guarantee of such Guarantor, to the extent of
the value of such property or assets securing such Indebtedness.

Not all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries guarantee or will guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy,
liquidation or reorganization of any of these non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their
assets to the Issuer or any Guarantor. As of and for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2019, the
existing Guarantors accounted, on a consolidated basis, for 90.2% of the consolidated revenues (effects of
intragroup transactions eliminated), 99.5% of EBITDA (effects of intragroup transactions eliminated) and
96.4% of the consolidated total assets (effects of intragroup relations eliminated), respectively.

The operations of the Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries and, therefore the Issuer depends on
the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Notes. The
Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and
commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.
See ‘‘Risks Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally
_subordinated to the liabilities of our non-guarantor subsidiaries’’._

**_Additional Notes_**

The Issuer may, without the consent of the Holders, issue additional Notes under the Conditions of Issue
from time to time after this Offering having the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or
in all respects except for the issue date, the commencement of interest payment obligations and/or the
issue price). Any such issuance of additional Notes is subject to all of the covenants in the Conditions of
Issue including the covenant described below under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’. The
Notes and any additional Notes subsequently issued under the Conditions of Issue will be consolidated
with, form a single series with and increase the aggregate principal amount of the Notes; _provided,_
however, that any additional notes that are not fungible with the Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes shall have a separate common code, ISIN or other identifying number different from the Notes.
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ to the Notes include the
Notes and any additional Notes that are issued.

**_Principal, Maturity and Interest_**

The Issuer will issue A150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Additional Notes in this Offering. The
Notes will mature on March 31, 2026 (the ‘‘Maturity Date’’) at their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the Maturity Date. The Additional Notes will be issued
in denominations of A1,000, which will be transferable only in minimum aggregate principal amounts of
A100,000 and integral multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof.

Interest on the Additional Notes will accrue on their outstanding aggregate principal amount at the rate of
3.000% per annum from and including March 31, 2019 to but excluding the Maturity Date and will be
payable semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30 of each year, commencing on
September 30, 2019. The Notes shall cease to bear interest at the end of the day immediately preceding the
relevant due date for repayment. Interest on the Additional Notes will accrue from March 31, 2019 or, if
interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the
basis of a 360 day year comprised of twelve 30 day months.

A Default shall occur, irrespective of any notice, if any amounts payable under the Notes are not paid
when due. Any due and unpaid amount of principal shall, irrespective of any notice and for so long as such
Default remains outstanding, bear additional default interest at a rate equal to 1% per annum from and
including the relevant due date to but excluding the date of payment.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on such Notes will be subject to the relevant
procedures of Clearstream Banking AG, Frankfurt am Main (‘‘Clearstream Banking’’). If a particular
interest payment date is not a Business Day, then the payment date will move to the next Business Day,
and the Holders of such Notes will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of
any such delay.

210


-----

Payments of principal, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, and interest on the Notes will be made to
the Paying Agent for on-payment to the clearing system or to its order for credit to the respective account
holders of the clearing system and, in case of principal, upon presentation and surrender of the Global
Notes. See ‘‘—Book-Entry; Delivery and Form’’. Payments to the clearing system or to its order shall to the
extent of amounts so paid constitute the discharge of the Issuer from its corresponding liabilities under the
Notes. No service charge will be payable for any registration of transfer or redemption of Notes, but the
Issuer may require payment in certain circumstances of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or other
similar governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.

**_Book-entry; Delivery and Form_**

The Additional Notes will be represented by two global notes in bearer form without interest coupons, one
of which shall represent Additional Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers (as defined in, and in
reliance on, Rule 144A under the Securities Act) (such global note, the ‘‘144A Global Note’’) and the other
of which shall represent Additional Notes sold outside the United States to persons other than U.S.
persons as defined in, and in reliance on, Regulation S under the Securities Act (such global note, the ‘‘Reg
**S Global Note’’ and, together with the 144A Global Note, the ‘‘Global Notes’’). Definitive notes representing**
individual Notes and interest coupons shall not be issued. The Global Notes will be deposited with
Clearstream Banking. Ownership of interests in the Global Notes, referred to as ‘‘book-entry interests’’,
will be limited to persons that have accounts with Clearstream Banking (such persons, ‘‘participants’’) or
persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-entry interests will be shown on, and
transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Clearstream
Banking and its participants.

**_Security; Release of Collateral_**

The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees
will initially be secured by the Issuer Share Pledges and the payment obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will be secured by Liens (subject to any Permitted
Collateral Liens, applicable perfection requirements and exceptions and limitations described herein) over
the collateral set out below (collectively, with the Issuer Share Pledges, the ‘‘Collateral’’):

(a) pledges over the shares and stock interests, as applicable, in Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup
Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup Logistics GmbH, Progroup
Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Board sp. z o.o., Progroup Board s.r.o., Progroup Board S.A.S. and
Progroup Board Ltd.;

(b) security interests over receivables of the Parent against the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries;

(c) pledges over certain bank accounts with banks in Germany of the Issuer;

(d) security interests over certain real property located in Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic,
as applicable, of Progroup Board GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper
PM2 GmbH, Progroup Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Board s.r.o. and Progroup Board sp. z o.o.; and

(e) security interests over certain installations, machines and other business equipment of Progroup
Board GmbH, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, Progroup Paper PM2 GmbH, Progroup
Power 1 GmbH, Progroup Board s.r.o., and Progroup Board sp. z o.o. and Progroup Board Ltd.

The Additional Notes are intended to benefit from the same liens over the Collateral as the Existing Notes,
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Facilities. In order to address any
potential legal uncertainty in certain jurisdictions on this point with regard to certain liens, however, we
will enter into separate confirmation agreements and/or amendment agreements with regard to such liens
on or before the issue date of the Additional Notes. In addition, we will create supplemental and/or
additional junior ranking liens over certain assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors that form part of the
Collateral in certain jurisdictions. Such additional liens will secure all the Notes. In certain jurisdictions,
such supplemental and/or additional liens over the Collateral, because they are being granted at a later
point in time, will rank junior to security interests in the Collateral granted in favor of the Existing Notes,
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Existing Senior Secured Facilities. However, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the benefit of the first and junior ranking pledges over the
Collateral shall be shared equally among the Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility Lenders, the Senior Secured Facility Lenders, the creditors of the Priority
Hedging Obligations and the creditors of the Cash Management Liabilities, provided that any liabilities in

211


-----

respect of obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and
Cash Management Liabilities that are secured by assets that also secure the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantors’ obligations under Note Guarantees will receive priority with respect to any
proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets.

In determining whether and what additional collateral and guarantees may be provided the Agreed
Security Principles as set forth in the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility will be taken into account.
According to such principles, guarantees shall not be granted and collateral shall not be created, perfected
or registered in particular to the extent that it would be likely to:

  - result in any breach of general statutory limitations, capital maintenance, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, financial assistance or thin-capitalisation rules or other similar laws or
regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction;

   - result in any risk that the directors and officers of the relevant grantor of collateral or guarantees
could be held to be (i) in breach of their fiduciary duties and/or (ii) company or criminal law;

   - result in costs that are disproportionate to the benefit obtained by the beneficiaries of that collateral
and including, but not limited to, the materiality of the proposed collateral in light of the aggregate
collateral already granted; or

  - result in an undue administrative burden on, or material inconvenience to the ordinary course of
operations of the provider of the collateral and the guarantee or prejudice any commercial
relationships of such parties.

Furthermore, any assets (other than shares) subject to pre-existing third-party arrangements which are
permitted by the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and which prevent those assets from being charged
will be excluded from any relevant Security Document. Also, no guarantee or security shall be required
from any member of the Group that is a joint venture (where that joint venture is entered into between a
member of the Group and an independent third party joint venture partner) or from any entity in which a
member of the Group holds a minority interest and no security will be required over the shares held by any
member of the Group in a joint venture (where that joint venture is entered into between a member of the
Group and an independent third party joint venture partner).

The share pledges, the interest pledges and the account pledges indicated above will be established
pursuant to the Security Documents with the Security Agent acting for the benefit of the Holders, the
holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Lenders and the Senior Secured
Facility Lenders. The other Collateral will be established pursuant to the Security Documents with the
Security Agent acting for the benefit of the Holders, the holders of the Existing Notes, the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility Lenders and the Senior Secured Facility Lenders being the legal holder of the
security interests in the Collateral. Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can
only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions which, in the case of some
Collateral, will not be completed until after the issue date of the Additional Notes (including security
interests over certain real property which perfection requirements will be satisfied only until after the issue
date of the Additional Notes).

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, if machinery, other equipment or real property are acquired by
the Issuer or any Guarantor that is not automatically subject to a perfected security interest under the
Security Documents and which will be subject to a security interest in favor of the holders of the Existing
Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Lenders or the Senior Secured Facility Lenders, then (to
the extent the security interest is not already granted in favor of the Security Agent for the Holders) the
Issuer or such Guarantor will within three months, with respect to acquired machinery or other equipment,
and within six months, with respect to acquired real property, provide security over such assets in favor of
the Security Agent. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, no security shall be granted in favor of the
Security Agent or the Holders over any such assets which are subject to any Liens granted or created in
accordance with clauses (13)(b), (15), (23), (29), (30) or (31) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’.

The Security Agent will (i) release the Liens over the shares, property and other assets constituting
Collateral in accordance with the terms provided therefor in the Conditions of Issue, the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) at the request of the Issuer, a Guarantor or another
security provider upon having received an Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel certifying
compliance with this paragraph, release the relevant Collateral or execute such other appropriate
instrument evidencing such release (in the form provided by and at the expense of the Issuer or the

212


-----

relevant security provider) under one or more of the following circumstances (without any such release
requiring the consent of the Holders’ Representative or the Holders):

(a) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of such
property or assets to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction)
the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition does not violate the provisions described under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets’’ below and is otherwise in compliance with the Conditions of Issue;_

(b) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Conditions of Issue, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor
which was part of the Collateral;

(c) if the Issuer designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary as
permitted under and in compliance with the Conditions of Issue, the release of the property,
assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary;

(d) upon redemption of all the Notes;

(e) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Notes as provided below under ‘‘—Legal
_Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’;_

(f) in connection with an enforcement action taken by certain secured creditors of the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(g) as provided for under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’;

(h) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under ‘‘—Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation’’;_

(i) with respect to any property or assets that become Collateral securing the Notes and/or any Note
Guarantee pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the covenant ‘‘—Limitation on Liens’’, upon the release
and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of the Initial Lien (as defined
below), to the extent that such Lien does not secure any other Indebtedness on a pari passu basis
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(j) with respect to the Issuer Share Pledges and any Collateral consisting of the type of assets listed
under clause (b) of the definition of ‘‘Collateral’’ set out above, upon the release and discharge
(other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens) over such Collateral securing Indebtedness, so long as no Event of Default exists at such
time or would arise as a result of such release;

(k) with respect to any Collateral (other than the Issuer Share Pledges and any Collateral consisting
of the type of assets listed under clause (b) of the definition of ‘‘Collateral’’ set out above), upon
the release and discharge (other than as a result of an enforcement action) of any and all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens) over such Collateral securing Indebtedness, so long as no Event of
Default exists at such time or would arise as a result of such release; provided that at the time of
such release a Rating Triggering Period is in effect;

(l) as provided for in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(m) in connection with the granting or creation of any Liens on assets or property in accordance with
clauses (13)(b), (15), (23), (29), (30) or (31) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’; provided that
if the relevant Collateral constitutes real property, (i) the relevant real property or portion of real
property constitutes un-built land without any building constructed thereon; (ii) the Security
Agent shall only be required to release the Liens on a portion of the real property as reasonably
required (as determined in good faith by the Issuer’s Board of Directors) for the realization of
the relevant Packaging Park Project; and (iii) any division of real property, if applicable, shall not
materially impair the value of the portion of the remaining real property (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer’s Board of Directors); provided further that the Security Agent shall take any
other actions reasonably requested by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to permit the creation
of first-ranking Liens over the relevant assets or property in accordance with clauses (13)(b), (15),

213


-----

(23), (29), (30) or (31) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens’’, including by facilitating the division
of any relevant real property into separate parcels.

The Security Agent shall be entitled to accept such Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel
as sufficient evidence of compliance with this paragraph, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding
on the Holders.

The Security Agent will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing
the Notes and the Note Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Conditions of Issue, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the
Holders or any action on the part of the Holders’ Representative.

The creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the creditors under the Senior Secured
Facilities (following accession to the Intercreditor Agreement on or about the issue date of the Additional
Notes, in the case of the creditors under the New Senior Secured Facilities), and the Holders’
Representative, in its own name and on behalf of the Holders, appointed Wilmington Trust (London)
Limited, as Security Agent, to act as their agent and security trustee under the Intercreditor Agreement
and the Security Documents and irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to:

(a) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to
them under the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, together with any other
incidental rights, power and discretions;

(b) execute each Security Document on their behalf and any waiver, modification, amendment,
renewal or replacement permitted by the Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor Agreement;
and

(c) administer and enforce any security interest with respect to any Collateral, subject to the terms
and conditions and limitations contained in the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer under its financing arrangements, including without
limitation the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Facilities, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, certain Hedging Obligations and certain Cash Management Liabilities, will be governed by
the Intercreditor Agreement entered into on April 29, 2015 between, among others, the Issuer, the
Guarantors, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Lenders and the Security Agent. The Intercreditor
Agreement provides for accession by certain additional Pari Passu Debt Creditors (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) and/or their representatives. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, as agent under
the Senior Secured PLN Facilities and on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Secured PLN Facilities,
Goldman Sachs International and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, as additional lenders under the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, as agent under the Senior Secured GBP
Facility and on behalf of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as original lender under the Senior Secured GBP
Facility, IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, as agent and original lender under the Senior Secured EUR
Facility, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, as agent and original lender under the Existing Senior Secured
Commerzbank Facilities, HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG, as agent and original lender under the Existing
Senior Secured HSBC Facility, Landesbank Saar as agent and original lender under the Existing Senior
Secured SaarLB Facility, and Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr¨ufungsgesellschaft, as holders’ representative
on behalf of the holders of the Existing Floating Rate Notes, have entered into creditor/creditor
representative accession agreements with regard to the Senior Secured PLN Facilities, the Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, the Senior Secured EUR Facility, the
Existing Senior Secured Commerzbank Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured SaarLB Facility and the
Existing Floating Rate Notes, respectively, as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement. We expect
that Erste Bank Group AG as lender and agent under the New Senior Secured Erste Bank Facility,
Landesbank Baden-W¨urttemberg as lender and agent under the New Senior Secured LBBW Facilities and
Landesbank Saar as lender and agent under the New Senior Secured SaarLB Facility, will accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement on or around the issue date of the Additional Notes. The Additional Notes will
constitute Additional Indebtedness (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) for purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement and will therefore be permitted to share in the Collateral that also secures (or will
secure, as applicable) the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Facilities and any

other Pari Passu Debt Liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities in
respect of obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and
Cash Management Liabilities that are secured by assets that also secure the Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes and the Guarantors’ obligations under Note Guarantees will receive priority with respect to any
proceeds received upon any enforcement action over any such assets. Any proceeds received upon any
enforcement action over any Collateral, after all obligations under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility, Priority Hedging Obligations and Cash Management Liabilities, as well as all obligations owing to
the Security Agent, any receiver or delegate have been repaid from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata
in repayment of all obligations under the Conditions of Issue and the Notes and any other Pari Passu Debt
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) of the Issuer and the Guarantors permitted to be incurred and
secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor Agreement.

**Release of Note Guarantees**

A Note Guarantee shall be released and discharged, automatically, unconditionally and without further
action on the part of the Security Agent:

(a) in the case of a Note Guarantee of a Guarantor, in the event of any sale, exchange or transfer
(including by merger or otherwise) (i) of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor, after which the
applicable Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) of all or substantially all the
assets of such Guarantor to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, in each of
sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (a), which sale, exchange or transfer is permitted under, and
made in compliance with, the Conditions of Issue;

(b) upon the release of the Guarantee of Indebtedness that resulted in the creation of the relevant
Note Guarantee under the covenant described below under ‘‘—Covenants—Future Guarantors’’
so long as no Event of Default would arise as a result and no other Indebtedness of the Issuer or
any Guarantor at that time is Guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor;

(c) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Notes as provided below under ‘‘—Legal
_Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’;_

(d) upon redemption of all the Notes;

(e) if the Issuer designates a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary as permitted under and in
compliance with the Conditions of Issue;

(f) in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or Security Document;

(g) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described below under ‘‘—Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation’’;_

(h) as provided for under ‘‘—Amendments and Waivers’’; or

(i) as provided for in the Note Guarantees.

No release and discharge of a Note Guarantee pursuant to clauses (b) and (e) above shall be effective (i) if
a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Conditions of Issue as of the
time of such proposed release and discharge until such time as such Default or Event of Default is cured or
waived and (ii) if so requested by the Security Agent, until the Issuer shall have delivered to the Security
Agent (x) an Officers’ Request Certificate and (y) Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent set forth in the Conditions of Issue have been fulfilled and that such release and discharge is
authorized and permitted pursuant to the Conditions of Issue. The Security Agent shall be entitled to
accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of such conditions precedent, in
which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Note Guarantee, as specified above, the Security Agent,
subject to receipt of certain documents from the Issuer or a Guarantor, will take all necessary action and
execute any documents, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably required in order to evidence such release, discharge
and termination in respect of any Note Guarantee to be released as described above. Neither the Issuer
nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect any such release, discharge
or termination.

215


-----

**Restricted Subsidiaries**

All of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer are ‘‘Restricted Subsidiaries’’. However, under the circumstances
described below under ‘‘—Covenants—Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’, the Issuer will be permitted
to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be
subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Conditions of Issue and will not guarantee the Notes.

**Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Holders’ Representative**

The Issuer will maintain for the Notes a Paying Agent (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’), a Transfer Agent (the
‘‘Transfer Agent’’) and a Notification Agent (‘‘Notification Agent’’) for communication by the Holders’
Representative. The initial Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Notification Agent is Deutsche Bank AG.

The Issuer may appoint additional paying agents and transfer agents and revoke the appointment of any
paying agent or transfer agent; _provided, however, that (i) for as long as the Notes are listed on a stock_
exchange, the Issuer shall at all times ensure that a paying agent is appointed in the jurisdiction in which
such stock exchange is located, if so required by the rules of such stock exchange and (ii) in no event may
the Issuer act as Paying Agent or appoint a Paying Agent in any member state of the European Union
where the Paying Agent would be obliged to withhold or deduct tax in connection with any payment made
by it in relation to the Notes unless the Paying Agent would be so obliged if it were located in all other
member states. Any such appointment or revocation shall be published without undue delay in accordance
with the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Notices’’.

The Paying Agent and the Transfer Agent reserve the right at any time to change their specified offices.
Any such change shall be published without undue delay in accordance with procedures set forth under
‘‘—Notices’’.

The common representative (the ‘‘Holders’ Representative’’) to exercise the Holders’ rights on behalf of
the Holders as provided for in the Conditions of Issue is Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr¨ufungsgesellschaft,
Schwannstrasse 6, 40476 D¨usseldorf, Germany. The Holders’ Representative has the duties and powers
provided for in the Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement, by law or granted by resolution of
the Holders. The Holders’ Representative shall comply with the instructions of the Holders. To the extent
that the Holders’ Representative has been authorized to assert certain rights of the Holders, the Holders
shall not be entitled to assert such rights themselves, unless explicitly provided for in the relevant
resolution or the Conditions of Issue. The Holders’ Representative shall provide reports to the Holders on
its activities. The provisions of the German Act on Debt Securities of 2009 (Gesetz ¨uber
_Schuldverschreibungen aus Gesamtemissionen (Schuldverschreibungsgesetz-SchVG), ‘‘SchVG’’) apply with_
regard to the removal of the Holders’ Representative and its rights and obligations. Notwithstanding the
next paragraph below, if the Holders choose to remove the Holders’ Representative or if the Holders’
Representative resigns and the Holders fail to appoint a successor Holders’ Representative, the exercise of
certain rights under the Conditions of Issue may require a meeting of the Holders and may be significantly
more difficult to exercise.

The Holders’ Representative may be removed from office at any time by majority resolution of the Holders
without specifying any reasons; provided that the Holders shall only so remove the Holders’ Representative
if, at the same time, a successor Holders’ Representative for the Notes is elected by the majority resolution
of the Holders. The Holders’ Representative may resign at any time by notifying the Issuer (in which case
the Issuer shall notify the Holders in accordance with the notice provisions). If the Holders’ Representative
resigns, it shall call a vote without undue delay to elect a successor Holders’ Representative. Any successor
Holders’ Representative shall also succeed the retiring Holders’ Representative as a party to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders’ Representative will be liable for the proper performance of its duties towards the Holders
who will be joint and several creditors (Gesamtgl¨aubiger); in the performance of its duties it shall act with
the diligence and care of a prudent business manager (ordentlicher und gewissenhafter Gesch¨aftsleiter within
the meaning of Section 7(3) SchVG). The total liability of the Holders’ Representative to all Holders will
be limited to A5,000,000 (or, if higher, an amount equal to ten times the Holders’ Representative’s
aggregate annual compensation for its services as common representative of the Holders) in the aggregate,
unless the Holders’ Representative’s liability has been caused by its gross negligence (grobe Fahrl¨assigkeit)
or willful misconduct (Vorsatz) (in which case its liability shall be unlimited). The responsibilities and
liability of the Holders’ Representative is further limited as specified in the Conditions of Issue and may be
further limited by a resolution passed by Holders.

216


-----

The Holders’ Representative shall not under any circumstances be liable for any consequential loss. The
Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to retain third party advisors if such appointment is, in its sole
reasonable discretion, required in, or for the performance of, its duties and the Issuer will bear such costs.
The Holders’ Representative shall only be responsible for the proper selection of such third-party advisor
(Auswahlverschulden), but shall otherwise be entitled to rely fully on the advice rendered by such third
party advisor. In particular, the Holders’ Representative is not responsible for the selection of the Security
Agent and will have no responsibility towards the Holders or any other party for the validity, perfection,
sufficiency, adequacy, insuring of, priority or enforceability of any Note Guarantee, Collateral,
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, regardless of whether entered in
before or after the Issue Date.

The Holders’ Representative may demand from the Issuer to furnish all information required for the
performance of the duties entrusted to it.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer or, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Note Guarantee, any
present or future Guarantor or any successor of any of the foregoing (each a ‘‘Payor’’) under or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee shall be made free and clear of and without withholding or
deduction for or on account of any Taxes, unless the deduction or withholding of such Taxes is required by
law. If any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed by or on behalf of or levied
within (i) the Federal Republic of Germany, (ii) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the
Notes or a Note Guarantee is made, (iii) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized or otherwise
considered to be resident or conducts business for tax purposes or any (iv) province, municipality or other
political subdivision or taxing authority in or of any such jurisdiction under foregoing (i) through (iii) (any
such jurisdiction under foregoing (i) through (iv) a ‘‘Relevant Tax Jurisdiction’’), will at any time be
required to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, the relevant Payor shall pay (together with such payment)
such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the holders of the
Notes after such withholding or deduction (including any deduction or withholding from such additional
amounts) shall equal the respective amounts of principal and interest that would have been receivable in
respect of the Notes, in the absence of such deduction or withholding (the aggregate of such additional
amounts, ‘‘Additional Amounts’’), except that no such Additional Amounts shall be payable with respect
to:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the Holder or
beneficial owner of a Note (or a fiduciary, settler, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of,
or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or
beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) having, or having had, some personal or business connection with the Relevant Tax
Jurisdiction (other than the mere acquisition, ownership, holding or disposition of such Note, the
enforcement of rights under such Note or under a Note Guarantee, or the receipt of any
payments in respect of such Note or Note Guarantee) and not merely by reason of the fact that
payments in respect of the Notes or any Note Guarantee are, or for purposes of taxation are
deemed to be, derived from sources in, or are secured in, the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction;

(b) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on or with
respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(c) any Taxes imposed on a payment on a Note presented for payment (where presentation is
required for payment) by or on behalf of a Holder who would have been able to avoid such Taxes
by presenting the Note to another Paying Agent in a member state of the European Union;

(d) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(e) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed by reason of the failure of
the Holder, following the Issuer’s written request addressed to the Holder (and made at a time
that would enable the Holder acting reasonably to comply with that request, and in all events, at
least 60 days before any such withholding or deduction would be required), to comply with any
certification, identification, information or other reporting requirements, whether required by
statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction, as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, Taxes

217


-----

imposed by the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the
Holder is not resident in the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction), but in each case, only to the extent the
Holder is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(f) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed under section 1471
through 1474 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as of March 27,
2018 (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially
more onerous to comply with), including any current or future Treasury regulations or other
official interpretations thereunder or any law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental
agreement between a non-U.S. government and the United States with respect to the foregoing;

(g) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are withheld, deducted or imposed on or with respect to any
payments under, or with respect to, the Notes or under or with respect to any Note Guarantee by
reason of the Holder being, or having been a fiduciary or partnership or any person other than
the sole beneficial owner of any such payments to the extent that such Taxes would not have been
imposed or required to be withheld or deducted on such payments had such Holder been the sole
beneficial owner of such Notes; or

(h) any combination of items (a) through (g) above.

In cases where the deduction or withholding of Taxes on or with respect to any payments under or with
respect to the Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee is required by law to be made by a Payor, the
Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from
each Relevant Tax Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will furnish to a Holder upon written request
within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified
copies of tax receipts evidencing payment by the Payor, or if, notwithstanding the Payor’s efforts to obtain
receipts, receipts are not obtained, other reasonably satisfactory evidence of payments by the Payor.

If the Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such
payment, at least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or
any Note Guarantee is due and payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the
30th day prior to such date, in which case it must be promptly thereafter), the Payor will deliver to the
Paying Agent an Officers’ Request Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable, the
amounts estimated to be payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to
inform the relevant Holders of the payment of such Additional Amounts in accordance with the
procedures set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ on the payment date.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise or
property taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction (including penalties,
interest and other liabilities related thereto) which arise from the execution, delivery, issuance or
registration of the Notes or any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein
(other than a transfer of the Notes), or the receipt of any payments with respect to, or enforcement of, the
Notes or any Note Guarantee.

Whenever in the Conditions of Issue or in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any
context, the payment or non-payment of principal, premium or interest, if any, or any other amount
payable under or with respect to any Note or Note Guarantee, such mention shall be deemed to include
mention of the payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts
are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The above obligation will survive any termination or defeasance of the Conditions of Issue, any transfer by
a Holder or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply, mutatis mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any
successor Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized or otherwise considered to be resident or
conducts business for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on the Notes or
any Note Guarantee is made and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Currency Indemnity**

The euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any Guarantors
under or in connection with the Notes. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro
(the ‘‘Required Currency’’), which is made to or for the account of any Holder in lawful currency of any

218


-----

other jurisdiction (the ‘‘Judgment Currency’’), whether as a result of any judgment or order or the
enforcement thereof or the liquidation of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall constitute a discharge of the
Issuer or the Guarantor’s obligation under the Conditions of Issue and the Notes or Note Guarantee, as
the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency with such Holder, as the case
may be, could purchase in the London foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Judgment
Currency in accordance with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first
Business Day following receipt of the payment in the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Required
Currency that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the Required Currency originally due to
such Holder, as the case may be, the Issuer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Holder, as the case may
be, from and against all loss or damage arising out of, or as a result of, such deficiency. This indemnity shall
constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in the Conditions
of Issue and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any
indulgence granted by any Holder from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or
under any judgment or order.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to March 31, 2021, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 35% of
the original principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional
Notes) with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of 103.000% of
the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the applicable redemption date (subject to the rights of Holders to receive interest on the
relevant interest payment date); provided, however, that:

(i) at least 65% of the original principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving effect to any
issuance of additional Notes) remains outstanding after each such redemption; and

(ii) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering upon not less than
30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice.

At any time prior to March 31, 2021, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part of
the Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date (subject to the
rights of Holders to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date).

Except pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs and except pursuant to ‘‘—Early Redemption for Taxation
_Reasons’’, the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s option prior to March 31, 2021._

At any time on or after March 31, 2021, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a part
of the Notes, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month
period beginning on March 31 of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of Holders to receive
interest on the relevant interest payment date:

2021 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 101.500%

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. If the due date for any
redemption payment in respect of the Note is note a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

**Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers**

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Conditions of Issuer, in connection with any tender offer for, or
other offer to purchase or invitation to offer to purchase, the Notes, including a Change of Control Offer
(as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below) (each, a ‘‘Tender Offer’’), if Holders of
not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender (or offer
to purchase) and do not validly withdraw (or revoke their offer to purchase) such Notes in such Tender

219


-----

Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such Tender Offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered (or offered to purchase) and not validly withdrawn (or such offer to purchase not
having been validly revoked) by such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, given not more than 30 days following the expiration date of the
relevant Tender Offer, to redeem all remaining Notes at a price equal to the price paid to each other
Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such Tender Offer, plus, to the extent not included
in the Tender Offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to but
excluding the applicable redemption date.

**Early Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

If (i) the Issuer becomes obligated to pay Additional Amounts as set forth under ‘‘—Payment of Additional
_Amounts’’ above, (ii) such obligation cannot be avoided by the taking of reasonable measures available to_
the Issuer and (iii) the requirement arises as a result of:

(a) any change in or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction which change or amendment has not been publicly
announced as formally proposed before, and which becomes effective on or after, the Issue Date
or, if a Relevant Tax Jurisdiction has changed since the Issue Date, the date on which such
Relevant Tax Jurisdiction became an applicable Relevant Tax Jurisdiction pursuant to the
Conditions of Issue (the ‘‘Relevant Tax Jurisdiction Date’’); or

(b) any change in, or amendment to, the existing official position or the introduction of an official
position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published practice), which change, amendment, application or
interpretation has not been publicly announced as formally proposed before, and becomes
effective on or after, the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction Date,

the Notes may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at the option of the Issuer, upon not less than
10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior notice of redemption at 100% of the outstanding principal amount
thereof together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a
‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) and Additional Amounts, if any, then due and that will become due on the Tax
Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of Holders to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date and Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof).

Prior to giving any notice of redemption pursuant to this provision, the Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’
Representative for delivery to the Holders in accordance with ‘‘—Notices’’ (i) an Officers’ Request
Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts
showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have occurred and (ii) an
Opinion of Counsel qualified under the laws of the Relevant Tax Jurisdiction to the effect that there has
been such change or amendment which would entitle the Issuer to redeem the Notes hereunder. The
Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of such conditions precedent, in which event it shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

No notice of redemption pursuant to this provision may be given (i) earlier than 60 days prior to the
earliest date on which the Issuer would be obligated to pay such Additional Amounts were a payment in
respect of the Notes then due, or (ii) if at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts does not remain in effect.

**Procedures of Redemption**

Any notice of redemption shall be given in accordance with the procedures set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’. It shall
be irrevocable, must specify the amount of redemption, the terms and date fixed for redemption and must
set forth a statement in summary form of the facts constituting the basis for the right of the Issuer so to
redeem the Notes.

In the case of a partial redemption of the Notes, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected in accordance
with the rules of the relevant clearing system. Such partial redemption shall be reflected in the records of
Clearstream Banking as either a pool factor or a reduction in aggregate principal amount.

220


-----

The Issuer may acquire Notes by means other than a redemption, whether by tender offer, open market
purchase, negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with applicable laws, as long as such
transaction does not otherwise violate the Conditions of Issue.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder shall have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or
any part (equal to A100,000 or an integral multiple of A1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the applicable purchase date (the ‘‘Change of Control Purchase Price’’),
subject to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date.

No later than 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer shall give notice in accordance with the
procedures set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ below, with a copy to the Holders’ Representative, stating:

(a) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that each Holder has the right to require
the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at the Change of Control Purchase Price (the
‘‘Change of Control Payment’’);

(b) the repurchase date (the repurchase date so stated the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’),
which date shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is
given;

(c) the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Conditions of Issue, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased;

(d) that, if such notice is given prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Change of Control
Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control;

(e) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control;

(f) that any Note accepted for Change of Control Payment will cease to accrue interest after the
Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Purchase Price is not paid; and

(g) that any Note (or part thereof) not tendered will continue to accrue interest (the offer so being
made the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’).

The Issuer shall not be required to make the Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a
third party makes an offer in a manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Conditions of Issue applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of
redemption has been given pursuant to the Conditions of Issue as described above under ‘‘—Optional
_Redemption’’, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price._
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is
made.

The Issuer shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer or any offer made in lieu
thereof in accordance with the procedures set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’ on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Payment Date.

Except as otherwise set forth under this heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of
_Control’’, the Conditions of Issue do not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the_
Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction
that may adversely affect the Holders if such transaction does not constitute a Change of Control. The
Change of Control provisions described under this heading ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a
_Change of Control’’ may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other takeover attempts involving the_
Issuer by increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions.

221


-----

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection
with the repurchase of Notes. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with provisions of the Conditions of Issue, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control
provisions of the Conditions of Issue by virtue of the conflict.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the properties or assets of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable German law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder to require the Issuer to repurchase its
Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will have sufficient funds
or other resources to pay the Change of Control Payment for all the Notes that might be delivered by
Holders thereof seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer, see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes—We may not be able to repay the Notes when due or to repurchase the Notes when we are required to do_
_so pursuant to certain events constituting a change of control or otherwise, and the change of control provision_
_contained in the Conditions of Issue may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important_
_corporate events’’._

**Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur
any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any_
Guarantor may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if (i) on the date thereof and after

payment required to be made under such currency agreement and, otherwise, the Euro
Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time
due and payable but is not covered by such currency agreement; and

that:

(A) such Euro Equivalent was determined based on an agreement intended to protect against
fluctuations in currency exchange rates, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be
determined in accordance with sub-clause (B) of clause (v) above; and

(B) the principal amount of the Refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Euro Equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such Refinancing Indebtedness is being Incurred.

where, in the case of this clause (ii), either (x) the Issuer determines when such Indebtedness is
Incurred that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect,
the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes as and when they come
due or (y) the Issuer determines that such encumbrances and restrictions apply only during the
continuance of a default in respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to
such Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(i) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at least equal to the Fair Market
Value (such Fair Market Value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such
Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Issuer (including
as to the value of all non-cash consideration), of the shares and assets subject to such Asset
Disposition;

(ii) in any such Asset Disposition, at least 75% of the consideration is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents. For purposes of this ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’ covenant, each of the
following shall be deemed cash:

(A) any liabilities, as shown on the Issuer’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities, Disqualified Stock and
liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to any agreement that releases the
Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from or indemnifies against further liability;

(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
from such transferee that are converted by the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary
into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Asset Disposition,
to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(C) any Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted
Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(D) consideration consisting of Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary received from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(E) any Designated Non Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non Cash
Consideration received and designated pursuant to this clause (E) that is at any one time
outstanding, not to exceed A15 million (with the Fair Market Value of each item of
Designated Non Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value); and

(iii) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by
the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(A) to the extent the Issuer elects, to prepay, repay or purchase (x) Indebtedness that is secured
by a Permitted Collateral Lien that ranks equal to or in priority to any Lien on such assets
securing the Notes or the Note Guarantees and is _pari passu in right of payment with the_
Notes or the Note Guarantees (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under the Existing

230


-----

Notes, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior Secured Facilities and any
purchase or redemption of any Notes (provided that any such purchase or redemption is at or
above 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of such purchase or redemption)), (y) Indebtedness
which is secured by a Lien (other than a Permitted Collateral Lien) on the asset which is the
subject of the Asset Sale or (z) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or an Affiliate of the Issuer), in each
case, within 395 days from the date of the receipt of such Net Available Cash; _provided,_
however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness
pursuant to this sub-clause (A), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an equal amount to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased;

(B) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with
the foregoing sub-clause (A), to the extent the Issuer elects, to invest in Additional Assets
within 395 days from the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash or pursuant to binding
arrangements in place within such 395 day period; provided that such binding arrangement is
completed within 180 days of such 395 day period;

(C) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with
the foregoing sub-clauses (A) and (B), to the extent the Issuer elects, to make a capital
expenditure within 395 days from the date of receipt of such Net Available Cash or pursuant
to binding arrangements in place within such 395 day period; _provided that such binding_
arrangement is completed within 180 days of such 395 day period; or

(D) to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in accordance with
the foregoing sub-clauses (A) to (C) (the ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’), to make an offer to the
Holders and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness (to the extent the terms of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness so require) on a pro rata basis to purchase the Notes at a purchase price equal
to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to the date of purchase and such Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to and subject to
the Conditions of Issue (an ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’); _provided, however, that in_
connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to the
foregoing sub-clause (A), the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall retire such
Indebtedness and shall cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently
reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchase.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’ covenant, the Issuer or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary shall not be required to apply any Excess Proceeds in accordance with
sub-clause (D) above unless the aggregate Excess Proceeds from all Asset Dispositions which is not applied
in accordance with the foregoing sub-clauses (A) to (C) exceeds A15 million. To the extent that the
aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining
Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the Conditions of
Issue. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer shall accept the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a _pro rata basis of the_
aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness in accordance with the terms
of the Asset Disposition Offer. Upon completion of such Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Asset Disposition Offer will remain open for a period of 20 Business
Days following its commencement, except to the extent that a longer period is required by applicable law
(the ‘‘Asset Disposition Offer Period’’). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset
Disposition Offer Period (the ‘‘Asset Disposition Purchase Date’’), the Issuer will purchase the principal
amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased pursuant to this covenant (the
‘‘Asset Disposition Offer Amount’’) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly
tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has
been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly

231


-----

tendered and not properly withdrawn, in each case with a principal amount of A100,000 or in integral
multiples of A1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business
Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of
Notes or holder or lender of Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, an amount equal to the purchase
price of the Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such
holder or lender, as the case may be, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase. In addition, the Issuer will
take any and all other actions required by the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness. The
Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer on the Asset Disposition Purchase
Date.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into any transaction or series of related transactions (including the rendering of services) with any Affiliate
of the Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions, an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving
aggregate consideration in excess of A5 million unless:

(i) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction
with a Person who is not an Affiliate; and

(ii) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of A10 million,
the terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of
the Board of Directors of the Issuer (and such majority determines that such Affiliate Transaction
satisfies the criteria in clause (i)).

The provisions of the foregoing paragraph shall not apply to:

(i) transactions pursuant to any employee or director compensation arrangements or benefit plans
entered into by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business
of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary;

(ii) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing;

(iii) any Affiliate Transaction between the Issuer and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(iv) any Restricted Payment (other than a Restricted Investment) permitted to be made pursuant to
the provisions set forth under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ above;

(v) the payment of reasonable and customary fees paid to, and indemnity provided on behalf of,
officers, directors or employees of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(vi) the incurrence of Subordinated Shareholder Debt;

(vii) transactions pursuant to, or contemplated, by any agreement in effect on the Issue Date and
transactions pursuant to any amendment (including to change any party to the agreement),
modification or extension to such agreement, so long as such amendment, modification or
extension, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous to the Holders than the original
agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;

(viii)any issuance of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to Affiliates of the
Issuer;

(ix) transactions (x) with the Issuer and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, consistent
with past practice and as otherwise permitted hereunder or (y) for which the Issuer shall have
received a written opinion from an independent investment bank or an accounting or appraisal
firm of internationally recognized standing or other recognized independent expert of
international standing with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of
transaction or series of related transactions for which an opinion is required, stating that such
Affiliate Transaction is (a) fair to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point
of view or (b) not materially less favorable than those that might reasonably have been obtained
in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not an
Affiliate;

232


-----

(x) (x) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or
providers of employees or other labor, in each case in the ordinary course of trading, or (y) any
transaction in the ordinary course of business between the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries and any Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because a director of such
Person is also a director of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, in each case,
_provided (a) such transaction is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Conditions of Issue_
and (b) is on terms at least as favorable as could have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated Person, in the reasonable determination of the members of the Board of Directors or
an Officer of the Issuer _provided such Officer has been delegated such power by the Board of_
Directors in the prior twelve months (provided no member of the Board of Directors or Officer
of the Issuer with an interest in such transaction may participate in such determination); and

(xi) any payments or other transactions pursuant to a tax sharing agreement between or among the
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary and any other Person with which the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries files a consolidated tax return or with which the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries is part of a group for tax purposes or any tax advantageous group
contribution made pursuant to applicable legislation; _provided, however, that such payments or_
transactions will not exceed the lesser of (i) the amount of tax that the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would owe on a stand-alone basis if the Issuer were filing a separate tax return (or a
separate consolidated or combined tax return with its Restricted Subsidiaries that are part of that
consolidated or combined group) and (ii) the related tax liabilities of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries that are relieved thereby.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish in English to the Holders (each with a copy to
the Holders’ Representative) in accordance with clause (ii) of ‘‘—Notices’’:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Issuer’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2018, annual reports containing the following information: (a) audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and

balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most

information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause 2 or 3 below (provided that
such _pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials to the extent available without unreasonable expense)); (c) an
operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the
results of operations (including a discussion by business segment to the extent segment reporting
is required under GAAP), financial condition and liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion
of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) a description of
the business, management and shareholders of the Issuer, material affiliate transactions and
material debt instruments (unless such contractual arrangements were described in a previous
annual or quarterly report, in which case the Issuer need describe only any material changes); and
(e) material risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the
Issuer beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018, quarterly reports containing the

income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since
the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report
relates (provided that such _pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent_
available without unreasonable expense, in which case, the Issuer will provide, in the case of a

233


-----

material acquisition, acquired company financials (to the extent available without unreasonable
expense)); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements (including
a discussion by business segment to the extent segment reporting is required under GAAP),
including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the
Issuer and any material change between the current quarterly period and the corresponding
period of the prior year; and (d) material recent developments; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring of the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any changes of the chief executive
officer, chief financial officer or managing director of the Issuer or change in auditors of the
Issuer or any other material event that the Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a
description of such event;

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above will not be required to_
(i) contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or IFRS or (ii) include
separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-guarantor Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In addition, if the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such
Subsidiaries are Significant Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by
the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP. Except as provided for above, no
report need to include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any
disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a
type included in the offering memorandum relating to the Existing Notes.

In addition, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer has agreed that it will furnish to the
Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required
to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, the
Issuer will also (a) post such report on the Issuer’s website and (b) make available copies of such reports to
the Listing Agent, for the purpose of sending to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (to
the extent required by the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the Holders’ Representative,
the Holders, prospective purchasers and beneficial owners of the Notes if such information referenced
above in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above has been posted on the Issuer’s website.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer shall not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into another Person, or
convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:

(i) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union as of
December 31, 2003, Switzerland, the United States of America or the District of Columbia, and
the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume in appropriate documentation
delivered to the Holders’ Representative all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agency Agreement and the Conditions of
Issue;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result
of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

234


-----

(iii) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and any related financings the Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional A1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to
clause (i)(x) of the first paragraph of the ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ covenant above;

(iv) each Guarantor shall have delivered to the Holders’ Representative a confirmation that its Note
Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations in respect of the Notes and the Agency
Agreement;

(v) if any such transaction results in the Issuer or Successor Company being incorporated in a
jurisdiction other than Germany, the Board of Directors of the Issuer and the Successor
Company will have adopted a resolution stating that the transaction effecting such a change in
jurisdiction was not being entered into for a purpose which included subjecting the Issuer or the
Successor Company, as the case may be, to more favorable bankruptcy, insolvency, laws relating
to creditors rights or similar laws; and

(vi) the Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative an Officers’ Request Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or
lease and such assumption by the Successor Company comply with this covenant and the Opinion
of Counsel shall state in addition that each of the Note Guarantees shall apply to such Person’s
obligations in respect of the Notes and the Agency Agreement to the same or greater extent than
they applied to the Notes and the Agency Agreement immediately prior to such transaction. The
Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient
evidence of compliance with this paragraph and shall not be obligated to independently
investigate whether the requirements of this paragraph are otherwise met.

_Guarantors_

In addition, the Issuer shall not permit any Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to consolidate with or merge
with or into another Person, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all the properties and assets of
such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to
another Person, unless:

(i) either:

(A) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person will be a Person organized and existing under
the laws of any member state of the European Union on 31 December 2003, Switzerland, the
United States of America, the District of Columbia or the jurisdiction in which it was
originally organized, and such Person (if not a Guarantor) will expressly assume in an
appropriate documentation and delivered to the Holders’ Representative, all the obligations
of such Guarantor under its Note Guarantee; or

(B) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of the Guarantor or the conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the
properties and assets of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Conditions of Issue;

(ii) immediately after giving effect to, and as a result of, such transaction no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(iii) in the case of clause (i)(A) above, if any such transaction results in the Guarantor or Successor
Company being incorporated in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which it was
organized as of the Issue Date, the Board of Directors of the Guarantor and the Successor
Company will have adopted a resolution stating that the transaction effecting such a change in
jurisdiction was not being entered into for a purpose which included subjecting the Guarantor or
the Successor Company, as the case may be, to more favorable bankruptcy, insolvency, laws
relating to creditors rights or similar laws; and

(iv) the Issuer and such Guarantor shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative in accordance with
‘‘Notices’’ an Officers’ Request Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that such
consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease and, in the case of clause (i)(A) only, such
assumption by the resulting, surviving or transferee Person comply with this covenant and the
Opinion of Counsel shall state in addition that the Note Guarantee by the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person shall apply to such Person’s obligations in respect of the Notes and the Agency
Agreement to the same or greater extent than they applied to the Notes and the Agency

235


-----

Agreement immediately prior to such transaction. The Holders’ Representative shall be entitled
to accept such Opinion of Counsel as sufficient evidence of compliance with this paragraph and
shall not be obligated to independently investigate whether the requirements of this paragraph
are otherwise met.

The successor to any Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Guarantor under the
applicable Note Guarantee.

This ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant will not apply to (a) any consolidation, merger or transfer of
assets of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor into the Issuer or a Guarantor, (b) any
consolidation, merger or transfer of assets among Guarantors, or (c) any consolidation, merger or transfer
of assets among the Issuer and any Guarantor; provided that, clauses (i) and (vi) of the first paragraph of
this covenant will be complied with. Clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph and clause (ii) of the second
paragraph of this covenant will not apply to any merger or consolidation of the Issuer or any Guarantors
with or into an Affiliate solely for the purpose of reincorporating the Issuer or such Guarantor in another
jurisdiction.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and the
rules of the International Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notice of the occurrence of
any of the events described in this ‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant in accordance with the
prevailing rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited.

**_Future Guarantors_**

The Issuer shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor and that, (a) after the Issue Date,
Guarantees any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor or (b) is a Significant Subsidiary, to execute
and deliver concurrently to the Holders’ Representative a Note Guarantee pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Notes, which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari
_passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness._

Any such Restricted Subsidiary will, simultaneously with the execution of such Note Guarantee, pledge its
existing and future assets to the extent such assets secure the obligations under the Super Senior Revolving
Credit Facility (in particular, subject to the Agreed Security Principles as set forth therein) to secure the
Notes and its Note Guarantee, and the Issuer will cause all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted
Subsidiary owned by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to be pledged to secure the Notes and the
Note Guarantees.

Each Additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors (including those that relate to general statutory limitations, capital maintenance,
corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, financial assistance or thin-capitalisation rules or other similar
laws or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction). See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes—Each Guarantee and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement_
_and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and_
_enforceability’’ and ‘‘Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability_
_of the Guarantees and Security Interests’’._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to
Guarantee the Notes to the extent that such Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary would
reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in a violation of applicable law which, in any case, cannot be
prevented or otherwise avoided through measures reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted
Subsidiary (including ‘‘whitewash’’ or similar procedures) or any liability for the officers, directors or
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary.

**_Limitation on Lines of Business_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than a
Related Business, except as would not be material to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

**_Maintenance of Listing_**

The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on
the International Stock Exchange for so long as any Notes are outstanding; _provided that if the Issuer is_

236


-----

unable to obtain admission to such listing or if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain
such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of the Notes on
another recognized stock exchange for high yield issuers (which may be another stock exchange that is not
regulated by the European Union).

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, pay
or cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any
consent or vote with respect to any waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the
Conditions of Issue, the Notes, the Agency Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Note Guarantee unless (and to the extent such offer or payment is not prohibited by
applicable law) such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders that consent, waive or
agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or
amendment.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or
payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the
terms or provisions of the Conditions of Issue, to exclude the Holders in any jurisdiction where (A)(i) the
solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for
cash, or (ii) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities
laws (including, but not limited to, the U.S. federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or
its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be
materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent
document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof with
the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction) or (B) such solicitation would otherwise
not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

As of the issue date of the Additional Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries shall be Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the Issuer (including any newly
acquired or newly formed Subsidiary or a Person becoming a Subsidiary through merger, consolidation or
other business combination transaction, or Investment therein) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary only if:

(i) such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries does not own any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of or
have any Investment in, or own or hold any Lien on any property of, any other Subsidiary of the
Issuer which is not a Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated or otherwise an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(ii) no Indebtedness of such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries shall, at the date of designation, or
at any time thereafter, constitute Indebtedness pursuant to which the lender has recourse to any
of the assets of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(iii) such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary
has any direct or indirect obligation to:

(A) subscribe for additional Capital Stock of such Person; or

(B) maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or cause such person to achieve any
specified levels of operating results;

(iv) all outstanding Investments by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent
repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments in an amount
which shall be the Restricted Payment’s Fair Market Value at the time of such transfer and a
Restricted Payment in such amount would be permitted at such time under the covenant set forth
under ‘‘—Limitations on Restricted Payments’’ or the definition of ‘‘Permitted Investments’’ and if
such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’; and

(v) after giving effect to, and as a result of, such designation there will be no Default or Event of
Default.

The Board of Directors of the Issuer may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted
Subsidiary; provided, however, that such designation shall be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness
by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary and such
designation shall be permitted only if (i) immediately after giving effect to such designation, no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the Issuer could Incur at least A1.00 of
additional Indebtedness as described in clause (i)(x) of the first paragraph under ‘‘—Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness’’, on a pro forma basis taking into account such designation as if it had occurred_
at the beginning of the applicable reference period.

Any such designation by the Board of Directors of the Issuer shall be evidenced to the Holders’
Representative by filing with the Holders’ Representative a resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Issuer giving effect to such designation and an Officers’ Request Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the foregoing conditions. The Holders’ Representative shall forward such
resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer and the Officers’ Request Certificate to the Holders in
accordance with the procedures set forth in ‘‘—Notices’’.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take, any action which action or omission might or would have the result of materially
impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of
Liens on the Collateral permitted by the definition of ‘‘Permitted Collateral Liens’’ shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the Collateral) for the
benefit of the Holders’ Representative and the Holders, and the Issuer will not, and will not cause or
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the
benefit of the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral; provided that

(i) nothing in this provision shall restrict the discharge or release of the Collateral in accordance
with the Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents; and

(ii) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens; and _provided_
further, however, that no Security Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with such
amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement, modification or renewal, the
Issuer delivers to the Security Agent either:

(A) a solvency opinion from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
standing confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement;

(B) a certificate from the chief executive officer, chief financial officer or the Board of Directors
of the relevant Person, which confirms the solvency of the person granting Security Interest
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement; or

(C) an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes
created under the Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, modified or replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to
any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, and that such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph which shall not apply to the actions described in this paragraph,
at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of any Holder or the Holders’ Representative, the
Security Agent may from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Security Documents to:
(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens
to the extent permitted by the Conditions of Issue; (iii) add to the Collateral; (iv) comply with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (v) evidence the succession of
another Person to the Issuer and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under the Conditions

238


-----

of Issue, the Notes and the Security Documents, in each case, in accordance with ‘‘—Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation’’; (vi) provide for the release of property and assets constituting Collateral from the Lien_
of the Security Documents or the release of a Note Guarantee granted by a Guarantor, in each case, in
accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the Conditions of Issue and the Intercreditor
Agreement; (vii) conform the Security Documents to this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’; (viii) evidence and
provide for the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Holders’ Representative or Security Agent;
or (ix) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the Holders in any
material respect.

In the event that the Issuer complies with this covenant, the Holders’ Representative and the Security
Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement with no need for instructions
from Holders.

**_Security_**

The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each Guarantor shall, at its own expense, execute and do all such
acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Agent may reasonably require

(i) for registering any Security Documents in any required register and for perfecting or protecting
the security intended to be afforded by such Security Documents; and

(ii) if such Security Documents have become enforceable, for facilitating the realization of all or any
part of the assets which are subject to such Security Documents and for facilitating the exercise of
all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security Agent or in any receiver of all or any
part of those assets. The Issuer shall, and shall procure that each Guarantor shall, execute all
transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property whether to the Security Agent
or to its nominees and give all notices, orders and directions which the Security Agent may
reasonably request.

**_Amendment and Restatement of Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

Furthermore, at the request of the Issuer, at the time of, or prior to, the Incurrence of any Indebtedness
that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantors, the Holders’ Representative
the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility Lenders, the Senior Secured Facility Lenders and/or their
respective agents and the Security Agent shall enter into an additional intercreditor agreement (each an
‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) on terms substantially similar to the Intercreditor Agreement (or not
materially less favorable to the Holders) or an amendment to, or an amendment and restatement of, the
Intercreditor Agreement (which amendment is not materially less favorable to the Holders); provided that
such Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal
obligations on the Holders’ Representative or the Security Agent or adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities or immunities of the Holders’ Representative under the Conditions of Issue or the Intercreditor
Agreement; _provided further that it is understood and agreed that an increase in the amount of_
Indebtedness being subjected to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will be deemed to be on substantially similar terms to the Intercreditor Agreement and will be
deemed not to adversely affect the rights of the Holders and will be permitted by this covenant if, in each
case, the incurrence of such Indebtedness (and any Lien in its favor), would not be otherwise prohibited by
the Conditions of Issue.

The Conditions of Issue will also provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the
Holders’ Representative, the Security Agent or any Holder, the Holders’ Representative and the Security
Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or
inconsistency of any such agreement; (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such
agreement that may be incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to
the Notes); (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries or Guarantors to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; (4) further secure the Notes (including any additional Notes); (5) make
provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure additional Pari Passu Debt (including
additional Notes); (6) implement any Permitted Liens and Permitted Collateral Liens; (7) amend the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof;

239


-----

(8) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to (i) remove any
references to any instruments governing any existing Pari Passu Debt (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) following the full redemption or repayment of such Pari Passu Debt and the cancellation or
termination of the relevant instruments, as applicable and/or (ii) replace any such references with
references to any new instruments governing any new Pari Passu Debt that replaces and/or refinances any
existing Pari Passu Debt, in each case in accordance with the Conditions of Issue; or (9) make any other
change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect.

Save as may be required by mandatory provisions of law, each Holder, by accepting a Note, will be deemed
to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of each Intercreditor Agreement and Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and any amendment referred to in the preceding paragraphs as well as have
authorized the Holders’ Representative to enter into a creditor/creditor representative accession
agreement as contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement and, the Holders’ Representative or the
Security Agent shall not be required to seek the consent of any Holders to perform its obligations under
and in accordance with this covenant. Before entering into an Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
effecting any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to this covenant, the Holders’
Representative or the Security Agent may elect to base its decision on an Officers’ Request Certificate or
an Opinion of Counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holders’ Representative or the
Security Agent, as applicable. Neither the Holders’ Representative nor the Security Agent shall be liable
for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance on such Officers’ Request Certificate or
Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall notify the Holders of the entry of an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or any amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement effected pursuant to this covenant without
undue delay in accordance with procedures set forth in the Condition of Issue.

**_Suspension of Covenants_**

If on any date following the date of the Conditions of Issue:

(i) the Notes are rated with an Investment Grade Rating by both Rating Agencies; and

(ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Conditions of Issue (the foregoing
conditions being referred to collectively as the ‘‘Suspension Condition’’);

then, beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants
specifically listed under the following captions in this ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ (collectively, the
‘‘Suspended Covenants’’) of the Conditions of Issue will be suspended as to the Notes:

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Lines of Business’’;

  - ‘‘—Future Guarantors’’; and

  - clauses (ii) and (iii) of the first paragraph and (ii) of the second paragraph, respectively, of
‘‘—Merger and Consolidation’’.

During any period that the foregoing sections have been suspended, the Issuer’s Board of Directors may
not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to ‘‘—Covenants—Restricted and
_Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’ unless the designation would have complied with the covenant described under_
‘‘—Covenants—Limitations on Restricted Payments’’.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the
Suspended Covenants with respect to the Notes for any period of time as a result of the Suspension
Condition having been met and, subsequently, one or both Rating Agencies withdraw their Investment
Grade Rating or downgrade the Investment Grade Rating assigned to the Notes such that the Notes no
longer have an Investment Grade Rating by both Rating Agencies, then the Issuer and each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants. (a) Compliance with
the Suspended Covenants with respect to Restricted Payments made after the time of such withdrawal or

240


-----

downgrade (i) will be calculated in accordance with the terms of the reinstated ‘‘—Covenants—Limitations
_on Restricted Payments’’ covenant as if the provisions had been in effect since the Issue Date (accordingly,_
Restricted Payments made during such period when the Suspended Covenants are suspended will reduce
the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments described under the first paragraph of
‘‘—Covenants—Limitations on Restricted Payments’’) and (ii) will be calculated in accordance with the
terms of the reinstated ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ covenant as if any Indebtedness
incurred on or after the occurrence of the Suspension Condition will be deemed to have been incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph described under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’; and (b) the
Issuer will, and will cause each Restricted Subsidiary that would have been required to Guarantee the
Notes pursuant to ‘‘—Covenants—Future Guarantors’’ during such period when the Suspended Covenants
are suspended to take all actions it would have been required to take to comply with ‘‘—Covenants—Future
_Guarantors’’ if it had not been suspended including executing a Note Guarantee and pledging the_
Restricted Subsidiary’s existing and future assets and pledging all of the Capital Stock in such Restricted
Subsidiary to secure the Notes and the Guarantees; provided, further, that no Default, Event of Default or
breach of any kind will be deemed to exist under the Conditions of Issue with respect to the Suspended
Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries will bear any liability for, any actions
taken or events occurring after such Notes attain the required ratings and before any reinstatement of the
Suspended Covenants as provided above, or any actions, taken at any time pursuant to any contractual
obligations arising prior to the reinstatement of the Suspended Covenants, regardless of whether those
actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable sections had remained in effect during such
period.

**_Financial Calculations_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Conditions of Issue in connection
with any future paper machine project (including with regard to the Incurrence of any related
Indebtedness or the making of any related Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments, as the case
may be), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at
the option of the Issuer, be the Commitment Date (as defined below) with regard to any such paper
machine project for purposes of determining the ability to Incur any related Indebtedness or make any
related Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments (in each case, as set forth in the then-current
budget for such paper machine project prepared in good faith by an Officer of the Issuer and approved by
the Board of Directors of the Issuer) after the Commitment Date (and not for purposes of any subsequent
availability of any basket or ratio), and, for the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are
exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio or any component thereof (including due to
fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the
Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or the making of any related Restricted Payments and/or Permitted
Investments, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Incurrence of any such related Indebtedness or
the making of any such Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments are permitted hereunder and
(y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time any such related Indebtedness is actually Incurred
or any such Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments are actually made; provided further, that if the
Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the Commitment Date, the Incurrence of any related
Indebtedness or the making of any related Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments shall be
deemed to have occurred on the Commitment Date and any such Indebtedness shall be deemed to be
outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Conditions of Issue after
the Commitment Date and before the earlier of (i) the actual Incurrence of any related Indebtedness or
the actual making of any related Restricted Payments and/or Permitted Investments, as applicable and
(ii) the date on which the Issuer determines that the relevant paper machine project has been completed or
abandoned (as set forth in an Officers’ Request Certificate). ‘‘Commitment Date’’ with regard to any paper
machine project for the purpose of this covenant shall mean the date specified as such in a resolution of
the Board of Directors of the Issuer; provided that the Issuer and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries, on the
date of such resolutions, reasonably expects to enter, within three months of the date of such resolution,
into one or more definitive agreements with one or more third parties with regard to the realization of the
relevant paper machine project with an aggregate value of no less than A50 million.

**Events of Default, Enforcement**

Each of the following constitutes an ‘‘Event of Default’’ under the Conditions of Issue:

(a) default in any payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(b) default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, on any Note when due and payable at
its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon acceleration or
otherwise;

(c) failure by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to comply with any obligation under the covenant
set forth under ‘‘—Covenants—Merger and Consolidation’’, ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of
_Holders upon a Change of Control’’, or ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets’’, continued_
for 30 days, other than a failure to purchase Notes which shall constitute an Event of Default
under the foregoing clause (b);

(d) failure by the Issuer or any of the Guarantors to comply for 60 days after notice from the
Holders’ Representative (upon instruction by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding) with its other obligations contained in the Conditions of
Issue;

(e) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for borrowed money by the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the
Conditions of Issue, which default:

(i) is caused by a failure to pay when due principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such
Indebtedness prior to the expiration of any applicable grace period provided for under the
terms of such Indebtedness (‘‘payment default’’); or

(ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated aggregates A40 million or more;

(f) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization under bankruptcy laws of (i) the Issuer,
(ii) a Guarantor or (iii) a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary;

(g) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of
A10 million (net of any amounts that are covered by insurance policies issued by reputable and
creditworthy insurance companies), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a
period of 60 days after the judgment exceeding such threshold becomes final;

(h) any Note Guarantee of any Guarantor that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full
force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Conditions
of Issue or as provided under applicable law) or is declared null and void in a judicial proceeding
or the Issuer or any such Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing or in any pleading in any court
its obligations under the Conditions of Issue or its Note Guarantee and any such Default
continues for ten days; or

(i) with respect to any Collateral having a Fair Market Value in excess of A20 million, individually or
in the aggregate, (i) (a) the security interest under the Conditions of Issue or the Security
Documents, at any time, ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason other than in
accordance with the terms of the Security Documents and other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Notes or (b) any security interest created thereunder or under the Security
Documents is declared invalid or unenforceable and such Default continues for 15 days after the
Issuer becomes aware of the Default or (ii) the Issuer or any Guarantor asserts that any such
security interest or Security Document is invalid or unenforceable prior to the time that the
Collateral is to be released to the Issuer or the Guarantors.

242


-----

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default pursuant to the foregoing clause (f)) occurs and is
continuing, the Holders’ Representative upon instruction of Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
all outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuer shall terminate the Notes and declare the principal amount of
and all accrued interest under all outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately. If an Event of
Default with respect to the Issuer pursuant to the foregoing clause (f) occurs and is continuing, the Notes
will automatically be terminated and all payments under the Notes will become due and payable
immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Holders’ Representative or any Holder.
Certain enforcement actions, including acceleration, will be suspended during a consultation period under
the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement’’._

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default pursuant to
foregoing clause (e) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the relevant default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to the foregoing
clause (e) shall be remedied or cured by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or waived by the holders of
the relevant Indebtedness, or the relevant Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, within 20 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(i) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal,
premium, or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have
been cured or waived.

The Holders may rescind any acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences within three
months of the acceleration by simple majority vote of the Holders if such rescission would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the aggregate of such
cast votes exceeds the number of votes having required the acceleration.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an ‘‘Initial Default’’), then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial
Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the
failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in ‘‘—Covenants—Reports’’, or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Conditions of Issue shall be deemed to be cured
upon delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Conditions of Issue.

Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Conditions of Issue or the Notes unless:

(a) such Holder has previously given the Holders’ Representative notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(b) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the
Holders’ Representative to pursue the remedy;

(c) the Holders’ Representative has not complied with such request within 60 days following the
receipt of the request; and

(d) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not within such
60 day period given the Holders’ Representative a direction that, in the opinion of the Holders’
Representative, is inconsistent with such request.

Subject to the Conditions of Issue and applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for any remedy available to the Holders’ Representative or of exercising any trust or power
conferred on the Holders’ Representative.

The Issuer shall deliver to the Holders’ Representative for delivery to the Holders in accordance with
procedures set forth in the Condition of Issue, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (and within
20 Business Days upon request at any time after the 120 days), an Officers’ Request Certificate stating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer also is
required to deliver to the Holders’ Representative, after becoming aware of the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute Defaults, their status and what
action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

243


-----

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Holders’ Representative may or, subject to the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to any Note Guarantee and the Collateral, the
Security Agent may:

(a) in its sole discretion, but shall not be required to, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the
Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Holders’ Representative or the Security
Agent, as applicable, shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether
for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in the Conditions of Issue or any Note
Guarantee or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper
remedy, including making demand under one or more of the Note Guarantees on behalf of the
Holders; and

(b) prosecute and enforce all rights of action and claims under the Conditions of Issue or any Note
Guarantee without the possession of any of the Notes or the Global Notes or the production
thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and to bring any such proceeding on behalf of the
Holders.

**Amendments and Waivers**

In accordance with the German Act on Debt Securities of 2009 (Gesetz ¨uber Schuldverschreibungen aus
_Gesamtemissionen (Schuldverschreibungsgesetz-SchVG)) the Holders may, by resolution with the majority_
specified in the following paragraph below, (i) agree with the Issuer on amendments to the Conditions of
Issue, with regard to matters permitted by the SchVG, (ii) consent to such amendments of the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Guarantees and the Security Documents which require such consent by the
Holders, (iii) alter the powers and duties of, and give instructions and consents to, the Holders’
Representative to the extent the Holders’ Representative has the right but not the obligation to accept
such additional powers and duties and (iv) appoint, and revoke the appointment of any Holders’
Representative. Majority resolutions shall be binding on all Holders. Resolutions which do not provide for
identical conditions for all Holders are void, unless Holders who are disadvantaged have expressly
consented to their being treated disadvantageously.

Unless a higher majority is required under mandatory provisions of statutory law, resolutions shall be
passed by a majority of the Holders of not less than 50% plus one vote of the votes cast (including, votes
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes); _provided, however, that_
resolutions regarding:

(i) any reduction of the relevant premium to be paid upon repurchase of any Notes or any change in
the time at which any Note is to be repurchased pursuant to the provision described under
‘‘—Optional Redemption’’ and under ‘‘—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of
_Control’’;_

(ii) any amendment or termination of any of the Security Documents (other than amendments
provided for in the Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents);

(iii) any change of the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any instalment of interest on, or change
to an earlier redemption date of, or waiver of a default in the payment of principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on, any Notes (except a rescission or acceleration of the Notes by simple
majority resolution of the meeting of the Holders and a waiver of the Payment Default that
resulted from such acceleration) or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest
thereon, or change the coin or currency in which the principal of any such Note or any premium
or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any
such payment after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the
redemption date);

(iv) any reduction in the principal amount of outstanding Notes whose holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

(v) the modification of any of the provisions relating to amendments requiring the consent of holders
or relating to the waiver of past defaults or the waiver of covenants, except to increase the
percentage of outstanding Notes required for such actions;

(vi) the release of any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee except in accordance
with the Conditions of Issue, such Note Guarantee and the Intercreditor Agreement; and

244


-----

(vii) any change to the preceding amendment and waiver provisions;

shall require the consent of not less than 90% of the votes cast (including, consents obtained in connection
with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes); provided further that any amendments regarding the
form, custody and clearing, and transferability of the Notes, the book-entry register, payment conditions
and the enforcement of rights as set forth in the Conditions of Issue require approval of 100% of the
Holders.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is not necessary for the Holders to consent to the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if the Holders consent to the substance of any proposed amendment.

The Conditions of Issue or the Intercreditor Agreement may be amended or supplemented without the
consent of any Holder:

(i) to cure any ambiguity, to correct any error which is of formal, minor or technical nature, or to
correct or supplement any provision in the Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement or
the Procedural Rules that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision in the
Conditions of Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Procedural Rules; provided that, in each
case, such provisions shall not adversely affect the interests of the Holders;

(ii) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s obligations under the Conditions of
Issue, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Procedural Rules in the case of a merger or other
amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s assets, as the
case may be; provided that such merger, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all assets is
not prohibited by the Conditions of Issue or any Guarantee;

(iii) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders;

(iv) to add additional Guarantees, or to release Guarantors from Guarantees in accordance with and
if permitted by the terms of the Conditions of Issue;

(v) to further secure the Notes, or to release all or any portion of the Collateral in accordance with
and if permitted by the terms of the Conditions of Issue;

(vi) to enter into an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or to amend the Intercreditor Agreement,
as contemplated under ‘‘—Covenants—Amendment and Restatement of Intercreditor Agreement;
_Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’; or_

(vii) to provide for the issuance of additional Notes as contemplated under ‘‘—General—Additional
_Notes’’ and if permitted by the terms and limitations of the Conditions of Issue._

Holders shall pass resolutions by vote taken without a meeting in accordance with the Procedural Rules,
unless the Holders’ Representative or Holders representing in the aggregate at least 5% of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding expressly request that a meeting of Holders takes place. The vote
shall be chaired by a notary appointed by the Issuer or, if the Holders’ Representative has convened the
vote, by the Holders’ Representative.

Each Holder participating in any vote shall cast votes in accordance with the nominal amount or the
notional share of its entitlement to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes.

Exercise of voting rights in a vote without meeting is subject to the Holders registration. Registration must
be received at the address stated in the request for voting by no later than the third day preceding the
voting period.

Attendance at a meeting and exercise of voting rights is subject to the Holders registration. Registration
must be received at the address stated in the convening notice by no later than the third day preceding the

**Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance**

The Conditions of Issue will provide that the Issuer may, as evidenced by a resolution set forth in an
Officers’ Request Certificate, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged
with respect to the outstanding Notes and the Guarantees (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’). Legal Defeasance means
that the Issuer will be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the
outstanding Notes that are being defeased and Note Guarantees except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust account
referred to below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to exchange any Notes, replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes,
maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of the Notes and segregate and hold such
payments in trust;

(c) the rights and obligations of the Holders’ Representative and the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the ‘‘Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance’’ provisions of the Conditions of Issue.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Conditions of Issue (‘‘Covenant
**Defeasance’’), and thereafter any omission to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or**
an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events
described under ‘‘—Events of Default, Enforcement’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. These events do not include events relating to non-payment or, solely with respect to
the Issuer, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may exercise its Legal
Defeasance option regardless of whether they previously exercised Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(i) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited in a trust account for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes, cash in euro, non-callable European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof, in each case in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of the
Issuer (acting in good faith), to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest,
on the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the
case may be, and the Issuer must (x) prior to depositing such monies or securities to the trust
account, procure an Opinion of Counsel stating, subject to customary assumptions and
qualifications, that the trust account will be bankruptcy remote; (y) specify whether the Notes are
being defeased to such Stated Maturity or to a particular redemption date; and (z) if applicable,
have delivered to the Holders’ Representative an irrevocable notice to redeem all the outstanding
Notes of such principal, premium, if any, or interest;

(ii) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative
an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published
by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the original issue date of the Notes,
there has been a change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect
that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the outstanding
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the
same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had
not occurred;

(iii) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’
Representative an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the beneficial owners of the outstanding
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts,
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(iv) the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative an Officers’ Request Certificate
stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of the

246


-----

Notes over the other creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or
defrauding creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(v) the Issuer must have delivered to the Holders’ Representative an Officers’ Request Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and qualifications, each stating
that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance, as
the case may be, have been complied with.

The Holders’ Representative shall be entitled to accept any Opinion of Counsel delivered to it pursuant to
this paragraph as sufficient evidence of compliance with the relevant paragraph and shall not be obligated
to independently investigate whether the requirements of the relevant paragraph are otherwise met.

on such date of determination or if the transaction giving rise to the need to calculate the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is an Incurrence of Indebtedness, Consolidated EBITDA and
Fixed Charges for such period shall be calculated after giving effect on a pro forma basis to
such Indebtedness as if such Indebtedness had been Incurred on the first day of such period

related commitment terminated), Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed Charges for such period
shall be calculated after giving effect on a _pro forma basis to such discharge of such_
Indebtedness, including with the proceeds of such new Indebtedness, as if such discharge had
occurred on the first day of such period;

(2) the pro forma calculation of Fixed Charges shall not give effect to (i) any Indebtedness Incurred
on such date of calculation pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph
described under ‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (other than for the purposes of the
calculation of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio under clause (x) thereunder) or (ii) the discharge
on such date of calculation of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the
proceeds Incurred pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph described under
‘‘—Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

(3) if since the beginning of such period the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary will have made any
Asset Disposition or discontinued any company, division, operating unit, segment, business or

(4) if since the beginning of such period the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (by merger or
otherwise) will have made an Investment in any Restricted Subsidiary (or any Person which
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or is merged with or into the Issuer) or an acquisition of assets,
including any acquisition of assets occurring in connection with a transaction requiring a
calculation to be made hereunder, and which constitutes all or substantially all of a company,
division, operating unit, segment, business, group of related assets or line of business,
Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed Charges for such period shall be calculated after giving _pro_
_forma effect thereto (including the Incurrence of any Indebtedness) as if such Investment or_
acquisition occurred on the first day of such period; and

256


-----

(5) if since the beginning of such period any Person (that subsequently became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was merged with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary since the beginning
of such period) will have Incurred any Indebtedness or discharged any Indebtedness, made any
Asset Disposition or any Investment or acquisition of assets that would have required an
adjustment pursuant to clause (3) or (4) of this definition if made by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary during such period, Consolidated EBITDA and Fixed Charges for such period shall be
calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Incurrence or discharge of Indebtedness,
Asset Disposition or Investment or acquisition of assets occurred on the first day of such period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever _pro forma effect is to be given to any calculation under this_
definition, the _pro forma calculations (including, without limitation, in respect of anticipated expense or_
cost savings and expense or cost synergies relating to any such transaction) shall be determined in good
faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer. If any Indebtedness bears a floating rate
of interest and is being given _pro forma effect, the interest expense on such Indebtedness shall be_
calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness).

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS**

The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations regarding the European Union,
Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom and France. The descriptions below are only a
summary and do not purport to be complete or to discuss all insolvency law considerations that may affect
the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes’’._

**EUROPEAN UNION**

On June 5, 2015, Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings (the ‘‘EU Insolvency Regulation’’) was published in the Official Gazette of
the European Union.

**_Main insolvency proceedings_**

Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open
insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the member state of the European Union
(the ‘‘Member State’’) (other than Denmark) within which the center of a debtor’s main interests is
situated. The ‘‘center of main interests’’ is defined as ‘‘the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties’’. Pursuant to
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the center of main interests of a company or legal person is
presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the
contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another
Member State within a three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.
Specifically, it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is
located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment
of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s
actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that
other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception
as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of
main interests, this may require informing the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is
carrying out its activities in due course (e.g. by drawing attention to the change of address in commercial
correspondence or otherwise making the new location public through other appropriate means).

If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a company at the time an insolvency application is made, is located in a
Member State (other than Denmark), the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under
the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to
the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State
within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with Article 3 shall
have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked
with them, such as avoidance actions.

**_Secondary insolvency proceedings_**

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be
opened in other Member States. If the ‘‘center of main interests’’ of a debtor is in one Member State
(other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member
State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open ‘‘secondary’’ or ‘‘territorial’’ insolvency proceedings
only in the event that such debtor has an ‘‘establishment’’ in the territory of such other Member State.
Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency
Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding up proceedings. Territorial
proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main
insolvency proceedings and which will usually convert to secondary proceedings on the opening of the main
proceedings. ‘‘Establishment’’ is defined as any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has
carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a

273


-----

non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial insolvency
proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State.

Pursuant to Article 3(4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where main proceedings in the Member State in
which the company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency
proceedings can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment and
either: (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of
main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are
opened at the request of a creditor whose claim arises from or in connection with the operation of such
establishment or a public authority, which has the right to request such opening under the respective
Member State’s law, requests the opening of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the
insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to
certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus; that is, the local insolvency law of the court that
has assumed jurisdiction for the respective main, territorial or secondary insolvency proceedings, as the
case may be, of the company.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency officeholder appointed by the court
in the Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers
conferred on him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such
as to remove assets of the company from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain
limitations (e.g. the powers are available provided that so long as no insolvency proceedings have been
opened in that other Member State nor any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to
a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets).

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may prevent the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member
State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which
secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened. For this purpose, the insolvency practitioner must
undertake to comply with the distribution and priority rights under the relevant national law from which
the local creditors would benefit if the insolvency proceedings were opened in the Member State where the
assets are located. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified
majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with applicable local laws. If approved, the
undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency
proceedings, it should, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings,
refuse to open such proceeding if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general
interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its
creditors, the court, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may
stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided
that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request
from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a renewable period of up to three
months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process
of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary
insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings
will be required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3; such decision may be
challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

**_Insolvency proceedings involving members of a group of companies_**

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides for a cooperation and communication mechanism in the event
that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened.
Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with
any insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to the

274


-----

extent that such cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also
cooperate with any other court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another
member of the group to the extent that cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration
of the proceedings, is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of
interest. In this respect, the courts may, where appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not
incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

**GERMANY**

**_Insolvency_**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered offices
in Germany and, except for shareholding interests in certain subsidiaries, substantially all of their assets are
located in Germany. Consequently, any insolvency proceedings with regard to the Issuer and these certain
Guarantors are likely to be initiated in Germany and, if the Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, were
held to have their center of main interests within the territory of Germany pursuant to the EU Insolvency
Regulation (see ‘‘—European Union’’) at the time the application for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsantrag) is filed, German insolvency law would most likely govern such
proceedings. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency
Code (Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions,
including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and
the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit the ability of creditors to recover
payments due on the Notes, as applicable, to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite
the economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate
insolvency proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the
part of the relevant entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other
insolvency proceedings (if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and
liabilities of a group of companies in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective
entities of a group. Recently, the German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group
insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bew¨altigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on
April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency
proceedings of group companies. The act does not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency
proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key
amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group
insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the
appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated;
(iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and
creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for ‘‘coordination proceedings’’
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a ‘‘coordination insolvency administrator’’
(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a ‘‘coordination plan’’ (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court
_ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency_
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of
over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts
as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its
assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern
is predominantly likely (¨uberwiegend wahrscheinlich) at least for the current and the subsequent fiscal year
(positive Fortf¨uhrungsprognose). As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if it is unable to pay 10% or
more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that
the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter (demn¨achst) and it can be deemed acceptable to
the creditor to continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or
a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an

275


-----

individual as personally liable shareholder—such as the Issuer—becomes illiquid and/or over-indebted, the
management of such company and, under certain circumstances, its shareholders are obliged to file for the
opening of insolvency proceedings without undue delay, however, at the latest within three (3) weeks after
the mandatory insolvency reason, i.e., illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, occurred. Non-compliance with
these obligations exposes management to both severe damage claims as well as sanctions under criminal
law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments, including any payments under the
Notes, are voidable. In addition, imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) is a valid insolvency
reason under German law which exists if the company currently is able to service its payments obligations,
but will presumably not be able to continue to do so at some point in time within a certain prognosis
period. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening
of insolvency proceedings if the debtor is likely to not be able to pay its debts as and when they fall due.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorl¨aufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzer¨offnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures
taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In
addition, the court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorl¨aufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter), unless the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung)—an_
insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the
debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that no
circumstances are known which lead to the expectation that debtor-in-possession status will place the
creditors at a disadvantage.

Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may appoint a
preliminary creditors’ committee (vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for
debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed
or to suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. A preliminary creditors’ committee
(vorl¨aufiger Gl¨aubigerausschuss) must be set up if the debtor satisfies two of the following three
requirements: a balance sheet total of at least A6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor
is over-indebted), revenues of at least A12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last balance sheet date
and/or fifty or more employees on an annual-average basis. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be
able to participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. For example, the preliminary creditors’
committee will have the ability to influence the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator
(vorl¨aufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter), court orders authorizing
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Anordnung der Eigenverwaltung) and appointment of a preliminary
custodian (vorl¨aufiger Sachwalter). In case the members of the preliminary creditors’ committee
unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested
individual is not eligible; i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’
committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it should and usually does comprise a
representative of the secured creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as
one for the employees. The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to
safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets (which may include the continuation of the business carried
out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net
assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings.

The court orders the opening (Er¨offnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings (er¨offnetes
_Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets_
(Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not
expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties
(e.g., creditors) advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (usually, but not
necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the
insolvency court unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets
of the debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) only
being entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first
creditors’ assembly (erste Gl¨aubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of
votes cast (by head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual

276


-----

becoming the new insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder,
_i.e. sufficiently qualified, business-experienced and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new_
financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities
incurred by the insolvency administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate
(Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the
residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining after realization of the available collateral (if
any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the Holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such
opening of formal insolvency proceedings against the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their relevant
subsidiaries that are subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

  - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their
relevant subsidiaries would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as
sole representative of the insolvency estate;

   - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to the Issuer,
such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of the
Issuer, such Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are
null and void by operation of law;

   - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a
creditor in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of the Issuer’s, such Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that
would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation
of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and

   - claims against the Issuer, such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued
in accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or ‘‘escape clauses’’
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the
occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene K¨undigungsrechte
_oder L¨osungsklauseln) may be invalid if they frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator_
whether or not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless they reflect termination
rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German
law.

Any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person does not
constitute part of the insolvency estate) does not participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for
separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency
administrator.

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the
insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)) as opposed to a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht), wishing to
assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. German
insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally no longer pursue their
individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance
with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Therefore, secured creditors are
generally not entitled to enforce any security interest outside the insolvency proceedings. In the insolvency
proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte). Depending
on the legal nature of the security interest entitlement to enforce such security is either vested with the
secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that the insolvency
administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s possession
which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or
security transfer of title (Sicherungs¨ubereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security
assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen).

Creditors secured by pledges over shares in subsidiaries of the debtor are entitled to preferential
satisfaction with regard to the proceeds realized in an enforcement process which has to be effected by
means of a public auction outside the insolvency process. However, in the absence of authoritative case
law, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled to initiate the enforcement process in respect

277


-----

of the pledged shares on their own or, as far as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate,
whether the insolvency administrator has standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of
the secured creditors. Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the
insolvency administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction
(Absonderungsrecht) with regard to the disposal proceeds. Consequently, the enforcement proceeds, less
certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and
(ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the aggregate, usually add up to 9% (or more
in certain circumstances) of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the
creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims.
With the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the
creditors of the insolvency estate (Massegl¨aubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as
well as any preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings). Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of
unsecured creditors, will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interest and the preferential claims against the estate
have been settled and paid in full.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) or to separation (Aussonderungsrecht)
may not necessarily prevent the insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this
right. The insolvency administrator must, however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting
from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the
relevant debtor for the return of funds or the payment of a consideration), while claims of a person who
becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank
senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency
proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgl¨aubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated
creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below under
‘‘Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims’’.

It may take several years before an insolvency payment, if any, is distributed to unsecured creditors. While
in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the Issuer’s, any Guarantor’s or any of their relevant
subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s
business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken
based on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency
administrator and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the Issuer,
such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries and the consent of each class of creditors in
accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency court (while a group of
dissenting creditors or the debtor can-under certain circumstances-be crammed down). If the debtor is a
corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can be
included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to
creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain circumstances
provide for provisions regarding the Notes, the guarantees or the collateral which are less favorable to the
Holders of the Notes than the provisions of the German Insolvency Code, such as the release of the
collateral, the release of obligations under the Notes or the contribution of the Notes in exchange for
equity. Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected
Holders of the Notes.

Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings based on an
insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness), combined with a
petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a restructuring
of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of up to three
months to utilize an insolvency plan for the debtor business (Schutzschirm). During this period, the
creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing debtor—be suspended. Under
these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) to supervise the process.
The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian with such suggestion being
binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible to become a custodian
(i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial).

278


-----

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession
proceedings, the custodian) may void (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal
insolvency proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or
other acts are successfully voided by the insolvency administrator or custodian, as the case may be, any
amounts or other benefits derived from such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be
returned to the insolvency estate. The administrator’s or custodian’s right to void transactions can,
depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing
for the commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to
the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency
laws of Germany, the payment of any amounts to the Holders of the Notes as well as the granting of
Collateral for or providing credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential
challenges (i.e., clawback rights) by an insolvency administrator or custodian under the rules of voidness as
set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully
voided (angefochten), the Holders of the Notes, may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under
the Notes or the Collateral and may participate in the insolvency proceedings as unsecured creditors only.
If payments have already been made under the Notes or Collateral, any amounts received from a
transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). In this
case, the Holders of the Notes, as applicable, would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes,
as applicable, without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgesch¨aft) (which term includes the
granting of a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) which is detrimental to the
creditors of the debtor may be avoided, inter alia, in the following cases, as recently amended by the Act for
the improvement of legal certainty concerning avoidance claims pursuant to the German Insolvency Code
and the German Code on Avoidance (Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach
_der Insolvenzordnung und dem Anfechtungsgesetz vom 29. M¨arz 2017) that came into force on April 5, 2017:_

  - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for debt if such act was taken (i) during the last three
months prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that
the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunf¨ahig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of
such illiquidity (or of circumstances that compellingly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such
time, or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor
knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances that compellingly
suggest such illiquidity or filing);

  - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for debt to which such creditor was not entitled, or which
was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to
such security or satisfaction, if such act was taken (i) during the last month prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) during the second or third
month prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) during the
second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other
insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that compellingly suggest such detrimental
effect);

   - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a
debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior
to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at
the time of such legal transaction and the counterparty to such legal transaction knew of the
illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the counterparty to such legal transaction knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or
of such filing at the time of the legal transaction;

   - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security for a
third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it
was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings;

279


-----

  - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the
intention of prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vors¨atzliche Gl¨aubigerbenachteiligung) and the
beneficiary of the act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted
a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year
period is reduced to four years; ‘‘knowledge by the beneficiary of the act’’ in terms of such provision
is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende
_Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the_
relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a form or
at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the ‘‘knowledge by the beneficiary of the
act’’ is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene
_Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the_
creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a
presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at this time;

  - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly
operates to the detriment of the creditors can be voided unless such contract was concluded earlier
than two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time
the contract was concluded; in relation to corporate entities, the term ‘‘affiliated party’’ includes,
subject to certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners
and shareholders owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies
holding comparable positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of
the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the
foregoing persons;

  - any act that provides security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or economically similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security,
the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act
took place during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency
proceedings or after the filing of such petition; or

   - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim
to a third party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had
granted security or was liable as a guarantor (Garant) or surety (B¨urge) (in which case the
shareholder must compensate the debtor for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, ‘‘knowledge’’ is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which
the conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or
intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge
of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or
imminent illiquidity, as the case may be, and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With
respect to an ‘‘affiliated party’’, there is a general statutory presumption that such party had ‘‘knowledge’’ .

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a ‘‘cash transaction’’
and may as such be privileged—under certain circumstances—under the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) (Bargesch¨aftsprivileg) by not being subject to voidness rights.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement
order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the
relevant security right according to the German Act on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal
insolvency proceedings. The prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the
voidance periods are calculated from the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future due to the directive
of the European Parliament and of the Council on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance
and measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures and
amending Directive 2012/30/EU, proposed by the EU Commission as of November 22, 2016 and adopted

280


-----

by the European Parliament on March 28, 2019, which may, inter alia, stipulate that claims of the relevant
creditors may be modified by majority vote and against the voting of a single creditor even outside formal
insolvency proceedings.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the
debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the
claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs
incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines,
regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a
criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous
performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms to
such a loan.

**_Insolvency proceedings regarding natural persons_**

The two minority shareholders of the Issuer are natural persons. A natural person is only insolvent in case
of an (imminent) inability to pay its debts as and when they fall due (Zahlungsunf¨ahigkeit); an insolvency
based on over-indebtedness (Uberschuldung[¨] ) does not apply to natural persons.

To the extent they do not operate commercially (and have not done so recently), the consumer insolvency
proceedings (Verbraucherinsolvenzverfahren) might apply to the minority shareholders. These are
insolvency proceedings based on three stages: (1) Prior to the filing for insolvency, the debtor has to set up
and offer its creditors a plan to settle his debts in the course of an out-of-court debt-adjustment procedure
(außergerichtliches Schuldenbereinigungsverfahren). During this out-of-court procedure, the general rules
apply with respect to an enforcement of security interests, i.e., there are no restrictions on enforcement of
security. (2) If the debtor fails to reach a settlement with its creditors, he/she may file for insolvency. The
insolvency court will then initiate an in-court debt-adjustment procedure (gerichtliches
_Schuldenbereinigungsverfahren) in which the court may, under certain circumstances, replace a creditor’s_
consent to a settlement. During this in-court procedure, the preliminary insolvency proceedings (vorl¨aufiges
_Insolvenzverfahren) are pending but the court may order preliminary restrictions on enforcement of_
security which might include the enforcement of the share pledges. (3) If the in-court procedure also fails,
the court may open insolvency proceedings. With respect to security interests granted by a natural person,
the insolvency proceedings do not differ much from the general insolvency proceedings. The consumer
insolvency proceedings may also include an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) but the debtor may not apply
for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung). If not the natural person but one of its creditors files for
insolvency over the assets of the natural person, the court allows the natural person/debtor to file for
insolvency as well. If the debtor does so, he/she has to follow the above mentioned three steps. If the
debtor refuses to file for insolvency, the court may open insolvency proceedings straight away.

Natural persons may under certain circumstances apply to be discharged from all residual debt remaining
at the end of an insolvency proceeding (Restschuldbefreiung) if they agree to assign the seizable part of
their wages for a period of generally six years from the opening of the insolvency proceedings to a courtappointed trustee. The period can be reduced to five years if the debtor has paid all costs of the
proceedings or even three years if the amount that has been paid to the trustee is sufficient to repay at
least 35% of the debt. The insolvency creditors may request the court to deny the discharge based on
certain reasons stated in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). The discharge of all residual
debt would not affect the pledges granted by the minority shareholders as the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) excludes certain security interests (including pledges) from the effects of the discharge.

An insolvency administrator may void the granting of the pledges by the minority shareholders in the cases
described above, in particular claiming the minority shareholders did not receive a (sufficient)
consideration for providing the pledges.

**_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests_**

The granting of guarantees by German Guarantors will be subject to certain German capital maintenance
rules of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften

281


-----

_mit beschr¨ankter Haftung) (the ‘‘GmbHG’’) if that Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the legal form_
of a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschr¨ankter Haftung—a ‘‘GmbH’’) or a German
limited partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner (a ‘‘GmbH & Co. KG’’). As
a general rule, sections 30 and 31 GmbHG prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its shareholders
to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves)—
or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would fall below the amount of its
stated share capital (Unterbilanz/Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees or security interests granted by
a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or
sister company are considered disbursements under sections 30 and 31 GmbHG. Moreover, under
section 64 sentence 3 GmbHG a managing director (Gesch¨aftsf¨uhrer) of a GmbH can be held personally
liable in certain circumstances for payments to shareholders that would render the GmbH illiquid. The
granting of guarantees and security interests for the benefit of direct or indirect parent or sister companies
of the GmbH could be considered as such disbursements and payments to shareholders.

In relation to a GmbH & Co. KG the capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules and principles
described above for GmbHs apply, mutatis mutandis, also to the general partners of the GmbH & Co. KGs.

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and to provide security interests to
secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating German
capital maintenance and/or liquidity maintenance rules and to limit any potential personal liability of
management, it is standard market practice for notes, credit agreements, indentures, related guarantees
and related security documents to contain so-called ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries
incorporated in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such ‘‘limitation
language’’, the beneficiaries of the guarantees contractually agree to enforce the guarantees and security
interests against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent that such enforcement does not result in
the subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general partner’s—net assets falling below, or
increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Guarantee Agreement, to the extent provided by a
Guarantor incorporated in Germany in a relevant corporate form as described above, contain or will
contain such contractual limitation language and such guarantees are limited in the manner described. This
could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by such Guarantor cannot be enforced
at all.

German capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules are subject to court decisions on an ongoing
basis (see, for example, the more recent decision of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) dated March 21, 2017, file no. II ZR 93/16, regarding the preservation of the share
capital). Future court decisions may further limit the access of shareholders to assets of their subsidiaries
constituted in the form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the
Issuer to make payment on the Notes or of the German Guarantors to make payments on the related
guarantees.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called ‘‘destructive interference’’ (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a
situation in which a shareholder deprives its company of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own
payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a guarantee or security
interests granted by the Issuer and a German Guarantor. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be
realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security or guarantee agreement may be void due to tortious
inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the distressed financial situation of the debtor
and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its
other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to
the granting of guarantees and/or security interests to be granted by the Issuer and the German
Guarantors. Furthermore, the beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital
of the grantor of the guarantee or the security interests could become personally liable under exceptional
circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case
if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the
other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of _bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such_
intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating
that the grantor of the guarantee or security interests was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had
reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

282


-----

**_Accessory security interests/Parallel debt_**

Under German law, certain security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) are of strict accessory nature
and are therefore dependent on the secured claims and require the security holder and the creditor of the
secured claim to be identical. Such accessory security interests (akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) (i) will
automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated, (ii) may not be assigned
independently, but would automatically follow the claims they secure in case the relevant secured claim is
assigned and (iii) may only be granted to the creditor of a claim to be secured by the accessory security
interest.

The accessory security interests will also be granted to the Security Agent. The Security Agent is however
not a creditor under the Notes. The Holders of the Notes on the other hand are creditors under the Notes
and the Guarantees. In order to allow the Holders of the Notes to benefit from the pledges, such pledges
will also secure a so-called ‘‘parallel debt’’ obligation created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor
of the Security Agent rather than secure the Holders of the Notes’ claims under the Notes directly. The
parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the creditors under
the Notes and the Guarantees (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’), and any payment in respect of the Principal
Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt
will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the Security Agent will have, pursuant to
the parallel debt, a claim against the Holders of the Notes and the Guarantors for the full principal amount
of the Notes, the legal concept of creating parallel debt obligations has not yet been tested before a
German court. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that such concept will not be recognized by German
courts or that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of invalidity and unenforceability of pledges. Therefore,
the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted.

Moreover, the Security Agent holds the pledges in trust. This means that in the case of an insolvency of the
Security Agent, the insolvency administrator over the insolvency estate of the Security Agent may
successfully claim that there is no separation right (Aussonderungsrecht) of the Holders of the Notes with
respect to the secured claims. As a consequence the secured claims (including the parallel debt) and the
accessory security rights would remain with the (then insolvent) Security Agent.

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the security holder upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the sale
of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which certain
waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the security
interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the entities having
granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts
have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking)
in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right
to intervene (i.e., the right to request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other
creditors).

**FRANCE**

**_Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount (‘‘soulte’’)_**

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due
and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities account may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale
being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or
contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following
which the secured creditors become the legal owners of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors
choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the
secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is
determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed
expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of
secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the
difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is
true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a
subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

283


-----

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the
relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining
amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with
applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the
sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not
be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and
controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the
purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

**_Recognition of validity of second or lower ranking financial securities account pledges by French courts_**

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (soci´et´e par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over
the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such
company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not
registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a
result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of
such a company are registered.

Moreover, a pledge over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account
from the possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower
ranking pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will
therefore provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed
third party as ‘‘tiers convenu’’ (entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured
parties have consented to the creation of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking secured
parties have accepted the appointment of the agreed third party as _tiers convenu and that it hold the_
pledged securities as custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking and the second or lower ranking
secured parties. This structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurances can be
given that such second or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that
the second or lower ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are
respectively registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially
adversely affect the recovery under the Notes or Notes Guarantees (as applicable) following an
enforcement event.

**POLAND**

**_Overview_**

Progroup Board sp. z o.o. (the ‘‘Polish Guarantor’’), being a Polish limited liability company (Polish:
_sp´ołka z ograniczon˛a odpowiedzialno´sci˛a, sp. z o.o.) is incorporated and existing under the laws of Poland._
Comments made below are relevant for the Polish limited liability company.

In the event of insolvency of the Polish Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Poland.
Note, however, that if the center of main interest of the Polish Guarantor is situated in another European
Union member state, the courts of that state shall have jurisdiction and the insolvency laws of that state
shall apply pursuant to the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
May 20, 2015, on insolvency proceedings (Official Journal No. L 141 of June 5, 2015).

If the centre of main interest of the Polish Guarantor is situated in Poland, the insolvency proceedings
would be governed by the Bankruptcy Law (Polish: _Prawo Upadło´sciowe) of February 28, 2003_
(consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2019, item 498, as amended) (the ‘‘Bankruptcy Law’’), and a new
restructuring law (Polish: Prawo Restrukturyzacyjne) of May 15, 2015 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of
2019, item 243, as amended) (the ‘‘Restructuring Law’’).

Please find below the general and non-exhaustive description of certain provisions of the Bankruptcy Law
and the Restructuring Law.

Note that the Bankruptcy Law and the Restructuring Law may not be as favorable to your interests as
creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions, including in respect of priority of creditors, the
ability to obtain interest after the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the duration of the
insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes and the
Guarantees to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

**_Insolvent debtor_**

Bankruptcy proceedings under Polish law may be initiated against insolvent debtors.

The debtor is deemed insolvent if it loses the ability to settle its due and payable financial liabilities (which
will be presumed to be the case if a delay in payment exceeds three months).

Under the balance sheet test (for a debtor being a legal person, e.g. a limited liability company), the debtor
will be deemed insolvent if according to its balance sheet, its financial obligations (except for future
liabilities, including liabilities subject to a suspensory condition, and shareholder loans or other legal act
having the similar effects) exceed the value of their assets and this status continues for longer than twenty
four months. Note that even if the above conditions are met, the court may reject a bankruptcy petition,
provided that there is no threat to the debtor’s ability to perform its due and payable obligations in a short
term.

**_Bankruptcy petition_**

Bankruptcy proceedings are initiated upon submitting a bankruptcy petition. Such a petition may be
submitted by either the debtor or its personal creditors.

According to the Bankruptcy Law, the catalogue of persons authorized and obliged to submit a bankruptcy
petition for the debtor has been determined, inter alia, as all persons who on the basis of the law, articles of
association/statute of the company have the right to conduct the company’s affairs and to represent it. The
deadline for submitting the bankruptcy petition is thirty days from the date on which the reason for
bankruptcy occurred.

Note that persons obliged to submit the bankruptcy petition may be held liable for damages resulting from
a delay in submitting the petition to the court.

The court is obliged to refuse to initiate bankruptcy proceedings if the debtor’s assets are insufficient to
cover the cost of the proceedings or, additionally if the debtor’s assets are sufficient to cover only the cost
of the proceedings. The court may also reject the petition to declare bankruptcy if the debtor’s assets are
encumbered with a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge or maritime mortgage to such a
degree that the debtor’s remaining assets are not sufficient to cover the cost of the proceedings.

**_Safeguard procedure before the bankruptcy proceedings_**

Upon receiving a bankruptcy petition, the court can, ex officio or upon a motion, secure the debtor’s assets.

The court may also secure the debtor’s assets, _inter alia, through the appointment of an interim court_
supervisor (Polish: _tymczasowy nadzorca s˛adowy) or a mandatory administrator (Polish:_ _zarz˛adca_
_przymusowy), and suspend the execution proceedings against the debtor (and additionally the court may_
revoke seizure of a bank account).

**_Bankruptcy proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, there is one bankruptcy proceedings, i.e. liquidation bankruptcy
proceedings.

Upon acceptance of the bankruptcy petition, the court decides whether to initiate the bankruptcy
proceedings. This decision shall be made within two months of submitting the bankruptcy petition,
however this deadline has only instructive character.

The date of the bankruptcy is the date on which the bankruptcy order is issued by the court.

Creditors have the right to submit their claims within thirty days from the announcement of the bankruptcy
order; claims may be submitted also after the lapse of the set deadline, however, all actions undertaken in
the bankruptcy proceedings until that date are valid towards the creditor. If a claim is not included in the
list prepared by a court receiver, the creditor has the right to appeal. The procedural requirements for
submitting claims are very formal.

**_Prepared liquidation (so called ‘‘pre-pack’’)_**

The Bankruptcy Law provides for an institution called prepared liquidation (Polish: _przygotowana_
_likwidacja), also called ‘‘pre-pack’’._

285


-----

In the pre-pack procedure, the bankruptcy petition may be accompanied by an application for approval of
the terms of sale of a debtor’s enterprise, its organized part or assets representing a major part of its
enterprise. Nevertheless, it may not include assets secured with registered pledge if the registered pledge
agreement provides for foreclosure of the assets or their sale to satisfy a pledgee’s claims (unless a pledgee
gives its consent).

Such application for approval of terms of sale must specify at least the sale price and a potential purchaser,
and be accompanied by a valuation report prepared by a certified court expert.

It is possible to request that the debtor’s enterprise will be handed over to the purchaser on the bankruptcy
declaration day, in which case the full price will have to be paid in advance to the court’s deposit account.
Note that the sale to an affiliated company of the debtor is permissible only at a price not lower than the
price indicated in the valuation report.

The court is obliged to accept the application if the offered price is higher than the estimated liquidation
proceeds that could be raised in ‘‘standard’’ bankruptcy proceedings, less the estimated costs of the
proceedings. If the offered price is lower than (but still close to) the estimated net liquidation proceeds, the
court will still be in a position to approve the sale if it is supported by an ‘‘important social interest’’ or if it
allows the distressed enterprise to be preserved.

Each creditor will be entitled to appeal against the court’s decision approving a pre-packed sale within a
week of its publication (whereas only the petitioner may appeal against a negative decision).

**_Liquidation bankruptcy_**

The Bankruptcy Law provides for one uniform bankruptcy proceedings.

As a rule, upon the court declaring liquidation bankruptcy, the debtor loses its right to manage its assets
and a bankruptcy receiver (Polish: _syndyk masy upadło´sci) is appointed. The financial liabilities of the_
debtor that have not yet become due and payable, become due and payable on the day the bankruptcy
order is issued. The debtor’s assets become the bankruptcy estate to be used to settle the debtor’s
creditors. The bankruptcy estate is managed by a bankruptcy receiver appointed by the court. Consent of
the creditors’ committee (Polish: _zgromadzenie wierzycieli) or the bankruptcy receiver responsible for_
administering the bankruptcy is required for specified decisions made in relation to some matters
connected with the bankruptcy process.

As a rule, the preferred type of liquidation under the Bankruptcy Law is the sale of the bankrupt’s business
as a whole.

**_Ineffectiveness of some legal acts with respect to the bankruptcy estate_**

Following the declaration of bankruptcy, the bankrupt’s assets become the bankruptcy estate, which serves
to satisfy the claims of the bankrupt’s creditors. The bankruptcy estate covers, subject to exceptions, the
assets belonging to the insolvent debtor on the date of the bankruptcy or acquired by it during the
bankruptcy proceedings. Bankruptcy Law lists assets that are excluded from the bankruptcy estate by virtue
of law, while other assets of the debtor can be excluded from the bankruptcy estate by a resolution of the
creditors’ committee or through the proceedings reviewed by the judge-commissioner (Polish: _s˛edzia-_
_komisarz)._

Under the Bankruptcy Law, contractual provisions which provide for a change or termination of a legal
relationship, to which the bankrupt is a party to, due to the declaration of bankruptcy (or in the case of
filling a petition for bankruptcy), are null and void. Furthermore, contractual provisions, which make it
impossible or difficult to achieve the objective of the bankruptcy proceedings, are ineffective towards the
bankruptcy estate.

Legal transactions are ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if concluded by the bankrupt within one
year preceding the day, on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted and resulting in the bankrupt
disposing of its assets: (i) without any reciprocal consideration for the bankrupt or (ii) bankrupt’s
consideration significantly exceeds the value of the consideration received by the bankrupt or reserved for
the bankrupt or a third party.

Also ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate is granting of collateral for an undue debt and the payment
of such debt effected by the insolvent debtor in six months preceding the day, on which the bankruptcy
petition was submitted. The beneficiaries of such actions may, however, aim to have these transactions

286


-----

considered effective, if they have not been aware of grounds for the declaration of bankruptcy while
receiving payment or being granted the collateral.

Moreover, in relation to non-gratuitous legal transactions concluded by an insolvent legal person with its
shareholders, representatives (including their spouses), as well as affiliated companies, their shareholders
or representatives (including their spouses) executed within six months before the day on which the
bankruptcy petition was submitted, the judge-commissioner (Polish: s˛edzia-komisarz) is entitled to declare
them ineffective (ex officio or upon a motion) unless the party to such legal transaction demonstrates that
such transaction was not to the creditors’ detriment.

In addition, a transfer of future receivable is ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate if such receivable
arises after the declaration of bankruptcy, unless the agreement on the transfer of receivable was
concluded in writing with a certified date (Polish: forma pisemna z dat˛a pewn˛a) at least six months before
the day on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted.

Mortgages, pledges, registered pledges or maritime mortgages established by the bankrupt within one year
preceding the day on which the bankruptcy petition was submitted may be challenged in one of the
following situations: (i) the bankrupt was not the personal debtor of the creditor (e.g. if the debtor was a
guarantor) and the bankrupt did not receive any consideration in connection with such security, (ii) the
consideration received was substantially lower than the value of the security, or (iii) the security interests
was established for the benefit of its shareholders, representatives (including their spouses), as well as
affiliated companies, their shareholders or representatives (including their spouses). The judgecommissioner, acting upon a motion, is competent to decide on the ineffectiveness of the established
security towards the bankruptcy estate, however in case described in point (iii) above it is obliged to decide
on such ineffectiveness unless the party to such legal transaction demonstrates that it was not to the
creditors’ detriment.

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law, the judge-commissioner, is authorized to deem ineffective towards the
bankruptcy estate any contractual penalty (reserved for non-performance or improper performance of
obligations) if the obligation was already performed to a large extent or the contractual penalty is
excessive.

The transfer of the ownership title to a thing, claim or other right to the creditor (Polish: przewłaszczenie na
_zabezpieczenie) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate if such agreement has been made in writing with_
a certified date.

A credit agreement expires on the date bankruptcy is declared if prior to that date the lender did not
disburse the funds to the bankrupt. The lender may pursue a claim in the bankruptcy proceedings for
compensation by filing the claim with the judge-commissioner. If only a portion of the funds was disbursed
to the bankrupt prior to the date of declaring bankruptcy, the bankrupt loses the right to request the
disbursement of the remaining balance.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not affect the bankrupt’s bank account agreement, securities account
agreement, account agreement for derivatives, clearing account or collective account agreement.

**_Other selected consequences of bankruptcy_**

After the declaration of bankruptcy, the bankruptcy estate, as a general rule, cannot be encumbered with a
mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge or a maritime mortgage in order to secure a liability
incurred before the declaration of bankruptcy. Additionally it is forbidden to encumber the bankruptcy
estate with a compulsory mortgage or a treasury pledge in order to secure a liability that arises after the
declaration of bankruptcy.

Declaration of bankruptcy proceedings affects current court or administrative proceedings and debt
collection proceedings. After declaration of the bankruptcy order, courts and administrative proceedings
related to the bankruptcy estate may be opened and continued only by the a bankruptcy receiver or against
him. Execution proceeding concerning a claim subject to filing to the bankruptcy estate, opened before the
bankruptcy has been declared, shall be stayed by the virtue of law as at the date bankruptcy is declared.
Execution proceeding shall be discontinued by the virtue of law after the decision declaring bankruptcy
becomes final.

287


-----

**_Satisfaction of claims in bankruptcy proceedings_**

In the case of bankruptcy, settling the creditors’ claims is usually only possible upon the registration of the
claims by the bankruptcy receiver. The claims are satisfied according to certain priorities. The costs of
bankruptcy proceedings are covered by separate legal provision, which sets out that costs of bankruptcy
proceedings shall be satisfied on an on-going basis during the process of liquidation, before first category.
Claims described in the below categories are settled only after all costs of the bankruptcy proceedings,
debts of bankruptcy estate have been settled.

Unsecured creditors’ claims are settled in the following order (as far as a legal person is concerned):

   - first category—this category, inter alia, covers claims arising out of an employment relationship
falling due and payable before the bankruptcy was declared, with certain exceptions, certain
contributions to the social security insurance system, certain claims which arise during restructuring
proceedings, claims arising from credit, loans, bonds, guarantees or letters of credit or other
financing arrangement provided in the approved restructuring proceedings and granted in
connection with the performance of such arrangement (if the bankruptcy was declared as a
recognition of a bankruptcy petition submitted not later than three months after the final repeal of
such restructuring arrangement).

   - second category—covers claims not covered in other categories including claims payable to private
creditors as well as tax liabilities, other public levies and contributions to the social security
insurance system. Thus, private creditors are treated equally with tax authorities.

  - third category—covers subordinated interest on claims included in the senior categories in the
order, in which they are paid on the capital, as well as judicial and administrative fines and claims
arising under donations and legacies.

  - fourth category—covers shareholders’ claims arising from loan agreements as well as other legal
transactions with similar effects, which were executed within five years before the bankruptcy
announcement was made (with some exceptions such as loans granted within the frame of the
restructuring proceedings or loans granted by the shareholders), shareholders under this category
are also entitled to interest on described transactions.

Settling claims from one of these categories is only possible after fully settling claims of the creditors from
a more senior category. If settling all debts included in the same category is not possible due to lack of
assets, the debts should be settled proportionally.

The liquidation of the bankruptcy estate is performed by selling the bankrupt’s enterprise as a whole or by
organized parts, by selling all immovable and movable property, by enforcing claims against the debtors of
the bankrupt, and by exercising other proprietary rights included in the bankruptcy estate or by alienation
thereof.

The Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between three types of sale (i.e. at an arm’s length basis, at an auction
or at a tender). The sale (transfer) of receivables is permissible. As stated above, as a rule, the bankrupt’s
enterprise should be sold as a whole.

Monies obtained from the liquidation of assets, liabilities and rights encumbered with a mortgage, a pledge
or security transfer of title, registered pledge, treasury pledge, maritime mortgages are allocated to settle
creditors’ claims that are secured by such assets, liabilities or rights (subject to certain exceptions). Monies
remaining after settling those creditors’ claims are included in the bankruptcy estate and satisfied in
accordance with categories of claims specified above.

The proceedings will be closed by the court once all the monies are distributed. The court shall also close
the insolvency proceeding in the event of lack of assets or inability to fully settle the creditors’ claims. In
some cases, liquidation may be avoided through arrangement with creditors and the company can continue
to operate.

**_Debts currency and interest due in the bankruptcy proceedings_**

Any debt payable in a currency other than Polish zloty (such as euro), if being put on the list of debts, must
be converted into Polish zloty at the National Bank of Poland’s average exchange rate for the date the
bankruptcy court issues a decision on the debtor’s bankruptcy (and regardless of whether the debt has
fallen due or not). Nevertheless, an inclusion of a debt payable in currency other than Polish zloty in the
list of bankruptcy claims does not result in conversion of such claim into claim denominated in Polish zloty.

288


-----

Furthermore, in case of unsecured claims, interest is satisfied from the assets of the bankruptcy estate only
for the time period until the date the bankruptcy is declared.

**_Restructuring proceedings_**

In order to enable insolvent or threatened with insolvency debtors to recover their ability to overcome
financial difficulties, rather than declare bankruptcy, four types of restructuring proceedings are provided
by the Restructuring Law:

  - proceedings for approval of an arrangement (Polish: post˛epowanie o zatwierdzenie układu),

  - accelerated arrangement proceedings (Polish: przyspieszone post˛epowanie układowe),

  - arrangement proceedings (Polish: post˛epowanie układowe),

   - remedial proceedings (Polish: post˛epowanie sanacyjne).

The above proceedings are aimed at the debtor concluding an arrangement with its creditors (including
partial arrangements), which enable the debtor to satisfy the creditors’ claims and operate further. The
difference in the said proceedings is in the scope of the debtor’s rights to manage its assets, and the scope
of the debtors’ protection against the creditors. Proceedings, subject to certain exceptions, are initiated by
the debtor. For instance, also a creditor is entitled to file a petition for the commencement of remedial
proceedings in relation to an insolvent legal person.

The creditors may vote in single or separate groups. If creditors vote in a single group, the arrangement is
concluded if it is accepted by the majority of voting creditors who hold in aggregate at least two thirds of
the total sum of claims held by the voting creditors (except for the proceedings for approval of an
arrangement, where the debtor collects the votes in writing itself and the required majority is measured by
reference to the total amount of claims held by creditors entitled to vote and not by reference to the
amount of claims held by voting creditors).

The creditors may be split into separate groups (classes) based on the criteria of ‘‘common category of
interests’’. In such case, the arrangement is concluded if it is accepted in each group by a majority of voting
creditors in the group whose claims amount to (in aggregate) at least two thirds of the total sum of claims
held by the voting group members (with respective modification of calculating the majority in case of
proceedings for approval of an arrangement described above). Even if there is no required majority in one
or more of the groups of creditors, the arrangement will still be deemed concluded if: (i) the creditors
representing in aggregate at least two thirds of the total sum of claims held by the voting creditors have
voted in favor of the arrangement (with respective modification of calculating the majority in case of
proceedings for approval of an arrangement described above), and (ii) the creditors from the dissenting
group/groups are satisfied through the arrangement to an extent which is not less favorable than in the case
of liquidation of the debtor.

An arrangement accepted by the required majority of creditors is subject to an approval by the court. The
court rejects the arrangement if: (i) it violates the law or (ii) it is obvious that the arrangement will not be
performed. The court is also entitled to reject the arrangement if it is obviously detrimental to creditors
who voted against it and raised objections. The accepted arrangement is binding on all creditors, whose
receivables are, under the law, covered by the arrangement, which may include claims not specified on the
creditor’s list.

In case of conflicting petitions for bankruptcy and for restructuring, the court withholds the bankruptcy
petition and the restructuring petition should be considered first (if the restructuring petition is accepted,
it will not be possible to declare bankruptcy as long as restructuring proceedings are pending).
Exceptionally, if the withholding of the bankruptcy petition should be contrary to the interest of all
creditors, the bankruptcy court may decide to consider both petitions at the same time.

Information on bankruptcy restructuring proceedings will be disclosed in the National Register of
Indebted (Polish: Krajowy Rejestr Zadłu˙zonych) operating as of December 1, 2020.

As a general rule, the arrangement covers, subject to some exceptions, all personal claims against the
debtor originated prior to the commencement of the restructuring proceedings (the day of issuing a court’s
decision on the opening of accelerated arrangement proceedings, arrangement proceedings and/or
remedial proceedings further referred to as ‘‘commencement date’’, in case of proceedings for approval of
an arrangement the consequences of commencing the restructuring proceedings take effect from the
arrangement day), together with interest accruing from the commencement date, as well as conditional

289


-----

claims, if the condition fulfils when the arrangement is being performed. Above relates both to financial
and non-financial claims (except for _inter alia certain social insurance contributions, claims under_
employment agreements or claims for the handover of property). If a creditor objects to the restructuring
of its non-financial claim (or if due the nature of a non-financial claim, it is not possible to restructure it),
the relevant claim will be converted to a financial one (with effect from the commencement date). In
addition, claims under reciprocal agreements (Polish: _umowy wzajemne) are covered by the arrangement_
only if: (i) the counterparty’s performance is divisible and (ii) only to the extent that the counterparty has
performed the agreement prior to the commencement date of the restructuring proceedings and has not
received a reciprocal consideration from the debtor.

**_‘‘Partial’’ arrangements_**

The debtor may enter into a ‘‘partial’’ arrangement (Polish: układ cz˛e´sciowy) only with selected classes of
creditors (e.g. secured creditors or significant suppliers), however, it is permitted only in (i) an
arrangement approval proceedings and (ii) accelerated arrangement proceedings. It should allow the
debtor to reach an arrangement in a faster and more discreet way. However, the selection of creditors for
that purpose must be compliant with statutory tests (i.e. it must be based on objective, unambiguous and
economically justified criteria) and must not be only aimed at eliminating dissenting creditors from
relevant voting classes.

**_Impact of restructuring proceedings on certain agreements_**

Contractual provisions, according to which termination or modification of legal relationship is triggered by
submitting a petition for the commencement of restructuring proceedings or commencement of such
proceedings are void by virtue of law. Also, the terms of agreements with the debtor to be restructured
which make it impossible or difficult to achieve the purposes of restructuring proceedings (except for
arrangement approval proceedings), are ineffective against the debtor’s estate.

In principle, upon the commencement of restructuring proceedings (other than arrangement approval
proceedings), it is prohibited to terminate certain agreements which constitute source of incomes for the
debtor, such as tenancy or lease agreements relating to the premises in which the debtor’s enterprise is
operated (unless the board of creditors agrees otherwise), property insurances, facility agreements (but
only in relation to funds made available to the debtor before the commencement date), leasing
agreements, bank account agreements, suretyships, licences granted to the debtor, guarantees and letters
of credit issued before the commencement date.

**_Preservation of security interests in restructuring proceedings_**

As a rule, it is not possible to establish new security interests to secure a claim not covered by the
arrangement (unless the board of creditors agrees otherwise) once the restructuring proceedings have
commenced. However, if an application to register a mortgage, pledge, registered pledge, treasury pledge
or maritime mortgage is filed more than six months before submitting a petition to commence
restructuring proceedings, the mortgage or pledge will be registered (in accelerated arrangement and
remedial proceedings).

Also, according to a general rule, _in rem security interests (e.g. mortgage, pledge, registered pledge,_
security assignment) securing a claim not covered by the arrangement survive the restructuring
proceedings and the claims secured by any of such security interests are not affected by the arrangement.
Hence, the arrangement covers secured claims to the extent such claims are not covered by the value of
collateral, or the relevant secured creditors agree to be covered by the arrangement. Secured creditors who
give their consent to the arrangement may be assigned to a separate group (class) of creditors and be
afforded different treatment in the arrangements from the one of unsecured creditors.

In relation to partial arrangements, the proposed arrangement offers the relevant secured creditor full
satisfaction (on a date specified in the arrangement) or satisfaction in part, but to the extent not lower than
the one, which is expected in the case of enforcement of security interest, the relevant secured claim will be
covered by the arrangement irrespective of the creditor’s consent.

**_Proceedings for approval of an arrangement_**

These proceedings are available if the sum of disputed claims does not exceed fifteen per cent of the total
claims held by creditors entitled to vote. Although, the debtor continues to manage its assets, it is required

290


-----

to appoint a licensed supervisor (Polish: _nadzorca układu), who will: (i) prepare a restructuring plan,_
(ii) cooperate with the debtor in preparing the arrangement proposals, (iii) prepare a list of claims and a
list of disputed claims, (iv) assist the debtor in proper collecting the votes of creditors in favor of the
arrangement, and (v) prepare a feasibility assessment of the arrangement in a form of a report.

The debtor determines an arrangement day (Polish: dzie´n układowy). Claims arising after the arrangement
day are not subject to the arrangement. The debtor presents a restructuring plan to its creditors and
collects their votes on the arrangement. Once the approving votes of the required regulatory majority have
been obtained, the debtor files a petition with the court (within three months from giving the votes) in
order to accept and approve the arrangement. The debtor also submits to the court a report with a
feasibility assessment of the arrangement. The court issues a decision whether to accept and approve the
arrangement within fourteen days from submitting the petition. From the date of issuing the decision, a
licensed supervisor obtains the rights of a court supervisor (Polish: _nadzorca s˛adowy) and is obliged to_
supervise the proper performance of the approved arrangement.

**_Accelerated arrangement proceedings_**

Similarly to proceedings for approval of an arrangement, these proceedings are available if the sum of
disputed claims also does not exceed fifteen per cent of the total claims held by creditors entitled to vote. It
may be used, in particular, if there is a large number of creditors and the debtor is unable to collect their
votes on the arrangement by itself.

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for the acceptance and approval of the arrangement together
with a statement that information included therein is true and complete. The court issues a decision
whether to accept and approve the arrangement within one week from submitting the petition and
appoints (i) a court supervisor (Polish: nadzorca s˛adowy), who will supervise the debtor’s management of
its assets and (ii) a judge-commissioner (Polish: _s˛edzia-komisarz), who_ _i.a. will manage the restructuring_
proceedings, supervise the activity of the court supervisor and—if applicable—(iii) the administrator. If the
court refuses to commence accelerated arrangement proceedings, the debtor may lodge a complaint
against it. The creditors, in turn, may lodge a complaint against the commencement of the accelerated
arrangement proceedings.

Within 2 weeks from the date on which the accelerated arrangement proceedings are commenced, the
court supervisor prepares and submits to the judge-commissioner (i) a restructuring plan, (ii) a list of
claims and (iii) a list of disputed claims providing them with (i) arrangement proposals, (ii) information on
division of the creditors on the grounds of their category of interests as well as on (iii) a manner of way of
voting at the creditors’ meeting. Subsequently, the judge-commissioner sets the date of the creditors’
meeting for the purpose of voting on the arrangement and informs of that date the creditors, who are on
the list of claims.

The debtor continues to manage its assets under the supervision of the court supervisor (optionally the
court may appoint an administrator (Polish: _zarz˛adca) to take over the management of the arrangement_
estate). The court may revoke the debtor’s management of assets and establish an administrator if: (i) the
debtor does not comply with the judge-commissioner’s or the court supervisor’s directions, (ii) its
management does not guarantee the performance of the arrangement or if a trustee (Polish: kurator) has
been appointed for the debtor or (iii) the debtor’s management does not comply with law (whether
intentionally or not) to the detriment (actual or potential) of the creditors.

In addition, once the accelerated arrangement proceedings are commenced, inter alia: (i) the estate which
enables the debtor to operate its undertaking and the debtor’s estate become the arrangement estate
(Polish: _masa układowa), (ii) the debtor provides the judge-commissioner and the court supervisor with_
information and documents concerning the debtor’s undertaking and assets, (iii) execution proceedings
relating to claims covered by the arrangement are suspended by virtue of law, (iv) the debtor/administrator
may not settle performances from the claims, which are covered by the arrangement when the proceedings
are pending (to some extend this rule does not apply to contractual compensation clauses (Polish: klauzula
_kompensacyjna))._

**_Arrangement proceedings_**

These proceedings are available only for the debtors, whose disputed claims exceed fifteen per cent of the
total claims held by creditors entitled to vote and, as a result, both types of previous proceedings cannot be
initiated.

291


-----

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for the acceptance and approval of the arrangement without
attaching the arrangement proposals. The debtor needs to demonstrate in the petition the probability of
settling by the debtor the costs of the proceedings and fulfilling liabilities which will arise after the
commencement of arrangement proceedings. In principle, the court issues a decision whether to accept
and approve the arrangement within two weeks from submitting the petition (this period may be extended
to six weeks, if it is necessary to conduct a trial).

The court also appoints a court supervisor (Polish: _nadzorca s˛adowy), who will supervise the debtor’s_
management of its assets and a judge-commissioner (Polish: _s˛edzia-komisarz), who will manage the_
restructuring proceedings and supervise the activities of the court supervisor and, if applicable, the
administrator (Polish: zarz˛adca).

The court may: (i) secure the debtor’s assets through the appointment of an interim court supervisor
(Polish: _tymczasowy nadzorca s˛adowy) for the period between the filing of the petition and the_
commencement of the proceedings, (ii) suspend pending enforcement proceedings conducted in order to
enforce claims covered with the arrangement and (iii) revoke the seizure of the debtor’s bank account at
the request of the debtor or the interim court supervisor. The debtor or the creditor who is in the course of
conducting the enforcement may lodge a complaint against the court’s decision to suspend pending
enforcement proceedings and to revoke the seizure of the debtor’s bank account. If the court decides to
revoke the seizure of the debtor’s bank account, it needs to appoint an interim court supervisor, who will
give consent to the debtor’s dispositions regarding the sums maintained on this bank account.

Within thirty days from the commencement of the arrangement proceedings, the court supervisor:
(i) prepares and submits to the judge-commissioner a restructuring plan and a list of claims, (ii) determines
the composition of the arrangement estate (Polish: _masa układowa) by preparing a specification of_
inventory (Polish: spis inwentarza) together with an estimation of the arrangement estate. Upon the receipt
of the restructuring plan and the list of claims, the judge-commissioner sets the date of the creditors’
meeting for the purpose of voting on the arrangement and informs the creditors of that date providing
them with (i) arrangement proposals, (ii) information on division of the creditors on the grounds of their
category of interests as well as on (iii) a manner of way of voting at the creditors’ meeting.

The debtor continues to manage its assets under the supervision of the court supervisor (optionally the
court may appoint an administrator to take over the management of the arrangement estate). The court
may revoke the debtor’s management if: (i) the debtor does not comply with the judge-commissioner’s
directions, (ii) its management does not guarantee the performance of the arrangement or (iii) its
management does not comply with the law (whether intentionally or not) to the detriment (actual or
potential) of the creditors.

In addition, once the arrangement proceedings are commenced, _inter alia: (i) execution proceedings_
relating to claims covered by the arrangement are suspended by virtue of law, (ii) the creditors may initiate
judicial, administrative or judicial-administrative proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts
(Polish: s˛ady polubowne) regarding satisfaction of claims disclosed in the specification of inventory, (iii) the
court supervisor accedes by virtue of law to pending judicial, administrative or judicial-administrative
proceedings or proceedings before arbitration courts regarding the arrangement estate.

**_Remedial proceedings_**

This type of proceedings is available only for insolvent debtors and provides for the broadest scope of
restructuring activities and protection against creditors. Unlike other types of restructuring proceedings, it
may be also initiated by the debtor’s personal creditor (Polish: _wierzyciel osobisty) or a trustee (Polish:_
_kurator), if appointed by the registry court._

The debtor prepares and submits a petition for commencing remedial proceedings. The debtor needs to
demonstrate in the petition the probability of settling by the debtor the costs of the proceedings and
fulfilling liabilities which will arise after the commencement of remedial proceedings. The court may
secure the debtor’s assets through the appointment of an interim court supervisor (Polish: _tymczasowy_
_nadzorca s˛adowy) or an interim administrator (Polish:_ _tymczasowy zarz˛adca) for the period between the_
filing of the petition and the commencement of the proceedings. In principle, the court issues a decision
whether to commence remedial proceedings within two weeks from submitting the petition (this period
may be extended to six weeks, if it is necessary to conduct a trial). The court appoints a judgecommissioner (Polish: s˛edzia-komisarz), who will manage the proceedings and supervise the activities of the
administrator (Polish: _zarz˛adca). The appointment of an administrator to manage the debtor’s estate_

292


-----

(remedial estate) is mandatory, unless the debtor’s involvement is necessary to conduct successful
restructuring and the debtor guarantees proper management (in which case the court may agree to the
debtor’s retaining management over the whole or a part of the undertaking).

Once the court issues the decision on the commencement of remedial proceedings, the debtor is obliged to
pass the whole estate and documents related thereto to the administrator (unless the debtor has been given
the right to manage its assets), and provide the judge-commissioner and the administrator with all
necessary or required information. Subsequently the administrator, in cooperation with the debtor, submits
a restructuring plan to the judge-commissioner within thirty days from the commencement of the
proceedings (this period may be extended to three months), who accepts and approves the restructuring
plan upon obtaining, the opinion of the board of creditors (Polish: _rada wierzycieli). After obtaining the_
approval, the administrator performs the restructuring plan.

In addition, once the remedial proceedings are commenced, _inter alia: (i) commercial power of attorney_
(Polish: prokura) and other powers of attorney granted by the debtor expire by virtue of law (in the course
of remedial proceedings new commercial power of attorney or powers of attorney may be granted by the
administrator), (ii) the administrator is granted the right to ‘‘cherry-pick’’ executory contracts (Polish:
_umowy wzajemne) which have not been performed in full or in part prior to the commencement date,_
subject to the judge-commissioner’s consent. (ii) the estate which enables the debtor to operate and the
debtor’s estate becomes the remedial estate (Polish: masa sanacyjna), whose components are determined
by the administrator by means of preparing a specification of inventory (Polish: spis inwentarza) together
with an estimation of the remedial estate (Polish: ustalenie składu masy sanacyjnej), within thirty days from
the commencement of the proceedings, (iii) it is possible to adjust the employment level to the needs of
the reorganized undertaking, (iv) opened inheritance to which the debtor is appointed, is included in the
remedial estate, (v) pending execution proceedings relating to remedial estate are suspended by virtue of
law, (vi) the creditors may initiate judicial, administrative or judicial-administrative proceedings or
proceedings before arbitration courts (Polish: s˛ady polubowne) which regard satisfaction of claims disclosed
in the specification of inventory, (vii) judicial, administrative or judicial-administrative proceedings or
proceedings before arbitration courts regarding the remedial estate may be initiated by or conducted
against the administrator, in such case the administrator acts in his/her own name but on behalf of the
debtor, (viii) at the request of the debtor, the judge-commissioner may revoke the seizure of elements
included in the remedial estate in the course of enforcement or proceedings aimed at securing claims
(Polish: post˛epowanie zabezpieczaj˛ace), if such elements are necessary for the debtor to operate.

Also, certain legal transactions are ineffective towards the remedial estate once the remedial proceedings
are commenced. These are: (i) transactions by means of which the debtor has disposed of its assets, if they
were concluded by the debtor within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement
of the remedial proceedings was submitted and the value of the debtor’s performance (Polish: ´swiadczenie)
significantly exceeds the value of the performance received by or reserved for the debtor, (ii) security
interests, which have been established indirectly in connection with receiving a performance by the debtor
within one year preceding the day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings
was submitted (iii) security interests, which have been established by the debtor within one year preceding
the day, on which the petition on commencement of the remedial proceedings was submitted in the part
such security interests exceed more than the half of the value of secured performance received by or
reserved for the debtor together with claims for ancillary claims on the day of establishing such security
interests. The above rules also apply to guarantees, suretyships (Polish: _por˛eczenia) and to other similar_
activities performed to secure performances.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests**

Comments made below are relevant for the Polish Guarantor, being the Polish limited liability company.

**_Governing law and enforceability_**

In the event of subjecting the Polish Guarantor’s Guarantees and Collateral to the laws of Germany in a
dispute before a Polish court, only substantive laws of Germany will be applied while the laws of procedure
will be governed by Polish law. Furthermore, as a rule, a Polish courts can refuse to apply or execute
foreign legal provisions, if the application of such provisions results in the contravention of peremptory
rules of Polish public policy, or if specific law has to be applied regardless of the choice of law (i.e., should
any rights in rem be involved, they will be subject to the laws of the country in which the subject of these
rights is located).

293


-----

As a general rule, the decisions of Polish courts become final and non- appealable after execution of
appropriate remedy path or after the expiry of the statutory term to file a remedy, subject to applicability
of extraordinary legal remedies if available.

The decisions issued by foreign courts, as the general rule, become enforceable in Poland after establishing
their enforceability by the Polish court. The Polish court may refuse to declare the enforceability of the
decision of the foreign court, _inter alia, if the decision is in contravention of peremptory rules of Polish_
public policy.

As a general rule, the decisions of the courts of other EU member states do not need to be declared
enforceable by the Polish courts, prior to their enforcement in Poland. Enforceability of these decisions
may be challenged, however, in a separate proceedings before the Polish court.

As a general rule, decisions of the Polish courts (including on issuance of enforceability clause) and
appropriate actions of enforcement officers with whom the enforcement of claims is sought may be,
depending on the circumstances, required for the enforcement of the given security interest.

**_Insolvency as a result of an excess of obligations over the value of the company’s assets_**

Obligations of the Polish Guarantor under the Notes and the Guarantees and Collateral are subject to
limitations resulting from the application of provisions of the Polish Bankruptcy Law.

Limited liability companies may be deemed insolvent if their financial obligations exceed the value of their
assets and this status continues for longer than twenty four months (except for future liabilities, including
liabilities subject to a suspensory condition, and shareholder loans or other legal act having the similar
effects). Nevertheless, even if the above conditions are met, the court may reject a bankruptcy petition,
provided that there is no threat to the debtor’s ability to perform its due and payable obligations in a short
term.

**_Actio Pauliana_**

Polish civil law provides a basis for declaring some actions done to the detriment of creditors ineffective
(so-called ‘‘actio Pauliana’’). In general, if as a result of a legal act performed by a debtor to the detriment
of creditors, a third party gains a financial benefit, each of the creditors may demand that the said act be
declared ineffective with respect to him, if the debtor acted knowingly to the creditors’ detriment, and the
third party knew or, having used due care, could have learned of it. This provision applies accordingly if the
debtor acts with an intention to harm future creditors. It is assumed that the debtor’s legal act is performed
to the creditors’ detriment if, as a result of such act, the debtor becomes insolvent or becomes insolvent to
a greater degree than he was before performing the act (as described in Supreme Court judgements Case
No. II CSK 548/11, Case No. III CSK 143/16, Case No. III CSK 214/11). The application to the court with
respect to ‘‘actio Pauliana’’ can be filed within five years from the date of the act.

**_Limitations resulting from the Polish Commercial Code_**

The Notes and the Guarantees and the grant of Collateral by the Polish Guarantor is also subject to certain
provisions of the Polish Commercial Companies Code (Polish: _Kodeks Sp´ołek Handlowych) of_
September 15, 2000 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2019, item 505, as amended) (the ‘‘Polish
**Commercial Companies Code’’). With respect to the limited liability company (Polish: sp´ołka z ograniczon˛a**
_odpowiedzialno´sci˛a, sp. z o.o.) pursuant to the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the creation of a_
limited right in rem over the enterprise or over its organized part requires a resolution of the shareholders
under the pain of invalidity.

Pursuant to Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code, the shareholders may not receive,
under any title, any payments from the Polish limited liability company’s assets needed to fully cover the
share capital of this company. A breach of this rule results in the shareholders’ obligation to return the
payments up to the amount of the share capital. Therefore, the liability of any Guarantor incorporated
under Polish law on account of payments under the Notes and the Guarantees and Collateral should be
limited, in particular, to the extent that it would result in a reduction of its assets necessary to cover in full
its share capital in breach of Article 189 § 2 of the Polish Commercial Companies Code.

If a share pledge is enforced and the shareholder changes, a new ‘‘relation of domination’’ might arise. In
such case the new shareholder would be obliged to notify the dependent company, _i.e., the Polish_
Guarantor, of this fact. Otherwise, its right to vote from its shares representing more than 33% of the share

294


-----

capital of the dependent company will be suspended. A new relation of domination might also arise if
under a pledge agreement, the pledgee gains a majority of the votes at the general meeting of the Polish
Guarantor. The corresponding notification duty has to be fulfilled by the pledgee.

**_Interests limitation_**

Pursuant to Article 359 § 2[1] in conjunction with § 2 of the Act of 23 April 1964 Civil Code (consolidated
text: Journal of Laws of 2018, item 1025, as amended) (the ‘‘Civil Code’’), the maximum interest resulting
from the legal act, i.e. so-called ‘‘capital interest’’ (Polish: _odsetki kapitałowe) cannot per annum exceed_
double statutory interest (i.e. double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank
of Poland and (ii) 3.5 percentage points). As of the date of this memorandum, the maximum capital
interest amounts to 10%.

In addition, according to the Article 481 § 2[1] in conjunction with § 2 of the Civil Code, the maximum
interest resulting from a delay (Polish: _odsetki za op´o´znienie) cannot per annum exceed double statutory_
interest for delay (i.e. double of the sum of: (i) the reference rate published by the National Bank of
Poland and (ii) 5.5 percentage points). As of the date of this memorandum, the maximum interest for delay
amounts to 14%.

Should the value of interest exceed the value of relevant maximum interest, then relevant maximum
interest is due. Contractual provisions cannot exclude or limit the provisions on maximum interest. The
above mentioned specific provision of Polish law shall be applied by a Polish court irrespective of the fact
that the parties have chosen foreign law to govern the transaction (overriding mandatory provisions).

**_Clearance from the President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers in order to execute_**
**_some rights over shares_**

An exercise of voting rights in the Polish Guarantor by the holder of the relevant security under a power of
attorney may be recognized as a change of control pursuant to the Act on Protection of Competition and
Consumers of February 16, 2007 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2019, item 369, as amended) (the
‘‘Competition Law’’). Art. 14 of the Competition Law provides with exceptions, when the clearance from the
President of the Polish Office for Protection of Competition and Consumers (the ‘‘President of UOKiK’’),
is not required. Among others, the notification is not required, when an entity acquires or takes up, on a
temporary basis, stocks and shares with a view to securing debts, provided, however, that such entity does
not exercise the rights arising from these stocks or shares, except for the right to sell.

Thus, the holder of such security may be obliged to notify the President of UOKiK about its intention to
exercise its voting rights and to obtain prior antimonopoly clearance as the enforcement of a registered
pledge through the appropriation of the shares by the Security Agent may be recognized as a notifiable
concentration under the Competition Law.

**_Perfection requirements_**

Generally, under Polish law, for a valid and effective establishment of security interests certain perfection
requirements need to be fulfilled, including the requirements specified below.

The registered and financial pledges over the shares in the Polish Guarantor may be validly established
only after fulfillment of the certain perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper
registered pledge agreement must be executed, the registered pledge must be registered in the register of
pledges maintained by the competent court and will become effective vis-`a-vis the Polish Guarantor once it
is notified of the establishment of such pledge; (ii) the proper financial pledge agreement must be executed
and will become effective vis-`a-vis the Polish Guarantor once it is notified of the establishment of such
pledge, (iii) the pledges should be disclosed in the book of shares of the Polish Guarantor. Additional
formal requirements are to be complied with.

The registered pledges over the assets may be validly established only after fulfillment of the certain
perfection requirements including the following: (i) the proper pledge agreement must be executed and
(ii) the registered pledge must be registered in the register of pledges maintained by the competent court.

The mortgage may be validly established only after fulfillment of the certain perfection requirements
including the following: (i) an agreement in a form of a notarial deed must be executed, (ii) the mortgage
must be registered in the land and mortgage register and takes effect as of the date on which the motion to
register the mortgage was filed with the court.

295


-----

The agreement of the security assignment of a thing, receivable or of other right (even if governed by
non-Polish law) is effective towards the bankruptcy estate (as defined by the Bankruptcy Law), if it was
executed in writing with a certified date (i.e., e.g. a date certified by a Polish notary).

In principle, a secured creditor can enforce its security once the secured claim becomes mature (that is, the
debt becomes due and payable). Under certain circumstances, the creditor must obtain a final and
non-appealable court decision and enforcement clause before enforcing its security. A less formal
procedure is possible, for example, if the claim is secured by registered or financial pledge and the pledge
agreement provides that the creditor can take over the pledge object.

**_Parallel debt structure under Polish law_**

In majority of cases, under Polish law security interests cannot be granted to a party other than the creditor
of the secured claim. Generally, under Polish law, the pledge or mortgage is strictly accessory and follows
the debt or claim it secures and may not be transferred without such debt or claim. If such debt or claim is
transferred without the pledge or mortgage, the latter will expire.

For that reason, in certain transactions, also in Poland, a parallel debt structure is used, whereby the
guarantor, as a separate and independent obligation governed by non-Polish law, undertakes to pay to the
security agent amounts equal to the amounts due by it to the other creditors. Such parallel debt structure,
therefore, creates a separate and independent claim of the security agent that can be validly secured by a
security interest. Consequently, the security interests are granted to the security agent in its own capacity as
a creditor acting in its own name pursuant to the parallel debt, and not as a representative of the creditors.
It is usually expressly agreed in such parallel debt agreement that the obligations of the debtor towards the
security agent shall be decreased to the extent that the corresponding principal obligations to the creditors
are reduced (and vice versa).

The Supreme Court issued the judgments on October 9, 2009 (Case No. IV CSK 145/09, Case No. IV
CSK 169/09 and Case No. IV CSK 155/09) concerning the effectiveness of establishing security interests
over the assets of the debtor of parallel debt. In the above cases, the Supreme Court has not challenged the
validity of a foreign law parallel debt structure, however, such structure was only indirectly referred to in
the above judgments. As there is no doctrine of ‘‘precedence’’ under Polish law, uncertainty exists as to
validity and enforceability of the parallel debt under Polish law.

As Polish law does not recognize the concept of ‘‘trust’’ or ‘‘trustee’’, it is uncertain how the Security Agent
will be treated by a Polish court.

**CZECH REPUBLIC**

One of the Guarantors is a private limited liability company (spoleˇcnost s ruˇcen´ım omezen´ym) incorporated
under the laws of the Czech Republic (the ‘‘Czech Guarantor’’). Consequently, in the event of insolvency
of the Czech Guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in the Czech Republic, and would then be
governed by Czech Insolvency laws.

In principle, insolvency proceedings with respect to a Czech company should be based on the Czech
insolvency laws. Nevertheless, under the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a Czech company conducts
business in another Member State of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the Czech courts may be
limited if the company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is found to be in a Member State other than the Czech
Republic.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Under the Act No. 182/2006 Coll., the Insolvency Act, as amended (the ‘‘Czech Insolvency Act’’),
insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor (Czech Guarantor) or by any of its creditors in
the event of the insolvency (´upadek) in the form of the over-indebtedness (pˇredluˇzen´ı) of the debtor or
inability to meet the debtor’s obligations (platebn´ı neschopnost). A debtor is insolvent in the form of
inability to meet its obligations if it has at least two creditors and has monetary obligations more than
30 days after their due date which it is unable to satisfy. A debtor is deemed unable to pay its monetary
obligations if (i) it has suspended payments of a substantial portion of its monetary obligations, (ii) it is in
default with payment of its monetary obligations for more than three months, (iii) it is not possible to
satisfy some of the due receivables against the debtor by means of a court enforcement of decisions (v´ykon
_rozhodnut´ı) or distrait (exekuce), or (iv) the debtor fails to submit to the relevant Czech court solving the_
debtor’s insolvency requested lists of its assets, obligations and employees. However, the debtor who is an

296


-----

entrepreneur and keeps accounting books is deemed able to fulfill its monetary obligations if (i) the
difference between its due monetary obligations and its disposable resources (the ‘‘gap coverage’’) as
stated in the report on its cash position amounts to less than one tenth of its due monetary obligations or if
(ii) the report on development of its cash projection evidences that the gap coverage will descend below
one tenth of its due monetary obligations during the period of that projection. Both reports are to be
prepared by an auditor, expert or other certified consultant in line with the requirements by applicable
laws.

A debtor is over-indebted if it has at least two creditors and its total liabilities exceed the value of its assets
(taking into account further administration of the debtor’s assets and/or further operation of its business if
it is likely that the debtor will be able to further administer its assets and/or conduct its business). However,
since there is no clear guidance as how to calculate the value of a debtor’s assets, in some cases it may be
rather difficult to determine whether the debtor meets the over-indebtedness criterion and the views of the
debtor and its creditors may vary in this regard.

In addition, the debtor may also file an insolvency petition in case of imminent insolvency (hroz´ıc´ı ´upadek),
_i.e., if it may be reasonably expected with regard to all circumstances that the debtor will not be able to_
perform a substantial part of its monetary obligations duly and on time.

Insolvency proceedings are commenced upon the entitled person filing the insolvency petition (insolvenˇcn´ı
_n´avrh) to the relevant insolvency court, which is then published by the court in the publicly available_
insolvency register. The insolvency court is allowed to postpone the publication of the insolvency petition
immediately after its filing if it has been filed by debtor’s creditor and the court doubts reasonably the
legitimacy of such petition until the final decision about its legitimacy has become effective. The most
substantial effects of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings in respect of a debtor are the
following:

   - the debtor’s creditors may not seek their claims or other rights concerning the insolvency estate by a
legal action (ˇzaloba) if they can lodge their claims in the insolvency proceedings by means of a
lodgment of claims (pˇrihl´aˇska pohled´avky);

  - a security interest relating to the assets owned by the debtor or other assets belonging to the
insolvency estate may be created or realized (uplatnit) only pursuant to the statutory conditions of
the Czech Insolvency Act;

   - court enforcement of decisions or distrait that would affect the assets owned by the debtor or other
assets belonging to the insolvency estate may be ordered, but may not be generally performed; and

   - the debtor is generally prohibited from making disposals of the insolvency estate and assets which
may belong to it if it might substantially change the structure, use or determination of such assets or
which might cause a non-negligible reduction of such assets.

The relevant insolvency court is entitled to order protective measures to secure the property of the debtor
before it issues its decision on the debtor’s insolvency.

Furthermore, no later than within seven days (in case of an insolvency petition filed by the debtor) after
the filing of the insolvency petition or within 15 days (in case of an insolvency petition filed by the debtor’s
creditor) after the delivery of the insolvency petition by the insolvency court, the debtor may file a petition
for a moratorium with the insolvency court unless the debtor is being liquidated. However, the written
consent of the majority of its creditors (counted on the basis of the amount of claims of the respective
creditors) and the latest financial statements of the debtor must be attached to such a petition for a
moratorium. The court may declare a moratorium of up to three months. The duration of the moratorium
may be further prolonged by the court upon the debtor’s request with the updated list of obligations and
with the written consent of the majority of its creditors (counted on the basis of the amount of claims of the
respective creditors) for another 30 days.

Depending on the method of resolution of the debtor’s insolvency, the creditors who have submitted their
claim in the insolvency proceedings have different rights and possibilities to influence the insolvency
proceedings. This is effectuated via the creditors’ bodies:

   - the assembly of creditors (sch˚uze vˇeˇritel˚u); and

   - the committee of creditors (vˇeˇritelsk´y v´ybor) or representative of creditors (z´astupce vˇeˇritel˚u).

297


-----

The assembly of creditors comprises all creditors who have submitted their claims in the insolvency
proceedings. The competence of the assembly of creditors includes, among other things, replacement of
the court-appointed insolvency administrator with an insolvency administrator appointed by the assembly
of creditors, election of the committee of creditors (representative of creditors) and decision on the
method of resolution of the debtor’s insolvency. Furthermore, the assembly of creditors may in principle
reserve for itself any matter that falls within the competence of the creditors’ bodies. Those creditors who
are persons related to the debtor (osoba bl´ızk´a) or persons belonging to the same group of companies
(koncern) as the debtor are not allowed to vote at the meeting of the assembly of creditors (besides few
exceptions stated in the Czech Insolvency Act).

The committee of creditors supervises the activity of the insolvency administrator, grants its consent to the
conclusion of debtor-in-possession financing agreements (´uvˇerov´e financov´an´ı) to the debtor or the
insolvency administrator (as applicable), is entitled to make proposals to the insolvency court relating to
the course of the insolvency proceedings, etc. The committee of creditors comprises at least 3 and at most
7 members; the number depends on the resolution of the assembly of creditors. In the event that not more
than 50 creditors have lodged their claims in the insolvency proceedings or if the method of resolving the
insolvency is negligible bankruptcy (nepatrn´y konkurs), the assembly of creditors is not obligated to elect
the committee of creditors and may instead elect a representative of creditors and his/her substitute. If the
number of members of the committee of creditors falls below 3 or below the majority, the scope of the
committee of creditors is exercised by the insolvency court itself until the confirmation of the new election
or the additional election of the members of the committee of creditors.

The Czech Insolvency Act provides for different priorities of claims. Generally, the claims lodged in the
insolvency proceedings are subject to formal review process conducted in front of the insolvency court
(pˇrezkumn´e jedn´an´ı) where each of the insolvency administrator, the debtor and other creditors who have
lodged their claims may challenge the existence (validity) or the amount of a claim registered by a creditor
as well the existence (validity) of the security interest securing the claim. Should the claim be challenged,
an incidental dispute within the insolvency proceedings is commenced that will be decided by the
insolvency court. If the challenge is successful, the claim, the amount thereof or the security interest will
not be ascertained in the insolvency proceedings. Moreover, that creditor may face severe monetary
penalties as set forth by the Czech Insolvency Act.

The insolvency court is obliged to take steps leading to the decision on the insolvency of the debtor within
10 days after the filing of the insolvency petition. In case of the insolvency petition submitted by the debtor,
the insolvency court is obliged to decide on the petition 15 days after the submission thereof at the latest. If
the debtor’s insolvency or imminent insolvency is evidenced or proven in the insolvency proceedings, the
court shall issue a decision declaring the debtor’s insolvency. In this decision, the court, among other
things, (i) appoints an insolvency administrator (insolvenˇcn´ı spr´avce) which is to dispose of the debtor’s
assets to the extent to which the debtor is prohibited from doing so, (ii) requests the creditors which have
not yet lodged their claims to do so within a time period of 2 months and (iii) request the debtor to file a
list of his estate and all his debtors and creditors. The court however may not issue a decision declaring the
debtor’s insolvency during the moratorium.

Should the insolvency petition be filed by a creditor, then such a creditor (besides few exceptions stated in
the Czech Insolvency Act) is obliged to pay the deposit covering costs of insolvency proceedings in amount
of CZK50,000.00 (in case of the debtor being a legal person—entrepreneur) or CZK10,000.00 (in all other
cases). As an expression of the electronisation process of the insolvency proceedings the petition must be
filed by electronic means. Also the communication towards the majority of parties in the insolvency
proceeding, is made generally only by a public notice made by the insolvency court published in the online
insolvency register.

Furthermore, the creditor filing the insolvency petition has to prove that he has a due and payable claim
against the debtor, and has to attach to the petition an application for registration of the claim. If the
petitioner is a legal entity that keeps books of accounts or tax records, it is in principle obliged to
substantiate the claim by means of the debtor’s acknowledgment of debt with authenticated signature, or
by means of an enforceable judgment, or a notarial deed with an enforceability consent clause, or an
enforcement officer’s deed with an enforceability consent clause, or a confirmation by an auditor, courtappointed expert or tax adviser to the effect that the claim is reflected in the petitioner’s accounting books.

The insolvency court might order on the ground of a motion submitted by another participant of the
insolvency proceeding or by the insolvency administrator that the creditors who are foreign legal entities or
foreigners with their usual residence abroad are obliged to deposit a security (jistota) to cover costs of the

298


-----

insolvency proceedings or to compensate damages emerging from their participation in the insolvency
proceedings to other participants. Provided these creditors fail to obey the order, their lodgment of claims
shall not be taken into account. However, this rule does not apply on those creditors (i) who are citizens or
foreign legal entities from a Member State of the European Union or from another state of European
Economic Area, or (ii) who own a real estate in the Czech Republic with the sufficient value to ensure the
aim of a security or (iii) whose home country does not require such security from Czech nationals.

Depending on the facts of the case, the insolvency court should adopt a decision on the method of
resolution of the debtor’s insolvency either along with the decision on the debtor’s insolvency or no later
than three months after the issuance of the decision on the debtor’s insolvency. The Czech Insolvency Act
provides for two methods of resolution of a debtor’s insolvency applicable to entrepreneurs, namely
bankruptcy liquidation (konkurs) and reorganisation (reorganizace).

**_Bankruptcy liquidation_**

In principle, bankruptcy liquidation procedure is a method of resolution of a debtor’s insolvency in which
the insolvency estate is liquidated and the claims of the creditors are generally satisfied proportionately
from the proceeds of such liquidation. Accordingly, upon the declaration of bankruptcy liquidation, the
right to dispose with the insolvency estate and thus the management of the debtor’s enterprise is conveyed
to the insolvency administrator.

A declaration of bankruptcy liquidation renders ineffective (i) all easements created in favor of creditors
under strikingly disadvantageous conditions after the effects of the commencement of the insolvency
proceedings occurred and (ii) security interests relating to the assets belonging to the insolvency estate
created after the effects of the commencement of the insolvency proceedings occurred unless created in
accordance with the strict conditions of the Czech Insolvency Act. Furthermore, executory contracts
entered into by the debtor and requiring mutual performance which have not been fully performed by both
the debtor and the other party to the contract (smlouvy o vz´ajemn´em plnˇen´ı) may be generally either
assumed or rescinded by the insolvency administrator.

Claims against the insolvency estate (e.g. for remuneration and reimbursement of costs of the insolvency
administrator, the members of the committee of creditors and the finance office regarding tax deduction
correction) and certain other claims (e.g. employment-related claims of the debtor’s employees) are
satisfied preferentially in their full amount at any time after the insolvency court passes a decision
declaring the debtor’s insolvency. In addition to that, creditors whose claims are secured (zajiˇstˇen´ı vˇeˇritel´e)
are separately satisfied in their respective rank from the achieved proceeds of sale of the asset (after
deduction of the remuneration of the insolvency administrator and costs of the administration and sale, but
in principle not more than 9% from the proceeds of sale of the asset) on which the security was established
and are entitled to make instructions to the insolvency administrator to the course of its realization and
administration. However, should a housing unit be sold during liquidation of the insolvency estate and
should a person responsible for administration of the concerned house lodge a claim relating to such
administration, then such a claim is to be satisfied prior to satisfaction of secured creditors’ claims (up to a
maximum of one tenth of the sale proceeds). Claims of unsecured creditors are satisfied pari passu from
the proceeds of liquidation of the insolvency estate on the basis of the distribution resolution (rozvrhov´e
_usnesen´ı) issued by the insolvency court. Subordinated claims and claims of debtor’s shareholders arising as_
a result of their participation in the company may only be satisfied if all of the claims to which the
insolvency proceedings relate have already been satisfied in full.

As a general rule, claims or parts thereof which were not satisfied in the insolvency proceedings do not
cease to exist after the termination of the insolvency proceedings. However, the bankruptcy procedure in
principle leads to the dissolution of the debtor as a legal entity, and thus the unsatisfied claims or their
parts cease to exist as result of the dissolution of the legal entity.

**_Reorganization_**

In the reorganization procedure, the creditors’ claims are satisfied gradually as the debtor further operates
its enterprise whereas measures aiming at rescue of the debtor’s business are taken pursuant to the
reorganization plan (reorganizaˇcn´ı pl´an) approved by the insolvency court. As a principle, upon the court’s
decision approving the reorganization becoming final and binding, the restrictions on the debtor’s right to
dispose with its assets expire. However, the debtor is entitled to enter into legal acts with substantial impact
on the insolvency estate only with the consent of the committee of creditors.

299


-----

However, the reorganization procedure is only available if all of the below mentioned conditions are
satisfied:

(a) the debtor is an entrepreneur (which is met in case of the Czech Guarantor);

(b) the debtor is not a legal entity in liquidation, a securities trader, or an entity entitled to trade on the
commodity exchange; and

(c) the debtor’s annual total net turnover for the last accounting period preceding the filing of the
insolvency petition reached at least the amount of CZK50,000,000 or the debtor employs at least 50
employees in an employment relationship (pracovn´ı pomˇer).

The condition under letter (c) does not apply if the debtor, no later than the date on which the court issued
a decision declaring the debtor’s insolvency, submits a reorganization plan accepted by at least half of the
creditors whose claims are secured (zajiˇstˇen´ı vˇeˇritel´e) and at least half of all unsecured creditors (nezajiˇstˇen´ı
_vˇeˇritel´e) (in both cases counted on the basis of the amount of claims of the respective creditors). If the_
insolvency petition is filed by the debtor’s creditor and the debtor submits the respective request to the
insolvency court before the declaration of insolvency, the debtor may, however, submit a reorganization
plan accepted by its secured and unsecured creditors as stated above within the period of up to additional
thirty days following the declaration of the debtor’s insolvency. The insolvency court cannot, however,
order reorganization if the assembly of creditors opts for bankruptcy liquidation pursuant to the relevant
provisions of the Czech Insolvency Act. Moreover, in order to finally order the reorganization plan,
statutory conditions relating to the approval thereof must be fulfilled.

**_Hardening Periods and Voidable Transactions_**

In the event that insolvency proceedings with respect to the Czech Guarantor were governed by Czech law,
certain transactions by the Czech Guarantor, including the provision of the Guarantee, could be
potentially challenged by an insolvency administrator by means of a legal action (ˇzaloba) under the rules
relating to voidable transactions as set out in the Czech Insolvency Act if concluded or performed during
the ‘‘hardening periods’’.

Generally, the insolvency administrator may challenge legal acts by means of which the debtor curtails the
satisfaction of its creditors or by means of which the debtor favors certain creditors over the others
(whereas the term legal act also covers omissions). In particular, the insolvency administrator may
challenge the effectiveness (´uˇcinnost) of the following legal acts of the debtor against the insolvency
administrator, the creditors and the insolvency estate:

(a) legal acts without reasonable consideration, _i.e., legal acts under which the debtor undertook to_
provide performance for no consideration or for consideration with a usual value substantially lower
than the usual value of the debtor’s performance, if they were undertaken during the debtor’s
insolvency or which rendered the debtor insolvent (whereas in case of legal acts in favor of a person
related to the debtor (osoba bl´ızk´a) or a person belonging to the same group of companies (koncern)
as the debtor it is up to such person to provide evidence that the legal acts were not undertaken during
the debtor’s insolvency);

(b) preferential legal acts, i.e., legal acts as a result of which a creditor receives a higher satisfaction than it
would receive in the bankruptcy liquidation procedure to the detriment of other creditors, in case they
were undertaken during the debtor’s insolvency or which rendered the debtor insolvent (whereas in
case of legal acts in favor of a person related to the debtor or a person belonging to the same group of
companies as the debtor it is up to such person to provide evidence that the legal acts were not
undertaken during the debtor’s insolvency), whereas such preferential legal acts may, in particular,
include legal acts:

  - by which the debtor paid its debt before it became due;

  - under which the debtor agreed upon a modification or replacement of its obligation, to its own
detriment;

  - under which the debtor waived the performance of its receivable towards another debtor or
otherwise agreed upon or enabled the cessation or the non- performance of its right; and

  - under which the debtor provided its assets to secure an already existing obligation (unless the
security interest is established as a result of changes in the internal content of a pledged compound
thing).

300


-----

(c) intentionally fraudulent legal acts, _i.e., legal acts by which the debtor intentionally curtails the_
satisfaction of a creditor provided that the other party to the legal act knew or with regard to all
circumstances must have known about such debtor’s intention (whereas in case of legal acts in favor of
a person related to the debtor or a person belonging to the same group of companies as the debtor it
is up to such person to provide evidence that the person did not know about the debtor’s intention).

The insolvency administrator may, in one year period commencing from the legal effects of the court’s
decision on the debtor’s insolvency, challenge the effectiveness of the legal acts without reasonable
consideration and preferential legal acts which were taken during (i) the last three years prior to the
commencement of the insolvency proceedings if they were undertaken to the benefit of a person related to
the debtor or a person belonging to the same group of companies as the debtor, or (ii) in the last year
preceding the commencement of the insolvency proceedings in all other cases. The effectiveness of the
intentionally fraudulent legal acts may be challenged if they were undertaken during the last five years
prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings.

In the event that the insolvency administrator successfully challenges the effectiveness of a legal act
undertaken by the debtor, the persons to the benefit of which such ineffective legal act was undertaken or
which benefited from the ineffective legal act are obligated to give up the performance from such legal act
to the benefit of the insolvency estate.

**_Limitation on Enforcement of the Guarantee_**

In order to ensure that the Czech Guarantor does not violate the Czech rules on financial assistance or
certain insolvency limitations by providing a guarantee, it is standard practice for indentures, credit
agreements and guarantees to contain ‘‘limitation language’’ in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in the
Czech Republic.

Accordingly, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Czech Guarantor subject to certain exceptions including
those which if incurred, directly or indirectly, would result in the violation of financial assistance rules
arising from Section 41 and 200 of Act No. 90/2012 Coll., as amended (the Act on Business Corporations).

Furthermore, the guarantees provided by the Czech Guarantor may be subject to additional limitations
limiting the amount of guaranteed obligations to the extent that is economically and operationally
justifiable for a Czech Guarantor. Such limitation may, without limitation to, mitigate a risk of assessment
of the guarantee by the insolvency administrator as a favoring legal act.

For completeness, upon the commencement of insolvency proceedings in respect of the Czech Guarantor,
creditors from the Guarantee will not be able to seek the direct enforcement of the obligations of the
Czech Guarantor arising under the Guarantee and will need to submit their claim in such insolvency
proceedings initiated in respect of the Czech Guarantor.

**UNITED KINGDOM**

Progroup Board Ltd. is incorporated in England. Provided that the place where this company (the
‘‘English Guarantor’’) conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties is situated within England, an English court may conclude that the English
Guarantor has its center of main interests, within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) (the ‘‘EU
**Insolvency Regulation’’), in England. On this basis, ‘‘main insolvency proceedings’’ (within the meaning of**
article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in respect of the English Guarantor may be commenced in
England. Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a company incorporated under English law has
its ‘‘center of main interests’’ in a Member State of the European Union other than the United Kingdom
or Denmark, then the main insolvency proceedings for that company will be opened in the Member State
in which its center of main interests is located and be subject to the laws of that Member State, subject to
certain carve outs. For further information, please see ‘‘—European Union’’. Similarly, the Cross-Border
Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency
in England and Wales, provide that a foreign (i.e. non-English) court may have jurisdiction where any
English company has its center of main interests in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an
‘‘establishment’’ (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out
non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). To the extent that the CrossBorder Insolvency Regulations 2006 conflict with an obligation under the EU Insolvency Regulation, the
requirements of the EU Insolvency Regulation will prevail.

Following a national referendum in June 2016, the United Kingdom exercised its right pursuant to
Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union to initiate a process to withdraw from the European
Union. Please note that the information contained in this section will be subject to change in light of the
arrangements to be put in place to effect the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. As
such arrangements have not yet been determined, this section outlines the relevant insolvency law
considerations in England and Wales as of the date of this offering memorandum.

**Applicable insolvency proceedings: administration and liquidation**

For these purposes, the applicable insolvency regimes under English law are administration and
liquidation. Administration is a flexible procedure, the primary purpose of which is the rescue of the
company as a going concern (the other purposes are set out below). In contrast, liquidation will result in
the winding up of the company. The English legal regime (which is principally set out in the Insolvency Act
1986, as amended (the ‘‘UK Insolvency Act’’) and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016
(together with the UK Insolvency Act, (the ‘‘UK Insolvency Legislation’’)) that would apply in the event of
any insolvency proceedings of the English Guarantor may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency
laws of other jurisdictions with which creditors may be more familiar.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways.
The company or a creditor may apply to court for the making of an administration order in respect of the
company or the company itself or certain secured creditors may appoint an administrator to the company
using an out of court process. Broadly speaking (and subject to specific conditions), a company can be
placed into administration at the application of, among others, the English Guarantor itself, its directors or
one or more of its creditors (including contingent and prospective creditors). A holder of a qualifying
floating charge over the assets of the English Guarantor also has the right to appoint an administrator. In
addition, he has the right to intervene in an application made for administration proceedings by another
person by nominating an alternative administrator or, in certain very specific circumstances, by blocking
the appointment altogether by the appointment of an administrative receiver.

If the English Guarantor grants a ‘‘qualifying floating charge’’ to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court
and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must,
unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the UK
Insolvency Act as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of
administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be
created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to
empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the UK Insolvency Act. A
party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if
necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of
the relevant English company and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The
most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exception relating to ‘‘capital market arrangements’’ (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), which may
apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50 million for the relevant company during the life
of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ‘‘capital markets investment’’ (which is
defined in the UK Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument, and debt
instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

Liquidation proceedings can be opened by a creditor filing a petition with a court to wind up the company
(a ‘‘compulsory winding up’’) or the company’s resolving to do so in a general meeting of shareholders (a
‘‘voluntary winding up’’). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed
into administration if it is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its debts, (or, in the case of an appointment
by the holder of a qualifying floating charge, if the relevant charge has become enforceable) and the
administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory purposes. A company is unable to pay
its debts if it is insolvent either on a ‘‘cash-flow’’ or ‘‘balance-sheet’’ basis. In broad terms, a company is
cash-flow insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; a company is balance-sheet insolvent if
the value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and
prospective liabilities.

The administration of a company must achieve one of the following statutory objectives: (i) the rescue of
the company (as distinct from the business carried on by the company) as a going concern (the primary

302


-----

objective); (ii) the achievement of a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be
likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration) (the second objective); or
(iii) the realization of some or all of the company’s property to make a distribution to one or more secured
or preferential creditors (the third objective). An administrator must attempt to achieve the statutory
objective of the administration process in the order set out above: unless he thinks either that it is not
reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary objective would achieve a
better result for the company’s creditors as a whole, he must try to achieve the primary objective.
Moreover, the administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless he thinks that it is not reasonably
practicable to achieve either the first objective or the second objective and that it will not unnecessarily
harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective.

Liquidation is a procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and distributed by the
liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the UK Insolvency Legislation. At the
end of the liquidation process, the company will normally be dissolved.

For the Holders of the Notes, indirectly benefiting from the Guarantee and security interests granted by
the English Guarantor, the most important consequences of the opening of formal insolvency proceedings
in England and Wales against the English Guarantor would be that:

  - the appointed insolvency practitioner (an administrator or liquidator) would have the right to
administer and dispose of the assets of such English Guarantor as the representative of the
insolvent estate;

  - in certain circumstances, an administrator or a liquidator will have powers to challenge the
Guarantee and security interests granted by the English Guarantor and potentially certain
intercompany obligations entered into by the English Guarantor; and

  - in general terms, the Holders of the Notes could only pursue their claims against the English
Guarantor in accordance with the provisions in the UK Insolvency Legislation.

The principal factors to be aware of are as follows.

**Stay on proceedings**

Broadly speaking, an interim moratorium comes into effect when an application for an administration
order (in the case of court appointment) or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator is made and,
when an administrator is appointed, a full statutory moratorium applies. Whilst there are a few exceptions,
save where the court or (in the case of a full statutory moratorium) the administrator consents, that
moratorium prevents creditors taking any action against the company to recover their debts including,
among other things, commencing or continuing any legal process against the company, winding up the
company, enforcing security or repossessing goods in the company’s possession under a hire purchase or
similar agreement. However, certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their
security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the
disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’ (generally, a
charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments
and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (as amended)
(the ‘‘Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations’’).

Equally, the court’s making of an order for the winding-up of an English company brings into effect a stay
on the commencement or continuation of any court proceedings against it (although security enforcement
is not stayed). There is no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding up. Where a liquidation is
commenced by the shareholders of an English company, the liquidator will usually apply to court for a stay
on the continuation of any ongoing legal proceedings. Again though, creditors’ rights to enforce their
security are not affected.

Subject to the above points, were the English Guarantor to enter administration, it is possible that the
security granted by it may not be enforced while it is in administration. Similarly, whilst any principal debt
or guarantee obligation owed by it would be accelerated or demanded, no meaningful enforcement action
could be taken in respect of any failure to pay.

Administrators may dispose of property that is subject to a floating charge without the consent of the
relevant charge holder, which will have the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal as it
had in respect of the property disposed of. With the prior approval of the court, an administrator can
dispose of property subject to a fixed charge without the consent of the relevant secured creditor, provided

303


-----

that: the disposal is likely to promote the administration’s purpose; and the administrator applies the net
proceeds from the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company
to the secured creditor.

**Priority of claims in UK insolvency proceedings**

In the liquidation of the English Guarantor or its administration (where the relevant administrator makes
a distribution), the insolvent company’s assets will be realized and distributed to its creditors. Creditors are
placed into different classes and, with the exceptions and adjustments noted below, the proceeds from the
realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in a descending order of priority, as set out below.
With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions cannot be made to a class of
creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been repaid in full. Unless creditors
have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a _pari passu basis, that is, the cash is distributed in_
proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

   - First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in
specific assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the company but
only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the value of the
asset in which they have a proprietary interest.

  - Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency
proceedings (there is a further statutory order of priority setting out the order in which those
expenses are paid);

  - Third ranking claims: preferential debt, which includes (but is not limited to) contributions to
occupational and state pension schemes, employment claims (wages and salaries of employees for
work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person and
holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination
takes place before or after the insolvency date);

   - Fourth ranking claims: holders of floating charge security to the extent of the realizations from
those secured assets according to the priority of their security. However, before distributing such
asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part must, subject to certain
exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

   - Fifth ranking claims: general

     - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and secured creditors to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination
agreements in place between any of them). To pay the secured creditors any unsecured
shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as
secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part in respect of a
shortfall unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

     - secondly, statutory interest that arises on debts after the insolvency at the higher of the
applicable contractual rate and a statutory rate; and

     - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above
are fully paid; and

   - Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company,
provided that it is in the process of being wound up.

It is anticipated that new legislation will, in the case of insolvencies commencing on or after April 6, 2020,
confer secondary preferential creditor status on HMRC in respect of taxes collected and held by businesses
on behalf of HMRC (for example, PAYE income tax and VAT).

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the
subordination.

The UK Insolvency Legislation broadly provides that in a liquidation of a company, where the assets
available for payment of its general creditors (excluding any amount ring-fenced for unsecured debts as

304


-----

described above) are not sufficient to meet the liquidation expenses, certain specified liquidation expenses
can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes,
rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’ claims.

In the case of litigation expenses exceeding £5,000, this is subject to rules restricting the application of this
provision to certain litigation expenses approved by the floating chargee and any preferential creditors or
the court. Consequently, realizations by secured creditors upon the enforcement of floating charges
securing any principal or guarantee obligation to the Holders could potentially be reduced by the amount
of any liquidation expenses. If any fixed security is validly created, any claims of creditors holding such
fixed security would rank ahead of any such liquidation expenses. The creditors holding the security would,
however, pay the expenses of realizing their security directly to the liquidator or other person (such as a
receiver or security trustee) who disposed of the secured assets on their behalf.

Broadly speaking, expenses that qualify as expenses of the administration (and which include, among
others, expenses properly incurred by the administrator in performing his functions in the administration
and necessary disbursements incurred in the course of the administration) enjoy priority status, in a similar
way to liquidation expenses (as described above) although the categories of expenses are slightly different.
In particular, expenses of the administration can be claimed out of the realization proceeds of assets
subject to a floating charge and, for these purposes, rank ahead of preferential debts and floating chargees’
claims.

**Prescribed Part**

An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of an insolvent company will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of assets subject to
floating charge security for the benefit of the company’s unsecured creditors (the ‘‘Prescribed Part’’).
Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating charge realizations and 20% of the
remainder over £10,000, and the Prescribed Part is subject to a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000. The
Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be
disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available to satisfy
any shortfall claims of secured creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured
creditors. Whether the assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute
substantially the whole of the English Guarantor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced
will be a question of fact at that time.

**Recharacterization of fixed security interests**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the
security documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description
given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be
upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on
whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the English Guarantor’s ability to deal
in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the holder of
the security in practice. Where the English Guarantor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of
a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely
to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be
described as a fixed charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to
attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed
security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its
discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as
floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the English Guarantor in respect of
that part of the English Guarantor’s net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing
under ‘‘Prescribed Part’’ above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the English
Guarantor may have priority over the rights of the Security Agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such
security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank
ahead of the claims of the Security Agent as floating charge holder.

305


-----

**Challenges to Guarantees and Collateral**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of a
guarantee or security interest can be challenged. In most cases this will only arise if an administrator or
liquidator is appointed to the company within a specified period (as set forth in more detail below) of the
granting of the guarantee or security interest and, in addition, if the company was ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’
when the guarantee or security interest was granted or became ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as a result of
granting the guarantee or security interest. A company will be ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ if it is proved to the
court’s satisfaction that the company is not able to pay its debts as they fall due or that the value of the
company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (taking into account its contingent and prospective
liabilities). Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, a statutory demand for over £750 is
served on the company and remains unsatisfied for three weeks or the company has failed to secure or
compound for it to the reasonable satisfaction of the relevant creditor within such period, or if any
execution against or other court process issued in respect of a court judgment debt in favor of a creditor is
returned unsatisfied in whole or in part. If the Guarantee or any security interest granted by the English
Guarantor is challenged under the laws of England and Wales, and the court makes certain findings (as
described further below), the court may:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of the English Guarantor’s obligations under the Guarantee or
security interests provided by it;

  - direct that the Holders of the Notes return any amounts paid to them by the English Guarantor
under the Guarantee, either directly to the English Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the
English Guarantor’s creditors generally; and/or

  - take other action that may be detrimental to the Holders of the Notes.

The following potential grounds of challenge may apply to the Guarantee and/or security interests given by
the English Guarantor under the UK Insolvency Act:

**Transaction at an Undervalue**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a guarantee granted or Collateral provided by the company (or give other relief) on the
grounds that the creation of such guarantee or provision of Collateral constituted a transaction at an
undervalue. The grant of a guarantee or provision of Collateral will only be a transaction at an undervalue
if the company either receives no consideration in return for the guarantee or provision of Collateral, or
receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given
by it. For a challenge to be made, the guarantee must be granted or the Collateral must be provided within
a period of two years ending with the onset of the company’s insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the
UK Insolvency Act). The onset of insolvency is the date on which the first of the following occurs: an
administrator is appointed, an application for an administration order is made to court, notice of intention
to appoint an administrator through an out of court process is filed at court, a winding up petition is
presented at court or a shareholders’ resolution to wind up is passed.

In addition the company must either be ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ when it grants the guarantee or provides
the Collateral or become ‘‘unable to pay its debts’’ as a result. Even if these tests are satisfied, a court will
not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered
into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did
so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this,
if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, it will make such order as it
thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into
(which could include reducing payments under the relevant guarantee or setting it or the provision of
Collateral aside). In any challenge proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that
the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction is a ‘‘connected
person’’ of the English company (as defined in the UK Insolvency Act), in which case there is a
presumption that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and the connected person
must demonstrate that the company was in fact solvent.

**Preference**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of a company could apply to the court for an
order to set aside a guarantee or security interest granted by such company (or give other relief) on the

306


-----

grounds that such guarantee or security interest constituted a preference. The grant of a guarantee or
security interest will be a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the
company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the guarantee or
security interest had not been granted. The company must either have been unable to pay its debts at the
time of the transaction or become so unable as a result of the transaction. A challenge can only be made if
the guarantee or security interest was granted within the period of (i) six months ending with the onset of
insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the UK Insolvency Act—see above) if the beneficiary of the
guarantee or security interest is not a connected person or (ii) if the beneficiary is a connected person of
the English company, two years ending with the onset of insolvency. A court should not make an order that
a preference has been granted unless it is satisfied the company was influenced in deciding to enter into
the relevant transaction by a desire to put the relevant creditor in a better position in the event of the
company’s liquidation. Case law suggests there must be a desire to prefer one creditor over another and
not just other commercial motives even if they had the inevitable result of producing the better position.
Moreover, a company can only grant a preference to an existing creditor. If the Holders of the Notes only
become creditors of the English Guarantor at the same time as they subscribe for the Notes and become
creditors of the Issuer and it is a condition of their subscribing for the Notes that such guarantees or
security interest are granted, it is very unlikely that any question of preference should arise. Subject to this,
if the court determines that the transaction was a preference, it will make such order as it thinks fit to
restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include
reducing payments under the guarantees or setting them or any security interests aside). In any
proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was unable
to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless
the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the
company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must
demonstrate in such proceedings that there was in fact no such influence.

**Transaction Defrauding Creditors**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company, or a person who is a victim of
the relevant transaction (with leave of the court if the company is in liquidation and a moratorium on
creditor action is in place with respect to that company, or if the company is in administration), could apply
to the court for an order to set aside a guarantee or Collateral on the grounds that the guarantee or
provision of Collateral was a transaction defrauding creditors. A transaction will constitute a transaction
defrauding creditors if it satisfies the criteria for being a transaction at an undervalue (see above) and the
court is satisfied that the substantial purpose of the company in entering into the transaction was to put
assets beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against the company or to prejudice the interests
of such persons in relation to their actual or potential claim.

If the court determines the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, it may make such order as it
sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into or
protect the interests of the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or
setting it or the Collateral aside). Such an order may not prejudice any interest in property that was
acquired from a third party in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances or
require a third party who received a benefit from the relevant transaction that acted in good faith, for value
and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum, unless he was a party to the relevant
transaction. Any ‘‘victim’’ of the transaction may (with the leave of the court if the company is in
liquidation or administration) apply to court under this provision and not just the liquidator or
administrator of the relevant company. There is no time limit in the English insolvency legislation within
which the company must enter insolvency proceedings for this ground of challenge to be available
(although general statutory limitation periods will apply) and the relevant company does not need to be
unable to pay its debts at the time or as a result of the relevant transaction for a challenge under this head
of claim to be made out.

**Extortionate credit transactions**

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or an administrator of a company could apply to court to set
aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can review extortionate credit transactions entered into
by the English Guarantor up to three years before the day on which the English Guarantor entered into
administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is ‘‘extortionate’’ if, having regard to the risk
accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly

307


-----

exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the
provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

**Floating charges capable of being set aside**

The UK Insolvency Act provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by an English
company during the ‘‘relevant time’’ will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid
to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant
English company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the
‘‘Consideration’’). In the case of a floating charge which is created in favor of a person that is not
connected to the English Guarantor, the relevant time is deemed to be the period of 12 months ending
with the onset of the English Guarantor’s insolvency provided that at the time the charge was granted the
English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts or became unable to pay its debts as a result of the
transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted.

If the floating charge is created in favor of a person connected to the English Guarantor, the relevant look
back time is a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency and there is no requirement that at
the time the charge was granted the English Guarantor was unable to pay its debts or became unable to
pay its debts as a result of the transaction in respect of which the floating charge was granted.

Accordingly, in the event that the English Guarantor becomes unable to pay its debts within a period of up
to two years of the issuance of the Notes, any floating charge created during the relevant time period will
be automatically invalid, except to the value of the Consideration. An administrator or liquidator (as
applicable) will not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by
operation of law. However, if the floating charge qualifies as a ‘‘security financial collateral arrangement’’
under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations, the floating charge will not be void as described
in this paragraph.

**Dispositions after Winding-Up**

Any disposition of the English company’s property which is made after the compulsory winding-up of the
company has commenced is void, unless the court orders otherwise. The compulsory winding-up of a
company is deemed to start when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company,
rather than the date on which the court makes the winding-up order (if any).

If a company is the subject of (i) a statutory moratorium as a result of either entering administration or
(ii) the small companies moratorium, and either (x) the holder of security created by that company (other
than financial collateral as above described) consents or (y) if the court gives leave, the relevant company
or its administrator may dispose of the secured property as if it were not subject to the security. In
addition, an administrator can dispose of assets subject to a floating charge without seeking the consent of
the chargeholder or the leave of the court. Where the property in question is subject to a security which
was created as a floating charge, the chargee will have the same priority in respect of any property of the
company directly or indirectly representing the property disposed of as he would have had in respect of the
property subject to the security. Where the security in question is other than a floating charge, it shall be a
condition of the chargee’s consent or the leave of the court that the net proceeds of the disposal shall be
applied towards discharging the sums secured by the security.

**Equitable share charge**

The fixed charges over shares in companies incorporated in England and Wales granted by a Guarantor
are equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor transfers the
beneficial interest in the shares to the chargee but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to
equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

**Foreign Currency**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts,
any debt of a company payable in a currency other than British pounds (such as euros in the case of the
Notes) must be converted into British pounds at a single rate for each currency determined by the officeholder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing at the relevant date. If a creditor considers the rate to
be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

308


-----

**Account banks’ right to set-off**

With respect to the charges over cash deposits (each an ‘‘Account Charge’’) granted by the English
Guarantor over any of its bank accounts, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an
‘‘Account Bank’’) may hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallization event
under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their
cash pooling or other arrangements with that English Guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted
over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank
accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to
the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallized
and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency
events with respect to the relevant English Chargor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of
that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights,
since the Account Bank will only be entitled to exercise its netting and set-off rights until such time as it is
informed that the beneficial interest in the debt represented by the account credit balance has been
transferred to a third party.

**Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Notes Guarantees and Collateral**

Independent of provisions of UK insolvency law, the grant of a Guarantee and provision of Collateral by
the English Guarantor in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal
requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the company’s memorandum and
articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the
grant of the Guarantee or provision of Collateral can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s
rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with the company
in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further,
corporate benefit must be established for the company in question by virtue of entering into the proposed
transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he
considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its
members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial
benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may vulnerable to
being set aside by a court.

**Schemes of Arrangement**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a
compromise or arrangement between a company and its creditors (or classes of creditors) where such
company is liable to be wound-up under the UK Insolvency Act. In order for a scheme of arrangement
proposed by a non-UK company to be sanctioned by the English courts, the relevant company must also
have a ‘‘sufficient connection’’ to the English jurisdiction.

In previous cases, a sufficient connection has been found to be satisfied by the English courts where,
among other things: the relevant company has assets situated in England or carries on business there; its
‘‘center of main interests’’ is in England; and/or it owes liabilities to creditors based in England or under
agreements governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and
circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the
second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote at a
creditors’ meeting on the proposed compromise or arrangement in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights
that such creditors are to be granted under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company
or its creditors. The scheme will be passed at the creditors’ meeting if a majority in number representing
75% or more in value of those creditors present and voting at each of the creditors’ meeting(s) vote in
favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance
documents, and that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors,
including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote on the scheme and those who voted
against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the
court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the
discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made to the scheme or reject the scheme.

309

**Company Voluntary Arrangements**

Pursuant to Part I of the UK Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator as applicable)
may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails
a compromise of the company’s unsecured debts. The company may propose whatever compromise they
consider appropriate in accordance with the duties of the directors or administrator (as applicable) and,
provided that compromise is approved by the requisite majority of creditors, it will bind all unsecured
creditors of the company who were entitled to vote or would have been entitled to vote had they had notice
of the meeting.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement to be passed, it must be approved by both: (a) 75% or
more in value of the creditors present and voting at the creditors’ meeting called to approve the
arrangement; and (b) 50% in value of the creditors that are unconnected with the company.

**Small Companies Moratorium**

Certain ‘‘small companies’’ may, for the purposes of putting together proposals for a company voluntary
arrangement, seek court protection from their creditors by way of a moratorium for a period of up to
28 days, with the option for creditors to extend this protection for up to a further two months (although the
Secretary of State may, by order, extend or reduce the duration of either period). A ‘‘small company’’ is
defined for these purposes by reference to whether the company meets certain criteria relating to a
company’s balance sheet, total turnover and average number of employees in a particular period (although
the Secretary of State may, by order, modify the moratorium eligibility qualifications and the definition of
a ‘‘small company’’). The position as to whether or not a company is a ‘‘small company’’ may change from
financial period to financial period, depending on its financial position and average number of employees
during that particular period. Accordingly, the English Guarantor may, at any given time, come within the
ambit of the ‘‘small companies’’ provisions, such that the English Guarantor may (subject to the
exemptions referred to below) be eligible to seek a moratorium, in advance of a company voluntary
arrangement.

During the period for which a moratorium is in force in relation to a small company, among other things,
no winding up may be commenced (except in very limited circumstances, for example where the Secretary
of State considers it to be in the public interest to do so) or administrator or administrative receiver
appointed to that company, no security created by that company over its property may be enforced (except
(i) with the leave of the court or (ii) in the case of existence of eligible financial collateral arrangements
under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations whereby the requirement to get a court order
before enforcing security over small companies will not apply), no other proceedings or legal process may
be commenced or continued in relation to that company (except with the leave of the court) and the
company’s ability to make payments in respect of debts and liabilities existing at the date of the filing for
the moratorium is curtailed. Certain small companies may, however, be excluded from being eligible for a
moratorium (although the Secretary of State may, by regulations, modify such exclusions). This
moratorium is also not available to companies which have entered into certain capital market
arrangements (whereby the company has incurred or is expected to incur a debt of at least £10 million and
the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment) as detailed in Schedule A1 to the UK
Insolvency Act. The definitions of ‘‘capital market arrangement’’ and ‘‘capital market investment’’ are
broad and are such that, in general terms, any company which is a party to an arrangement which involves
at least £10 million of debt, the granting of security to a trustee, and the issue of a rated, listed or traded
debt instrument, is excluded from being eligible for this small companies moratorium.

**TAXATION**

**CERTAIN GERMAN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding and_
_disposal of the Additional Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax_
_considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Additional Notes, and, in particular, does not_
_consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on_
_the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this offering memorandum, which are_
_subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

_The law as currently in effect provides for a flat tax rate (flat tax regime; Abgeltungsteuer) for certain investment_
_income and, in particular, interest income. There is an ongoing discussion in Germany whether the reduced tax_
_rate should be increased or abolished so that investment income would be taxed at higher rates. It is still unclear_
_whether, how and when the current discussion may result in any legislative changes._

_Prospective purchasers of the Additional Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Additional Notes, including the effect of any state,_
_local or church taxes, under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which they are resident or whose tax_
_laws apply to them for other reasons._

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing payments, such as interest payments, received by an individual holder of the Additional Notes will
be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Additional Notes are kept or administered
in a custodial account with a German financial institution (i.e., a bank, a financial services institution, a
securities trading company or a securities trading bank (each, a ‘‘Disbursing Agent’’, auszahlende Stelle)).
The term German financial institution includes a German branch of a foreign financial institution but not a
foreign branch of a German financial institution. The withholding tax rate is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge
at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%). If the individual holder is subject to
church tax, a church tax surcharge will also be withheld. The church tax surcharge is automatically withheld
by the Disbursing Agent, unless the holder notifies the Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt f¨ur
_Steuern) that it objects to automatic withholding. In this case, the holder will be assessed to church tax (if_
applicable).

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition) and interest accrued on the Additional
Notes (‘‘Accrued Interest’’, St¨uckzinsen) derived by an individual holder irrespective of any holding period
provided the Additional Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since
the time of their acquisition. If Additional Notes held or managed in the same custodial account were
acquired at different points in time, the Additional Notes first acquired will be deemed to have been sold
first for the purposes of determining any capital gains. The separation of interest claims from the
Additional Notes is treated as disposition of the Additional Notes at their fair market value which has to be
apportioned to the capital and the interest strips. If interest claims or interest coupons are disposed of
separately (i.e., without the Additional Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding
tax. The same applies to proceeds from the redemption or collection of interest claims or interest coupons
if the Additional Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Additional Notes have not been kept in a custodial account with the same Disbursing
Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total
withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds (including
interest accrued on the Additional Notes (‘‘Accrued Interest’’, _St¨uckzinsen), if any), unless the current_
Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Additional Notes
by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank or financial services institution within the
European Union, the European Economic Area or certain other countries, e.g., Switzerland.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis of
the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Additional
Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception of shares).
The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Additional Notes or other securities paid
separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to

311


-----

certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on
investment income in a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial
account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing Agent,
the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of A801 (A1,602 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die
_Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of tax to be_
withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax will be deducted
if the holder of the Additional Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of non assessment
(Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax office.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Additional Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including via a
commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain legal
forms the status of corporation has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax office) while
ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are generally subject to withholding tax (irrespective of any
deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same applies where the Additional Notes form part of a
German trade or business (of an individual or a commercial partnership) subject to further requirements
being met.

Interest and capital gains on the Additional Notes received by non-residents of Germany are, in general,
not subject to German withholding tax or the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or
capital gain is subject to German taxation (as set forth under ‘‘—Taxation of Current Income and Capital
_Gains—Non Tax Residents’’) and the Additional Notes are held in a custodial account with a Disbursing_
Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded
based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable double taxation treaty
(Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection ‘‘—Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose
residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management is located in Germany).

Income (i.e. interest and capital gains) derived under the Additional Notes held by an individual holder
who is tax resident in Germany, irrespective of any holding period, is in general subject to German income
tax at a flat tax rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon)
(Abgeltungsteuer) if the Additional Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). Individual
holders who are tax resident in Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer—
_Pauschbetrag) of_ A801 (A1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered
partnership law (Gesetz ¨uber die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred
higher expenses directly attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is a tax resident in Germany on income from
capital investments under the Additional Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld. To the
extent withholding tax has not been levied, such as in the case no Disbursing Agent being involved in the
payment process, the individual holder must include his or her income and capital gains derived from the
Additional Notes in his or her tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity
surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the
actual gain), an individual holder may, and in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal
proceeds, must apply for an assessment on the basis of his or her actual acquisition costs. Further, an
individual holder may apply for a tax assessment on the basis of general rules applicable to him or her if
the resulting individual income tax burden is lower than 25% with any amounts of German tax
over-withheld being refunded. The deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized
basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with respect to the Additional Notes may only be offset with
investment income of the individual holder realized in the same or following assessment periods.

Pursuant to a tax decree issued by the German Federal Ministry of Finance on January 18, 2016 (as
amended) a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall) and a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht), to the
extent that the waiver does not qualify as a hidden capital contribution, shall not be treated as a disposal.

312


-----

Accordingly, losses suffered upon such bad debt loss or waiver are not tax deductible if the Notes are held
as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen). The same rules should be applicable according to the said tax
decree, if the Additional Notes expire worthless so that losses may not be tax-deductible at all. With
respect to a bad debt loss in the private wealth sphere (private Verm¨ogenssph¨are), the German Federal
Fiscal Court (German Federal Fiscal Court decision dated 24 October 2017—VIII R 13/15) has objected
the view of the German tax authorities and decided that a finally suffered bad debt loss is tax deductible.
Parts of the tax administration (cf. Regional Tax Authority North Rhine-Westphalia, Brief Information
Letter dated 23 January 2018) do not apply the German Fiscal Court decision beyond the decided
individual case. Further decisions in this context are currently still pending with the German Federal Fiscal
Court. In addition, in a recently published decision by the German Federal Fiscal Court with regard to
losses incurred in connection with knock-out certificates due to the fact of exceeding the knock-out
threshold the German Federal Fiscal Court took the view that such a case (i.e., no payments from the day
of exceeding the knock-out threshold) shall be treated similar to a bad debt loss as a sale at the value zero,
so that losses suffered shall also be deductible for tax purposes (German Federal Fiscal Court decision
dated 20 November 2018—VIII R 37/15). It remains unclear if and to what extent the German tax
authorities will change their position as currently published with respect to the treatment of capital losses.
Moreover, the tax authorities previously recognized losses suffered from a sale of a capital investment only
if the proceeds received from the sale exceeded the respective transaction costs. Based on the decision of
the German Federal Fiscal Court (German Federal Fiscal Court decision dated 12 June 2018—VIII
R 32/16) the tax authorities have changed their position. According to a recent decree issued by the
German Federal Ministry of Finance on May 10, 2019, losses resulting from a sale of a capital investment
should be recognized irrespective of the amount of the sales proceeds or transaction costs.

According to the recently published draft bill of the German Federal Ministry of Finance
(Referentenentwurf des Bundesministeriums der Finanzen) for an annual Tax Act 2019 (Jahressteuergesetz
_2019) dated 8 May 2019 the view of the German tax authority on the non-deductibility of capital losses for_
tax purposes in the scenarios described above are proposed to be provided for in the German Income Tax
Act.

Where Additional Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or where the
income from the Additional Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the
withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is
subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax
thereon). Where Additional Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued Interest)
and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder will have to include income
and related (business) expenses in the tax return and the balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax
rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against the personal or corporate
income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability,
will be refunded. Where Additional Notes form part of a German trade or business the current income and
capital gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes may also be
subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax liability depends on the municipal trade tax
factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the
trade tax may be completely or partly credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax
credit method.

_Non Tax Residents_

This subsection ‘‘—Non Tax Residents’’ refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany
(i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management is not
located in Germany).

Interest, including accrued interest, and capital gains (which include currency gains and losses, if any) from
the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Additional Notes received by holders who are
not tax resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Additional Notes
form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or
a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source
income (e.g., such as income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real
estate (unless the Additional Notes qualify as global notes (Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of
Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibung) or income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs real estate or
income from profit participating instruments). Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in

313


-----

Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an
over-the-counter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Additional Notes are not held in
custody with the same German Disbursing Agent. To the extent the German source income is subject to
German withholding tax, this withholding tax is, in general final and the German tax liability is satisfied by
the tax withheld. Where the German source income is not subject to German withholding tax or in case
(i) of this paragraph (i.e., if Additional Notes form part of the business property of a German permanent
establishment), a tax regime similar to that explained above under ‘‘—Tax Residents’’ applies. Subject to
certain requirements, a holder who is not tax resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax
exemptions provided by an applicable double taxation treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen) and German
tax law.

**_Bond Premium_**

If the Additional Notes are held as private investment (Privatverm¨ogen) and if a German holder purchases
an Additional Note for an amount (not including any amount paid for pre-issuance accrued interest) that is
greater than the principal amount of the Additional Note, the bond premium is part of the acquisition
costs which are deducted from the proceeds upon the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of
the Additional Notes.

According to a circular issued by the Regional Tax Authority Frankfurt dated February 5, 2019, German
holders, holding the Additional Notes as their trade or business assets (Betriebsverm¨ogen) could be obliged
to create a deferred item (Rechnungsabgrenzungsposten) in the amount of the bond premium which is to be
dissolved linearly over the term of the Additional Note. Moreover, under certain circumstances, the
German Holder may amortize (wholly or partly) a bond premium before disposal, redemption, repayment
or assignment of the Additional Notes.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Additional Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German
inheritance or gift tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the
transfer a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany or in certain cases for German citizens who
previously maintained a residence in Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or
deemed to be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will be
levied if the Additional Notes qualify as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibung) unless the Additional Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for
which a permanent establishment or fixed base is maintained or a permanent representative has been
appointed in Germany.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Additional Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, except for any notarial
fees). However, under certain conditions, entrepreneurs (for VAT purposes) may opt for a liability to value
added tax with regard to the sale of Additional Notes which would otherwise be tax exempt. Currently, net
assets tax (Verm¨ogensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**The Proposed Financial Transaction Tax (FTT)**

The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial transactions
tax (‘‘FTT’’) in certain EU Member States. The Commission proposal is currently subject to review. The
proposed FTT has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in the form of the proposal, apply to certain
dealings in the Additional Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Member States with respect to the exact
form and the timing. It may therefore be altered prior to any potential implementation.

Besides the proposed FTT, some jurisdictions (e.g., Italy and France) have already introduced a domestic
financial transaction tax that may apply to certain dealings in the Securities in certain circumstances. Other
jurisdictions may also introduce a domestic financial transaction tax.

Prospective holders of the Additional Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to
the FTT and domestic financial transaction taxes.

**International Exchange of Information**

Based on the ‘‘OECD Common Reporting Standard’’ states, which have committed themselves to apply
the OECD Common reporting Standards (participating states), exchange information with respect to
financial accounts held per person in another participating state. The same applies to EU Member States.
Based on the extended Mutual Assistance Directive 2011/16/EC (amended by Directive 2014/107/EC) EU
Member States exchange information with respect to certain reporting accounts of persons domiciled in
another EU Member State. Prospective investors of the Additional Notes are advised to seek their own
professional advice on further development.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes. This discussion is limited to U.S. holders
(defined below) who purchase the Additional Notes in this Offering at the price indicated on the cover
page of this offering memorandum and hold the Additional Notes as capital assets within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the United States Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’). The following
discussion does not address certain considerations that may apply to particular holders including, but not
limited to, tax-exempt entities, holders subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax, U.S.
expatriates, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market
method of accounting, certain financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies,
partnerships or other pass-through entities (or investors in such entities), U.S. holders whose ‘‘functional
currency’’ is not the U.S. dollar and persons who hold the Additional Notes in connection with a
‘‘straddle’’, ‘‘hedging’’, ‘‘conversion’’ or other risk reduction transaction. This discussion does not address
the tax considerations relevant to holders of the Additional Notes under any state, local or non-U.S. tax
laws or any other tax laws other than the U.S. federal income tax laws, or the consequences to taxpayers
subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code. Further, this discussion does not
address the U.S. tax consequences relating to the redemption of the Floating Rate Notes.

The discussion below is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (‘‘Treasury
**Regulations’’), court decisions, revenue rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal**
Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) currently in force, all as of the date of this Offering, and all of which are
subject to change or changes in interpretation. Prospective investors should particularly note that any such
change or changes in interpretation could have retroactive effect so as to result in U.S. federal income tax
consequences different from those discussed below. Consequently, prospective investors should consult
their tax advisors as to the consequences of holding the Additional Notes.

As used herein, the term ‘‘U.S. holder’’ means a beneficial owner of Additional Notes that is for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation (or any other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state or political subdivision
thereof or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

  - a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons control all of the substantial decisions of
the trust or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is an owner of the Additional
Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder of the Additional Notes that is a partnership and
partners in such partnership should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of holding and disposing of the Additional Notes.

**Prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax**
**consequences to them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Additional Notes, including the tax**
**consequences under any state, local, non-U.S. and other tax laws.**

**Characterization of the Additional Notes**

In certain circumstances (see ‘‘Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the
_Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a Change of Control’’) we may be obligated to make_
payments on the Additional Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. If (i) the exercise of the
Issuer’s option to redeem the Additional Notes is not remote and (ii) it is not significantly more likely than
not that no Change of Control will occur, the Additional Notes could be treated as contingent payment
debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We intend to take the position that the foregoing
contingencies should not cause the Additional Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments. This position is binding on a holder unless such holder discloses its contrary position in the
manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder
would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payments at the time such
payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Additional Notes
were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest
income at a rate higher than their yield to maturity, to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain,
any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement or redemption of such an Additional Note, and to
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to such income. This disclosure assumes that
the Additional Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged
to consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Additional Notes of the
contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

The issuance of the Additional Notes should be treated as a ‘‘qualified reopening’’ of the Existing Notes
issued on March 27, 2018. Therefore, the Additional Notes issued in this offering should be treated as
having the same issue date and the same issue price as the Existing Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

**Interest**

Except as noted below with respect to pre-issuance accrued interest, payments of stated interest (including
any amounts withheld and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on
payments on the Additional Notes) on an Addition Note generally will be includible in the gross income of
a U.S. holder as foreign source ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued,
depending on the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and, for
purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income).

A U.S. holder of an Additional Note that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest will be required to include in ordinary income the
U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the ‘‘spot rate’’ on the date such payment is
received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. A cash method U.S.
holder will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment, but may have
exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros so received.

A U.S. holder of an Additional Note that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, will be required to include in
ordinary income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income in euros that has accrued with
respect to an Additional Note during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such accrued income will
be determined by translating such income at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or,
with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate for the partial
period within each taxable year. Alternatively, an accrual basis holder may make an election (which must
be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the
accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year, in the case of
an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that
date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of an Additional Note
that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange
gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount of
exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro
payment received (translated at the ‘‘spot rate’’ on the date such payment is received) in respect of such
accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued during such accrual period (as
determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. Such exchange

316


-----

gain or loss will generally constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes,
as U.S. source income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income and
expense.

**Pre-Issuance Accrued Interest**

A portion of the purchase price paid for the Additional Notes will be allocable to unpaid stated interest
that has accrued prior to the date the Additional Note is purchased (the ‘‘pre-issuance accrued interest’’).
As a result, a portion of the interest received on the first interest payment date equal to the pre-issuance
accrued interest may be treated as a return of the pre-issuance accrued interest and not as a payment of
interest on the Additional Notes (except that a U.S. holder generally would be required to recognize
exchange gain or loss, as discussed above, in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar value of the pre-issuance accrued interest at the time of purchase and at the time the payment of
such pre-issuance accrued interest is received, as determined at the spot rate in effect on each such date).
Amounts treated as a return of pre-issuance accrued interest will not be taxable when received but should
reduce the adjusted tax basis in the Additional Notes by such amount. U.S. holders should consult their
independent tax advisors regarding any pre-issuance accrued interest.

**Amortizable Bond Premium**

If a U.S. holder purchases an Additional Note for an amount (not including any amount paid for
pre-issuance accrued interest, as discussed above) that is greater than the principal amount, the holder will
be considered to have purchased the Additional Note with amortizable bond premium equal in amount to
the excess of the purchase price over the principal amount. Subject to certain exceptions and the limitation
discussed in the following paragraph, a U.S. holder may elect to amortize this premium, as an offset to
stated interest over the remaining term of an Additional Note, using a constant yield method, over the
remaining term of the Additional Note. A U.S. holder making this election must generally use any
amortizable bond premium allocable to an accrual period to offset stated interest required to be included
in income with respect to the Additional Note in such accrual period. U.S. holders are urged to consult
their tax advisors regarding the availability of the deduction for amortizable bond premium. A U.S. holder
who elects to amortize bond premium must reduce his tax basis in the Additional Note by the amount of
the premium amortized in any year. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt
obligations then owned and thereafter acquired by the holder and may be revoked only with the consent of
the IRS.

U.S. holders will generally compute amortizable bond premium in euros. A U.S. holder making the
election to amortize bond premium may recognize exchange gain or loss each period equal to the
difference between the U.S. dollar value of bond premium with respect to such period determined on the
date the interest attributable to such period is received and the U.S. dollar value of such amortized bond
premium determined on the date of the acquisition of the Additional Notes.

The Additional Notes are subject to call provisions at our option at various times. As a result, a U.S. holder
will calculate the amount of amortizable bond premium based on the amount payable on an applicable call
date if the use of the call price and the call date results in a smaller amortizable bond premium for the
period ending on the call date. In the event that we do not exercise our call rights on such call date, the
Additional Note generally should be treated as reissued on the call date for the call price, and the U.S.
holder will recalculate the amount of any amortizable bond premium on such Additional Note pursuant to
the principles described above. The foregoing rules may eliminate, reduce or defer any amortization
deductions.

**Foreign Tax Credit**

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss above, interest income (including any amounts withheld
and any Additional Amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes imposed on payments on the Additional
Notes) on an Additional Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally will be
considered ‘‘passive category income’’ in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under
U.S. federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to
such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. If a U.S. holder does not meet a minimum holding
period with respect to the Additional Notes during which the holder is not protected from risk of loss, such
holder generally will not receive a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the

317


-----

Additional Notes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. The calculation of foreign tax
credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances.
U.S. holders should consult their independent tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.

**Sale and Disposition of the Additional Notes**

Upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note, a U.S. holder generally will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than
amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which, to the extent not previously included in
income, and unless it represents pre-issuance accrued interest, will be taxable as ordinary interest income
in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above and exchange gain or
loss on such accrued and unpaid interest) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Additional Note.
A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Note generally will equal the U.S. dollar cost of the
Additional Note to the holder decreased by any bond premium previously amortized on the Additional
Note, and excluding any amount attributable to pre-issuance accrued interest (as described above) and
decreased by any principal payments previously received by such U.S. holder with respect to such
Additional Note.

The cost of acquiring an Additional Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price on the
date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. The amount realized on the sale,
exchange or other disposition of an Additional Note for an amount of euros will be the U.S. dollar value of
that amount on (i) the date payment is received in the case of a cash basis U.S. holder, (ii) the date of
disposition in the case of an accrual basis U.S. holder, or (iii) the settlement date (if the Additional Note is
traded on an established securities market) in the case of a cash basis U.S. holder (and, if it elects, an
accrual basis U.S. holder). If the Additional Note is traded on an established securities market, a U.S.
holder will have a tax basis in the euro received equal to the U.S. dollar value of such amount on the
settlement date. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described in this paragraph, the election
must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the
consent of the IRS.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of an
Additional Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates relating to the principal thereof
will be ordinary income or loss and will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value
of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Additional Note in euros (decreased by any amortizable bond
premium amortized by the U.S. holder and the amount of any pre-issuance accrued interest to the extent
that payment of such interest is treated as a nontaxable return of such pre-issuance accrued interest),
determined on the date of the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the
U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Additional Note (decreased by any amortizable bond premium
amortized by the U.S. holder and the amount of any pre-issuance accrued interest to the extent that
payment of such interest is treated as a nontaxable return of such pre-issuance accrued interest), in euros
determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Additional Note. In addition, a U.S. holder may
recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to amounts of previously accrued interest based on the
difference between the rate of exchange at which the interest was included in income and the applicable
rate of exchange at which the holder is required to translate euros at the time the Additional Note matures
or is otherwise disposed of. The foregoing foreign exchange gain or loss will be recognized only to the
extent of the total gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the
Additional Note, and will generally be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss for U.S. foreign tax
credit limitation purposes.

Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the
sale, exchange or other disposition of an Additional Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss
and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Additional Note has been held for more than one year at
the time of the sale or other disposition. In the case of an individual U.S. holder, any such long-term
capital gain generally will be subject to preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if that U.S. holder
satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
significant limitations.

**Receipt of Euros**

The tax basis of any euros received by a U.S. holder generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the euros
at the spot rate of exchange on the date the euros are received. Upon any subsequent exchange of euros

318


-----

for U.S. dollars, a U.S. holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of U.S. dollars received and the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euros. Upon any
subsequent exchange of euros for property (including non-U.S. currency), a U.S. holder generally will
recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euros
exchanged for such property based on the U.S. dollar spot rate of exchange for euros on the date of the
exchange and the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the euros so exchanged. Any such exchange gain or loss
generally will be treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**Reportable Transactions**

Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS including, in
certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of an Additional Note or
foreign currency received in respect of an Additional Note to the extent that such sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition results in a foreign currency tax loss in excess of a threshold
amount. If investors fail to timely file a required disclosure under these rules, substantial penalties can
apply. Potential investors should consult with their own tax advisors to determine the tax return
obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Additional Notes.

**U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**

Payments of interest and proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of an Additional Note
may be reported to the IRS unless the holder establishes a basis for exemption. Backup withholding may
apply to amounts subject to reporting if the holder fails to timely provide an accurate taxpayer
identification number or fails to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on its U.S. federal
income tax returns. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. A holder can claim a credit against its U.S.
federal income tax liability for the amount of any backup withholding and a refund of any excess.

**Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets**

Certain owners of ‘‘specified foreign financial assets’’ with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000 (and
in some circumstances, a higher threshold), will generally be required to file an information report on IRS
Form 8938 with respect to such assets with their U.S. federal tax returns. ‘‘Specified foreign financial
assets’’ include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the
following, but only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained by financial
institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-United States persons, (ii) financial instruments and
contracts that have non-United States issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in foreign entities. Such
reporting requirement may also apply to certain non-individual holders. Holders are urged to consult their
tax advisors regarding the application of this reporting requirement to their ownership of Additional
Notes.

**Medicare Tax**

Certain U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds
will be subject to an additional 3.8% Medicare tax on some or all of such U.S. holder’s ‘‘net investment
income’’. Net investment income generally includes interest on, and gain from the disposition of, the
Additional Notes unless such interest income or gain is derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a
trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). U.S.
holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect this tax may have, if any, on their acquisition,
ownership or disposition of Additional Notes.

319


-----

**CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS FOR ERISA AND OTHER PLAN INVESTORS**

**General**

Subject to the following discussion, the Notes may be acquired by an ‘‘employee benefit plan’’ as defined in
Section 3(3) of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (‘‘ERISA’’) that is
subject to Title I of ERISA, a ‘‘plan’’ as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code (including
individual retirement accounts) or an entity deemed to hold ‘‘plan assets’’ within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
Section 2510.3-101 (as modified by Section 3 (42) of ERISA) of the foregoing (each, a ‘‘Benefit Plan
**Investor’’), as well as by governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), church plans (as**
defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) or other plans that are not subject to the foregoing (collectively, with
Benefit Plan Investors, referred to as ‘‘Plans’’). Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code
prohibit Benefit Plan Investors from engaging in certain transactions with persons that are ‘‘parties in
interest’’ under ERISA or ‘‘disqualified persons’’ under the Code with respect to such Benefit Plan
Investor. A violation of these ‘‘prohibited transaction’’ rules may result in an excise tax or other penalties
and liabilities under ERISA and the Code for such persons or the fiduciaries of such Benefit Plan Investor.
In addition, Title I of ERISA requires fiduciaries of a Benefit Plan Investor subject to ERISA to make
investments that are prudent, diversified and in accordance with the governing plan documents. Employee
benefit plans that are governmental plans, certain church plans or other plans that are not subject to the
fiduciary and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code may be subject to
similar restrictions under applicable state, local or other law (‘‘Similar Law’’).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the
administration of such a Benefit Plan Investor or the management or disposition of the assets of such a
Benefit Plan Investor, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such a Benefit
Plan Investor, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the Benefit Plan Investor. ERISA requires
fiduciaries of a Benefit Plan Investor subject to ERISA to make investments that are prudent, diversified
and in accordance with the governing plan documents. In considering an investment in the Notes of a
portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should consult with its counsel in order to determine the
suitability of the Notes for such Plan, including whether the investment is in accordance with the
documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any
Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any
other applicable Similar Law.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by or on behalf of a Benefit Plan Investor could be considered
to give rise to a prohibited transaction if we are or become, or another party involved with this Offering is
or becomes, a party in interest or a disqualified person with respect to such Benefit Plan Investor. Certain
exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of the
Notes by a Benefit Plan Investor depending on the type and circumstances of the plan fiduciary making the
decision to acquire such Notes and the relationship of the party in interest to the Benefit Plan Investor.
Included among these exemptions are: Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code
for certain transactions between a Benefit Plan Investor and non-fiduciary service providers to the Benefit
Plan Investor; Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption (‘‘PTCE’’) 96-23, regarding transactions effected by
‘‘in-house asset managers;’’ PTCE 95-60, regarding investments by insurance company general accounts;
PTCE 91-38, regarding investments by bank collective investment funds; PTCE 90-1, regarding
investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; and PTCE 84-14, regarding transactions
effected by ‘‘qualified professional asset managers.’’ Even if the conditions specified in one or more of
these exemptions are met, the scope of the relief provided by these exemptions might or might not cover
all acts which might be construed as prohibited transactions. There can be no assurance that any of these,
or any other exemption, will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, and
prospective acquirers that are Benefit Plan Investors should consult with their legal advisors regarding the
applicability of any such exemption.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing ‘‘plan assets’’
of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding (i) are entitled to exemption relief from the prohibited
transaction provisions of ERISA and the Code and are otherwise permissible under all applicable Similar

320


-----

Law or (ii) would not otherwise constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or any violation of applicable Similar Law.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all inclusive, nor should it be
construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon
persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or
other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with
their counsel regarding the suitability of an acquisition of the Notes in light of such prospective purchaser’s
particular circumstances, potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Law
to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the
Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a representation by any of the Issuer, Guarantors or the
Initial Purchasers or any of their respective affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all
relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that such investment is
appropriate for any such Plan.

**Representation**

By acquiring a Note (or interest therein), each purchaser and transferee (and if the purchaser or transferee
is a Plan, its fiduciary) is deemed to represent, warrant and covenant that either (i) it is not acquiring the
Note (or interest therein) with the assets of a Plan; or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Note (or
interest therein) will not give rise to a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code or a violation of Similar Law.

321

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Additional Notes will be represented by two global notes in bearer form, without interest coupons
attached. One global note will represent Additional Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A, such global note initially being a temporary 144A global note which, after the expiration of
certain U.S. selling restrictions on June, 2020, will be replaced by a permanent 144A
global note (each such global note, an ‘‘Additional 144A Global Note’’), and one global note (the
‘‘Additional Regulation S Global Note’’ and together with the Additional 144A Global Note, the ‘‘Additional
**Global Notes’’) will represent Additional Notes sold in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons pursuant to**
Regulation S. The Additional Global Notes are in addition to the one global note (the ‘‘Original 144A
**Global Note’’) which represents the Existing Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to**
Rule 144A and one global note (the ‘‘Original Regulation S Global Note’’ and together with the Original
144A Global Note, the ‘‘Original Global Notes’’) which represents the Existing Notes sold in offshore
transactions to non-U.S. persons pursuant to Regulation S. The Additional 144A Global Note together
with the Original 144A Global Note, the ‘‘144A Global Note’’, the Additional Regulation S Global Note
together with the Original Regulation S Global Note, the ‘‘Regulation S Global Note’’, and the Original
Global Notes together with the Additional Global Notes, the ‘‘Global Notes’’.

Upon issuance, each of the Global Notes will be deposited with and immobilized, and held by Clearstream
Banking AG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, (‘‘Clearstream Banking’’) and will be kept in custody by
Clearstream Banking until all obligations of the Issuer under the Additional Notes have been satisfied.
Definitive notes representing individual Additional Notes and interest coupons will not be issued.

All interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of Clearstream Banking.
The Additional Notes will be transferable, subject to the limitations and procedures described below under
‘‘—Transfers’’, by appropriate entries in securities accounts in accordance with applicable rules of
Clearstream Banking. The Additional Notes will not be eligible for clearance through the facilities of the
Depositary Trust Company.

Pursuant to the Book-Entry Registration Agreement between the Issuer and Clearstream Banking, to be
dated on or around the issue date of the Additional Notes, the Issuer has appointed Clearstream Banking
as its book-entry registrar (the ‘‘Book-Entry Registrar’’) in respect of the Notes, and agreed on an agent
for the Issuer to maintain (i) a register reflecting the aggregate number of Notes, represented by each
Global Note in accordance with the Conditions of Issue and (ii) a register (the ‘‘Book-Entry Register’’)
containing records of the Notes credited to the accounts of the accountholders of Clearstream Banking, for
the benefit of the Holders of the co-ownership interests (Miteigentumsanteile) in the Notes represented by
the Global Notes.

The Issuer and Clearstream Banking have agreed, for the benefit of the Holders of co ownership interests
in the Notes, that the actual number of Notes, represented by each Global Note from time to time shall be
evidenced by the records of the Book-Entry Registrar. No transfer of any Note through the clearing system
shall be effective unless it is recorded in the Book-Entry Register. Ownership of interests in each Global
Note will be limited to persons who have accounts with Clearstream Banking (‘‘participants’’) or persons
who hold interests through participants (‘‘indirect participants’’).

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Clearstream Banking will be effected in accordance with the applicable
rules of Clearstream Banking rules and, outside of the Federal Republic of Germany, of Clearstream
Banking, (42 Avenue JF Kennedy, 1855 Luxembourg, Luxembourg) and Euroclear Bank SA/NV
(Boulevard du Roi Albert II, 1210 Brussels, Belgium) as operator of the Euroclear System and any
successor in such capacity, and will be settled in immediately available funds. The Notes will be
transferable only in minimum aggregate principal amounts of A100,000 and any integral multiple of A1,000
in excess thereof. Each Global Note and interests in each Global Note will be subject to restrictions on
transfer as described under ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ and ‘‘Plan of Distribution—Selling and Transfer
_Restrictions’’._

The Notes represented by a 144A Global Note may be exchanged for Notes represented by a Regulation S
Global Note and vice versa, except that no such exchange can be effected in the period starting three
business days prior to any payment of principal, interest or any other amount under the Conditions of Issue
until (and including) the date of such payment.

322


-----

If a holder who holds a book-entry interest in a 144A Global Note wishes at any time to exchange its
interest in a 144A Global Note for an interest in a Regulation S Global Note, or to transfer its interest in a
144A Global Note to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in a
Regulation S Global Note, it may, subject to the rules and procedures of the clearing system and the
requirements set forth in this paragraph, exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of such interest for an
equivalent interest in a Regulation S Global Note. Such exchange or transfer shall only be made upon:

(a) receipt by the Transfer Agent of a certificate, in the form obtainable from the Transfer Agent,
given by such holder (i) instructing the Transfer Agent to credit or cause to be credited an interest
in a Regulation S Global Note in an amount equal to the interest in a 144A Global Note of the
same series to be exchanged or transferred, (ii) containing information regarding the account to
be credited with such increase and instructing the Transfer Agent to make arrangements to
deliver such increase to such account, and (iii) stating that the exchange or transfer of such
interest has been made pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S
or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act; and

(b) transfer of its interest in a 144A Global Note to be transferred or exchanged to the account of the
Transfer Agent with the clearing system designated by the Transfer Agent.

If a Holder who holds a book-entry interest in a Regulation S Global Note wishes at any time to exchange
its interest in a Regulation S Global Note for an interest in a 144A Global Note, or to transfer its interest
in a Regulation S Global Note to a person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in
a 144A Global Note, it may, subject to the rules and procedures of the clearing system and the
requirements set forth in this paragraph, exchange or transfer or cause the transfer of such interest for an
equivalent interest in a 144A Global Note. Such exchange or transfer shall only be made upon:

(a) receipt by the Transfer Agent of a certificate, in the form obtainable from the Transfer Agent,
given by such holder (i) instructing the Transfer Agent to credit or cause to be credited an interest
in a 144A Global Note in an amount equal to the interest in a Regulation S Global Note to be
exchanged or transferred, and(ii) containing information regarding the account to be credited
with such increase and instructing the Transfer Agent to make arrangements to deliver such
increase to such account; and

(b) transfer of its interest in a Regulation S Global Note to be transferred or exchanged to the
account of the Transfer Agent with the Clearing System designated by the Transfer Agent.

Any exchange of Notes represented by a 144A Global Note for Notes, represented by a Regulation S
Global Note, or vice versa, shall be recorded on the register and shall be effected by an increase or a
reduction in the aggregate amount represented by a 144A Global Note by the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes, so exchanged and a corresponding reduction or increase in the aggregate principal amount of
Notes represented by the relevant Regulation S Global Note.

Pursuant to an agreement dated on or around the issue date of the Additional Notes between the Issuer
and Clearstream Banking, the Issuer has appointed Clearstream Banking as the Book-Entry Registrar for
the Notes. The Book-Entry Registrar has agreed to maintain the Book-Entry Register, as agent of the
Issuer, showing the interests of Clearstream Banking accountholders in the Global Notes. No transfer of
any Note through the clearing system shall be effective unless it is recorded in the Book-Entry Register. On
any redemption of, or payment of an installment on, or purchase and cancellation of, any of the Notes
represented by a Global Note the Issuer shall procure that details of any redemption, payment or purchase
and cancellation (as the case may be) in respect of that Global Note shall be entered accordingly in the
register and, upon any such entry being made, the principal amount of the Notes represented by the Global
Notes shall be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of the Notes so redeemed or purchased and
cancelled or by the aggregate amount of such installment so paid and appropriate entries shall be made in
the Book-Entry Register by the Book-Entry Registrar.

**Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes**

The following summaries of those operations and procedures are provided herein solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, Guarantors or the Initial
Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures.

323


-----

The Issuer and the Guarantors understand the following with respect to Clearstream Banking:

   - Clearstream Banking holds securities for participating organizations and facilitates the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry
changes in accounts of those participants;

  - Clearstream Banking provides to its participants, among other things, services for safekeeping,
administration, clearance and settlement of securities and securities lending and borrowing;

   - Clearstream Banking participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers
and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations; and

   - indirect access to Clearstream Banking is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Clearstream
Banking participant, either directly or indirectly.

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes will be made by the Issuer in
euros to the Paying Agent, which will pay such amounts to Clearstream Banking, as the holder of the
Global Notes. Clearstream Banking will, in turn, distribute those payments to its participants in accordance
with its procedures. Payments by participants and indirect participants of Clearstream Banking to the
owners of interests in a Global Note will be the responsibility of those participants or indirect participants.

Investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications relating to
the Notes through Clearstream Banking on days when the Clearstream Banking system is open for
business. That system may not be open for business on certain days when banks, brokers and other
institutions are open for business in the United States. In addition, because of time-zone differences, there
may be complications in connection with completing transactions through Clearstream Banking on the
same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer an interest in a Global Note
or to receive or make a payment or delivery of such an interest on a particular day may find that the
transaction will not be performed until the next business day in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

**ACTION BY OWNERS OF BOOK-ENTRY INTERESTS**

Clearstream Banking has advised the Issuer that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the book-entry interests in the
Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes
as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Clearstream Banking will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of
the Global Notes.

Book-entry interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification
requirements as discussed in ‘‘Plan of Distribution—Selling and Transfer Restrictions’’.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

_Because of the following restrictions, you are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale,_
_pledge or other transfer of the Additional Notes offered hereby._

The Additional Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except

Securities Act and other applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Additional Notes are being
offered and sold only (i) to ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ (as defined in Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act) (‘‘QIBs’’) in reliance on Rule 144A and (ii) to persons other than ‘‘U.S. persons’’ (as

(2) It is neither the Issuer’s ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 144), nor acting on its behalf and that
either;

(a) it is a QIB, within the meaning of Rule 144A and is aware that any sale of these Additional
Notes to it will be made in reliance on Rule 144A, and such acquisition will be for its own
account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) it is purchasing the Additional Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with
Regulation S;

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers, nor any person
representing any of them, has made any representation to it with respect to the Issuer and its
subsidiaries or the offer or sale of any of the Additional Notes, other than the information
contained in this offering memorandum, which offering memorandum has been delivered to it
and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Additional
Notes. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this
offering memorandum. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning the
Issuer and its subsidiaries and the Additional Notes that it deems necessary in connection with its
decision to purchase any of the Additional Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of,
and request information from, the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers;

(4) It is purchasing the Additional Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor accounts
for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or
for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the U.S. Securities Act
or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property
or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within its or their control and
subject to its or their ability to resell such Additional Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S
or any other exemption from registration available under the U.S. Securities Act, or in any
transaction not subject to the U.S. Securities Act;

(5) It agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is purchasing the
Additional Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Additional Notes by its acceptance thereof
will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Additional Notes prior to the

date (the ‘‘Resale Restriction Termination Date’’) that is, in the case of the Rule 144A Notes, one
year after the latest of the original issue date of the Additional Notes and the last date on which
the Issuer or any of its affiliates were the owner of such Additional Notes (or any predecessor
thereof), only (i) to the Issuer or the Guarantors; (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has
been declared effective under the U.S. Securities Act; (iii) for so long as the Additional Notes are
eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that
purchases for its own account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the
transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A; (iv) pursuant to offers and sales that occur
outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S; or
(v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act, subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the
disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times
within its or their control and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws, and any
applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuer and the Holders’
Representative’s rights prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (v) above to
require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certification and other information satisfactory to
each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer is
completed and delivered by the transferor to the Holders’ Representative. The foregoing
restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Additional Note will bear a legend substantially to the
following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN, AND WILL NOT BE, REGISTERED UNDER THE
U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘U.S. SECURITIES ACT’’), OR
THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS
SECURITY NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE REOFFERED,
SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE
DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH
TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.

IN THE CASE OF RULE 144 NOTES: THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY, BY ITS
ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT IS A ‘‘QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER’’ (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT (‘‘RULE 144A’’)) OR (B) IT IS NOT A U.S. PERSON AND IS
ACQUIRING THIS ADDITIONAL NOTE IN AN ‘‘OFFSHORE TRANSACTION’’
PURSUANT TO RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT,
AND (2) AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR FOR
WHICH IT HAS PURCHASED SECURITIES TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE RESALE RESTRICTION
TERMINATION DATE, WHICH IS ONE YEAR AFTER THE LATEST OF THE
ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF, AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR
ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY
PREDECESSOR OF THIS SECURITY), ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER OR THE
GUARANTORS, (B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS
BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO
LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A,
TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A
QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE
TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (D) PURSUANT TO

COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, OR
(E) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT IN EACH
OF THE FOREGOING CASES TO ANY REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE
DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY OF SUCH INVESTOR
ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL AND
IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, AND ANY

326


-----

APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE
ISSUER’S AND THE HOLDERS’ REPRESENTATIVE’S RIGHTS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH
OFFER, SALE OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSES (D) OR (E) TO REQUIRE THE
DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND OTHER
INFORMATION SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM.

If the Additional Notes are issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Additional Notes will bear the following legend:

ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT. THE ADDITIONAL NOTES HAVE BEEN ISSUED WITH
ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT (‘‘OID’’) FOR UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX
PURPOSES. IN SUCH CASE, THE ISSUE PRICE, THE AMOUNT OF OID, THE ISSUE
DATE AND THE YIELD TO MATURITY MAY BE OBTAINED BY CONTACTING THE
ISSUER AT PROGROUP AG, HEAD OF TREASURY, HORSTRING 12, 76829 LANDAU,
GERMANY

A purchaser of Additional Notes will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing
restrictions apply to Holders of beneficial interests in these T Notes as well as to Holders of these
Additional Notes.

(6) It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Additional Notes notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of such Additional Notes;

(7) It acknowledges that the Book-Entry Registrar and Transfer Agent will not be required to accept
for registration or transfer any Additional Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of
evidence satisfactory to the Issuer, Transfer Agent and the Book-Entry Registrar that the
restrictions set out therein have been complied with;

(8) It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon
the truth and accuracy of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed
to have been made by your purchase of the Additional Notes are no longer accurate, it shall
promptly notify the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Additional Notes as a
fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment
discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of each such investor
account; and

(9) It understands that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by
the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would result in a public offering of the
Additional Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or
any other material relating to the Issuer or the Additional Notes in any jurisdiction where action
for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Additional Notes will be subject to
the selling restrictions set out under ‘‘Plan of Distribution’’, ‘‘Notice to EEA Investors’’ and
‘‘Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors’’.

327


-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

**General**

The Issuer has agreed to sell to Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft,
Goldman Sachs International and HSBC Bank plc (the ‘‘Initial Purchasers’’), and the Initial Purchasers
have agreed, subject to certain customary closing conditions, to subscribe to and pay for, the Additional
Notes on the issue date of the Additional Notes.

The sale will be made pursuant to an agreement among the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Initial
Purchasers (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement,
the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, to purchase
from the Issuer all of the Additional Notes. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the
Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the
delivery of certain legal opinions by the Issuer’s and their counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides
that the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including
liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be
required to make in respect thereof. The Issuer has furthermore agreed to reimburse the Initial Purchasers
for certain expenses incurred in connection with the issue of the Additional Notes. In the Purchase
Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors have made certain representations and given certain warranties
in respect of their respective legal and financial matters. The Initial Purchasers is entitled, under certain
circumstances, to terminate the Purchase Agreement. In such event, no Additional Notes will be delivered
to investors.

**No Sale of Similar Securities**

The Issuer has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, that it or its affiliates and subsidiaries will not,
directly or indirectly, sell or offer to sell any of the Additional Notes or other euro-denominated debt
securities with a tenor of more than one year for a period of 120 days from the date the Additional Notes
are issued without first obtaining the written consent of the Sole Global Coordinator.

**New Issue of Additional Notes**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the ‘‘Authority’’) for the
listing of and permission to deal in the Additional Notes on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange (the ‘‘Exchange’’).There is no assurance that the Additional Notes will be listed on the Official
List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Additional Notes will be granted, or that such
listing will be maintained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may at its sole option at any time,
without the consent of the Holders or the Holders’ Representative, de-list the Additional Notes from any
stock exchange for the purposes of moving the listing of the Additional Notes to another recognized stock
exchange for high yield issuers (which may be a stock exchange that is not regulated by the European
Union). The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Additional Notes
after completion of the Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are under no obligation to do so and may
discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, any such market-making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly,
it cannot be assured that any market for the Additional Notes will develop, or that such market will be
liquid if it does develop, or that an investor will be able to sell any Additional Notes at a particular time or
at a price which will be favorable.

**Stamp Tax**

Persons that purchase the Additional Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty,
taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to
the offering price.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this Offering, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the ‘‘Stabilizing Manager’’) (or
persons acting on its behalf) may purchase and sell Additional Notes in the open market. These
transactions may include over allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and
penalty bids. Over allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for
the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Additional Notes in the open

328


-----

market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Additional Notes. Syndicate
covering transactions involve purchases of the Additional Notes in the open market after the distribution
has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim
a selling concession from a broker/dealer when the Additional Notes originally sold by such broker/dealer
are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions.

These transactions may be effected in the over the counter market or otherwise. These activities may
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Additional Notes. As a result, the price of
the Additional Notes may be higher than the prices that otherwise might exist in the open market. Neither
the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Additional
Notes. In addition, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager to engage in such transactions and
neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager will
engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without
notice. Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue
date of the Additional Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Additional Notes.

**Initial Settlement**

It is expected that delivery of the Additional Notes will be made against payment therefore on or around
the date specified on the cover page of the offering memorandum, which will be the tenth business day
following the date of pricing of the Additional Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T+10’’).
Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Additional Notes on the date of pricing or the next seven succeeding
business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to
prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Additional Notes who wish to trade the Additional Notes on
the date of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days should consult their own advisor.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates, from time to time, may provide in the future,
investment banking, commercial lending, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuer and its
affiliates for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees, commissions and expense
reimbursement. In particular, (i) the Issuer as company and original guarantor, Progroup Board sp. z o.o.
as borrower and original guarantor, the other existing Guarantors as original guarantors and
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as mandated lead arranger, original lender and agent, have entered into
the Existing Senior Secured PLN Facilities, (ii) the Issuer as company and original guarantor, Progroup
Board Ltd. as borrower and original guarantor, the other Guarantors as original guarantors, Goldman
Sachs Bank USA as original lender and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC as agent, have entered into
the Existing Senior Secured GBP Facility, (iii) the Issuer as company, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH as
borrower, the other Guarantors as original guarantors and Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft as lender and
agent, have entered into the Existing Senior Commerzbank Facilities, and (iv) the Issuer as company and
original guarantor, Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH as borrower, the other Guarantors as original guarantors
and HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt AG as lender and agent, have entered into the Existing Senior Secured
HSBC Facility. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or certain of their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers
and lenders under the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, and such entities may act as counterparties
under certain hedging arrangements into which the Group has entered and expects to enter into in the
future, and they will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities.

**Selling and Transfer Restrictions**

The Additional Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or qualified for sale under the securities laws of any U.S. state or any jurisdiction outside the
United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on
Rule 144A and to non U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Accordingly, the
Additional Notes will be subject to significant restrictions on resale and transfer as described under ‘‘Notice
_to Investors’’, ‘‘Notice to EEA Investors’’, ‘‘Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer_
_Restrictions’’. Any offer or sale of Additional Notes in the United States in reliance on Rule 144A will be_
made by broker dealers who are registered as such under the Exchange Act.

329


-----

The Additional Notes will constitute a new class of securities with no established trading market. The
Initial Purchasers have advised us that, following the completion of this Offering, they currently intend to
make a market in the Additional Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the
Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so, and the Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market
making activities with respect to the Additional Notes at any time in its sole discretion. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given that any market for the Additional Notes will develop, that it will be liquid and that
you will be able to sell any of the Additional Notes held by you at a particular time or that the prices that
you receive when you sell will be favorable to you. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes—An active
_trading market may not develop for the Additional Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Additional Notes_
_may be limited’’. Each purchaser of the Additional Notes, by its purchase of the Additional Notes, will be_
deemed to have made certain acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth
under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’, ‘‘Notice to EEA Investors’’ and ‘‘Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors’’.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it:

  - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the United Kingdom Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ‘‘FSMA’’) received
by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Additional Notes in circumstances in which
section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors); and

  - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Additional Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available
and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the
purposes of this provision, the expression ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is one (or more) of the
following (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
‘‘MiFID II’’); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or
(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended).

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Germany and the United
Kingdom, by the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Additional
Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material
relating to the Issuer or the Additional Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Additional Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this
offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Additional
Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with
any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does
not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are
advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution
of this offering memorandum and resale of the Additional Notes. See ‘‘Notice to the Investors’’, ‘‘Notice to
_EEA Investors’’, ‘‘Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors’’ and ‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’._

The Issuer and the Guarantors have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such
offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the
U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer
and sale of the Additional Notes.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany. Other Guarantors are
incorporated in Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. None of the directors, officers or
other executives of the Issuer and the Guarantors are residents or citizens of the United States. Therefore,
you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on the directors, officers or
executives. Furthermore, since the assets of the Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their
respective directors and officers are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the
United States against the Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with respect
to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Notes or any judgment of a U.S. court
predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. Federal or state securities laws, may not be collectible in the
United States.

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of
civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to
enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do
not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than
arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or
state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would
not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however,
may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung).
In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter
decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a
German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

   - the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law;

  - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

  - the defendant having had the chance to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely
served complaint;

  - the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a
recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court;

   - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the matter
(Verfahren) pending before a German court, provided that such German matter was pending
before a German court prior to the U.S. court entered its judgment;

  - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial
foundations of German law, in particular with the civil liberties (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue
of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

   - generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that
attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful.

In addition, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German
courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. Moreover, a German court may
reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they
are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With
respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other
jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the
proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the
deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any
proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process exists under German law.

We have been advised by French, Czech, Polish and English counsel that similar risks related to enforcing
judgments from a U.S. federal or state court exist in such jurisdictions, and we cannot assure you that such
risks do not and will not exist in other jurisdictions, including those in which the assets of some or all of our
subsidiaries that may guarantee the Notes in the future are located.

**SELECTED EXPLANATORY INFORMATION FROM THE NOTES FOR**
**THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1 TO MARCH 31, 2019**

**Accounting and valuation methods**

The quarterly consolidated financial statements as at March 31, 2019 and the audited consolidated
financial statements as at December 31, 2018 have been prepared in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the First and Second Sections of the Third Book of the German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch—HGB) and the supplementary provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act
(Aktiengesetz—AktG), and in addition, the quarterly consolidated financial statements have been prepared
in application, _mutatis mutandis, of GAS 16 (German Accounting Standard) and GAAS 7 (German_
Amendment Accounting Standard).

The accounting and valuation policies applied are unchanged from those applied in the consolidated
financial statements as at December 31, 2018. A detailed presentation of these methods is included in the
notes to the consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2018. Income taxes are calculated on the
basis of actual results and fixed tax rates. The calculation method corresponds to and is consistent with the
calculation method used for the annual financial statements. DRS 25 will be applied for the first time in
fiscal year 2019.

**Scope of Consolidation**

With effect from February 19, 2019, Progroup Board GmbH established Progroup Board Kft. with its
registered office in Hungary (Budapest) and a share capital of EUR 25,000.00, which is thus also included
in the scope of consolidation. The company was established for the purpose of acquiring real property, but
had not yet developed any further business activities as at March 31, 2019 and is therefore managed as an
inactive company.

**Key business transactions 2019**

**Investment in a new Progroup Board plant in the United Kingdom**

On April 18, 2017, Progroup AG published its plans for the construction of a new corrugated board

board production site was built at the Ellesmere Port site, UK by Progroup Board Ltd. with an investment
volume of approx. GBP 75 to 80 million. Construction began in the fourth quarter of 2017; production
commenced in January 2019.

**Investment in a new paper machine in Germany**

On February 16, 2018, Progroup AG published its plans for the construction of a new paper machine in
Germany. As part of the Two Twentyfive strategy concept, a new paper machine will be installed at the
Sandersdorf-Brehna site, Germany by 2020. Preparatory and planning work for the construction of the
plant began in the second quarter of 2018. Construction commenced in the first quarter of 2019.

Commissioning is planned for the second half of 2020.

**Investment in a new Progroup Board plant in Germany**

**SELECTED EXPLANATORY INFORMATION FROM THE NOTES FOR**
**THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1 TO MARCH 31, 2019 (Continued)**

**Explanation of the material changes in balance sheet and income statement items from January 1 to**
**March 31, 2019 compared with the figures presented for the previous year**

Recycled paper is the main raw material for the production of corrugated board base paper, which is then
the main raw material for corrugated board production in the subsequent value-added stage. Mainly due to
decreases in demand for recycled paper from regions outside Europe, prices for recycled paper declined
during the first half of 2018. Since then, prices for recycled paper have stabilised at a low level. In the first
quarter of 2019, prices were at the level of the fourth quarter of 2018 (�1%), but well below the level of
the prior year’s quarter.

Following price increases in the first quarter of 2018, prices for corrugated base paper stabilised in the
second and third quarters of 2018. Since the fourth quarter of 2018, prices have been falling (Q1 2019
compared to Q4 2018 �8%).

The price development for corrugated board typically follows the price development for corrugated base
paper with a slight time lag and also showed price increases throughout 2018. In line with the further paper
price development, the price level fell since the fourth quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, the
price level was 3% below the level of the fourth quarter of 2018.

**Sales increased by 0.6% (EUR 1.6 million) to EUR 245.4 million in the first three months of 2019 from**
EUR 243.8 million in the first three months of 2018. The increase in sales is exclusively attributable to
further strong growth of our corrugated board sales (+5% or EUR 11 million). Our external sales of
corrugated base paper continued to decline (by 64.7% or EUR 10 million) as internal demand continued
to grow with the growth of Progroup Board and the scarcity of corrugated base paper on the market.

**Other operating income increased by 112% (EUR 1.8 million) to EUR 3.3 million in the first three months**
of 2019, mainly as a result of income from the reversal of provisions, income from other periods and an
increase in income from exchange rate differences.

The cost of materials decreased slightly by 1.3% (EUR 1.5 million) to EUR 117.8 million compared to the
first three months of 2018. This reduction is attributable to lower costs of raw materials, consumables and
supplies.

**Personnel expenses increased by 16.3% (EUR 3.0 million) to EUR 21.4 million in the first three months of**
2019 compared to the same period in 2018. This increase is mainly attributable to a higher average number
of employees due to the expansion of the workforce in the growth projects in Eisfeld, Germany and
Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. Besides, additional positions were created in the administrative and group
corporate divisions reflecting the strong growth.

**Other operating expenses increased slightly by 0.3% (EUR 0.1 million) to EUR 42.5 million in the first three**
months of 2019, primarily due to a EUR 1.7 million increase in outbound freight in the first three months
of 2019 compared to the prior-year period and an increase of expenses for maintenance by
EUR 3.3 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in expenses for maintenance is mainly
attributable to the planned downtimes due to scheduled maintenance of both paper machines in March
2019. Freight expenses increased mainly due to higher freight volumes and higher freight rates. Compared
to previous year contrary effects were generated by the absence of extraordinary expenses of EUR

Compared to the first three months of 2018, EBITDA[1] decreased by 3.6% (EUR 2.5 million) to EUR 67.2
million. This is mainly due to the scheduled downtimes of both paper machines in March 2019 and the
higher average number of employees and industrial workers. In the first quarter, the good operating
performance with volume growth at Progroup Board had an offsetting effect on EBITDA.

The negative interest result deteriorated by 1.4% (EUR 0.01 million) to EUR �6.1 million compared with
the first three months of the prior year.

In the first three months of 2019, **consolidated net income for the period increased by EUR 1.1 million**
year-on-year to EUR 33.4 million.

As a result of the slightly stronger result in the first three months of 2019, **taxes on income increased**
accordingly by EUR 1.6 million to EUR 13.9 million.

**Fixed assets amounted to EUR 807.6 million as at March 31, 2019, compared with EUR 742.2 million as at**
December 31, 2018. The increase (8.8%) is mainly attributable to the construction of the new PM3 paper
machine and the PW12 and PW13 Progroup Board plants.

**Inventories amounted to EUR 108.0 million as at March 31, 2019 which is below the level as at**
December 31, 2018 (�2.3% or EUR �2.5 million), mainly attributable to work in process. This decline is
mainly due to a lower stock of corrugated base.

**Trade receivables increased to EUR 128.2 million (+ 17.9% or EUR 19.5 million) as at March 31, 2019,**
mainly due to year-end effects and lower sales in December.

**Other assets increased by EUR 5.2 million or 28.7% to EUR 23.4 million as at March 31, 2019, mainly in**
connection with an increase in other receivables from sales tax prepayments.

**Cash in hand and bank balances amounted to EUR 136.0 million as at March 31, 2019, down 8.4%**
(EUR 12.4 million) compared to December 31, 2018.

**Prepaid expenses and deferred charges increased by EUR 1.3 million to EUR 20.6 million as at March 31,**
2019.

**Shareholder’s Equity increased on the basis of the consolidated result by 10.8% from EUR 315.5 million as**
at December 31, 2018 to EUR 349.5 million as at March 31, 2019.

1 EBITDA (not a German GAAP measure) is calculated as sales, plus increase/decrease in finished goods and work in process,
plus other operating income (excluding any extraordinary income), plus other own work capitalised, minus costs of materials,
minus personnel expenses, minus other operating expenses, minus other taxes, plus extraordinary expenses. The extraordinary
expenses reported under other expenses (§ 285 no. 31 HGB) correspond to the extraordinary expenses in the reporting period
in accordance with the definition of EBITDA.

**SELECTED EXPLANATORY INFORMATION FROM THE NOTES FOR**
**THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1 TO MARCH 31, 2019 (Continued)**

**Tax provisions increased by EUR 0.4 million or 1.1% to EUR 34.3 million as at March 31, 2019 due to the**
higher tax burden attributable to the slightly higher result.

**Other provisions as at March 31, 2019 increased by EUR 2.7 million or 4.7% to EUR 60.2 million as at the**
reporting date, mainly due to an increase in personnel provisions and provisions for outstanding invoices
for expenses.

As at March 31, 2019, bank loans increased by EUR 28.0 million to EUR 102.0 million due to a drawdown
of a loan of EUR 30 million to finance the construction of the PM3 paper machine. Contrary effects came
from scheduled repayments of EUR 2.2 million on the Senior Secured PLN Facilities.

The increase in trade payables by EUR 4.6 million or 9.3% to EUR 54.4 million as at March 31, 2019 is
mainly due to the current construction projects for new plants.

The increase in other liabilities by EUR 6.0 million to EUR 18.6 million as at March 31, 2019 is mainly
attributable to higher accrued interest for the bonds as well as higher liabilities from sales tax payments.

**Deferred tax liabilities increased by EUR 0.8 million as at March 31, 2019.**

This resulted mainly from the acquisition of the Progroup Power 1 GmbH combined heat and power plant.
Netted against deferred tax assets from the use of loss carryforwards and the elimination of intercompany
profits, deferred tax liabilities amount to EUR 0.8 million.

**Information on material risks**

There have been no significant changes with regard to the risks for Progroup AG in the period from
January 1 through March 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Report on subsequent events**

On May 2, 2019, the Annual General Meeting resolved to pay a dividend in the form of a gross dividend of
EUR 2.65 (gross) per share entitled to dividends from the net retained profits of EUR 210,329,798.99
reported in the annual financial statements for the 2018 financial year. Thus, the total amount of the
distribution, which was also made on May 2, 2019, amounted to EUR 20,108,825.40.

On March 27, 2018, Progroup AG successfully issued Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes in an amount of
EUR 450 million at an interest rate of 3.0%. Progroup used the proceeds from the Senior Secured Fixed
Rate Notes, amongst other things, to redeem in full the EUR 345 million interest-bearing bond (Senior
Secured Fixed Rate Notes) due 2022 on May 2, 2018 and to pay a special cash dividend of
EUR 86.5 million to the shareholders.

The note is secured, amongst other things, by pledging all shares in Progroup AG and the company shares
in its main subsidiaries, by pledging the bank deposits of the holding company Progroup AG, by assigning
tangible fixed assets of the subsidiaries and by granting real estate liens. Furthermore, certain covenants
apply with regard to the loans.

**II.** **Investments in a new corrugated board plant in Italy**

With effect of April 2, 2017, Progroup entered into a long-term framework and cooperation agreement for

established a new corrugated board production site PW 11 in close proximity to our cooperation partner in
Drizzona (Italy) with an investment volume of approximately EUR 15 million. Commencement of
production operations occurred in April 2018.

**III. Investments in a new corrugated board plant in the United Kingdom**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

Operations are planned to commence during the second half of 2020.

**V.** **Investments in a new corrugated board plant in Germany**

On September 10, 2018, Progroup AG announced its plan to establish a new corrugated board production

the fourth quarter of 2018. Production operations are expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the
first quarter of 2020.

**VI. Dividend distribution to Progroup AG shareholders**

The Annual General Meeting held on April 26, 2018 resolved the payment of a gross dividend of
EUR 11.40 per share entitled to dividends from the net retained profits reported in the annual financial
statements for the 2017 financial year in an amount of EUR 168,315,788.56. Thus, the total amount of the
distribution made on April 26, 2018 amounted to KEUR 86,506.

**VII. Renaming**

In the fourth quarter of 2018, all companies were renamed, except for Progroup AG and Prowell
Verwaltungs GmbH. A detailed overview can be found in Section F. III. of the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

**C.** **BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION**

The subsidiaries which have been included in the consolidated financial statements and the unconsolidated
subsidiaries are presented in section F. III. 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

As at April 10, 2018, Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Progroup AG, established
Progroup Paper PM3 GmbH with its registered office in Burg and a share capital of EUR 25,000.00 and
included this company in the scope of consolidation. The company was founded for the purpose of
constructing a new paper machine.

As at October 22, 2018, Progroup AG included Progroup Power 2 GmbH—with its registered office in
Burg and a share capital of EUR 25,000.00—in the scope of consolidation. The company was established
for the purpose of constructing a new combined heat and power plant. However, as at December 31, 2018,
the company had not conducted any business activity and, to that extent, is held as a dormant company.

Based on a merger agreement dated July 24, 2018 and certified by a notary public, Proservice GmbH and
PROfund GmbH were merged retrospectively as at January 1, 2018 with Progroup AG (merger by
absorption). The share in Proservice GmbH amounts to KEUR 0 as at December 31, 2018 (previous year:
KEUR 25).

In addition, by way of a merger agreement certified by notary public and also dated July 24, 2018,
Projekt 3 CZ Beteiligungs GmbH was merged with Progroup Board GmbH with retrospective effect as at
January 1, 2018.

**D.** **PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION**

Acquisitions made until December 31, 2009 continue to be accounted for in accordance with section 66(3)
of the Einf¨uhrungsgesetz zum Handelsgesetzbuch (EGHGB—Introductory Act to the German
Commercial Code), using the carrying amount method under section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB (former
version) by eliminating the cost of the equity investments against the proportionate amount that these
shares represent in the equity of the subsidiaries.

Acquisitions made after December 31, 2009 are accounted for in accordance with section 301(1) no. 1 of
the HGB (as amended) using the purchase method. With this method, the acquisition cost of the
investments is eliminated against the equity reflecting the fair value of the assets, liabilities, prepaid

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

expenses and deferred income as well as special items to be included in the consolidated financial
statements at the acquisition date.

The two companies which previously were not consolidated in accordance with section 296 (2) of the HGB
were combined as part of an intragroup merger during the year under review.

Receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies have been eliminated, with receivables and
liabilities amounting to KEUR 909,995 having been eliminated outside profit or loss.

In financial year 2018, intercompany profits from Progroup Paper PM1 GmbH’s and Progroup Paper
PM2 GmbH’s paper deliveries to affiliated companies increased by KEUR 2,182; they were eliminated
through profit or loss. Intragroup sales, intragroup other operating income and interest income have been
eliminated against corresponding expenses, with expenses and income amounting to KEUR 485,898 having
been eliminated.

Deferred taxes are generally recognised for consolidation adjustments recognised outside profit or loss as
well as for consolidation adjustments recognised through profit or loss. In 2018, consolidation adjustments
recognised through profit or loss related exclusively to the elimination of intercompany profits. Deferred
tax assets of KEUR 1,801 (previous year: KEUR 1,150) were recognised on eliminated intercompany
profits of KEUR 6,038 (previous year: KEUR 3,855).

**E.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**I.** **Disclosure of accounting policies applied**

**Intangible assets are measured at cost less amortisation. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis**
over the standard useful lives. The intangible assets are amortised over a useful life of 3 to 10 years. To the
extent that the fair values of individual intangible fixed assets fall below their carrying amounts, additional
impairment losses are recorded in case of an expected permanent impairment.

**Tangible fixed assets are measured at purchase and production cost less depreciation. Depreciation on**
additions to tangible fixed assets is generally recorded pro rata temporis. To the extent that the fair values
of individual assets fall below their carrying amounts, additional impairment losses are recorded in case of
an expected permanent impairment.

The purchase costs comprise expenses incurred to acquire an asset and to bring it to its working condition
to the extent that such costs can be allocated individually to such asset. Production cost comprises, if
applicable, direct material costs, direct labor costs and special costs of production, appropriate indirect
material costs and indirect labor costs, general and administrative costs and expenses for social amenities,
for voluntary social benefits and for occupational pensions. Borrowing costs have also been included in
production cost to the extent that they were attributable to the period of production.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the standard useful lives. Tangible fixed assets and
buildings are depreciated over the period of 3 to 33 years.

Prepayments made are presented in the balance sheet at their nominal amount.

**Investment grants are reported separately at their nominal amount on the liabilities side under the special**
item ‘‘investment grants for assets’’ and are reversed in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets
for which the grants were awarded.

Low-value assets costing up to EUR 250.00 each are fully written off in the year of acquisition. Assets
which are capable of being used independently and which cost between EUR 250.00 and EUR 1,000.00 are
posted to a collective item in the year of acquisition; this collective item is reversed as a charge to profit or
loss over 5 years.

**Financial assets are measured at cost or, in the event of an expected permanent impairment, at their lower**
fair value as at the balance sheet date.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**Inventories are measured at cost, taking account of the lower of cost or market value. Appropriate**
valuation allowances are recorded for any identifiable risks resulting from above-average storage periods,
reduced recoverability and/or lower replacement costs. In all cases, fair value measurement was
applied, i. e. write-downs are recognised to the extent that the expected selling prices less costs incurred
prior to disposal result in a lower fair value.

**Raw materials, consumables and supplies are measured at actual cost or, taking account of the principle of**
lower of cost or market value, at lower market values as at the reporting date. Replacement parts for
machines are also recognised under raw materials, consumables and supplies. Appropriate valuation
allowances are applied to inventories which are obsolete, second-hand, damaged or slow-moving
Lump-sum valuation allowances amounting to KEUR 8,681 (previous year: KEUR 1,834) were applied to
replacement parts which are obsolete, second-hand or slow-moving.

**Work in process and finished goods are measured at production cost. Production cost comprises, if**
applicable, direct material costs, direct labor costs and special costs of production, appropriate and
necessary indirect material costs, indirect labor costs, depreciation and amortisation of fixed assets that is
attributable to the production process and general and administrative costs and costs of occupational
pensions. Borrowing costs are not included in production cost.

**Receivables and other assets as well as the remaining assets are recognised at their principal amount or at**
their lower fair value as at the balance sheet date.

Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to receivables whose recoverability is associated with
identifiable risks; irrecoverable receivables are written off in full.

To cover the general risk from trade receivables, a global valuation allowance of 1% is recognised on
domestic and foreign receivables (net of value added tax) which are not subject to a specific valuation
allowance.

**Cash-in-hand and bank balances are measured at their nominal amounts.**

Payments before the balance sheet date are recognised as **prepaid expenses to the extent that they**
represent an expense for a specific period of time after this date.

**Deferred taxes are recognised at their calculated amount. For further explanations, please refer to Chapter F**
of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

**Subscribed capital is recognised at calculated amount.**

**Provisions are recognised at the settlement amount dictated by prudent business judgement. Provisions are**
recognised for liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount as well as for losses from onerous contracts. All
risks arising up to the balance sheet date and identifiable up to the date of the preparation of the financial
statements have been taken into account. Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year have to
be discounted using the average market interest rate of the last seven years applicable for their remaining
term, while pension provisions are discounted using the average market interest rate of the past ten years.

**Liabilities are carried at their settlement amount.**

Payments received before the reporting date are recognised as **deferred income to the extent that they**
represent income for a specific time period after this date.

**II.** **Currency translation disclosures**

Receivables, other assets, cash and cash equivalents and provisions and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated during the year into euros. Measurement as at the balance sheet date is at the
average spot exchange rate on December 31, 2018, with the principle of lower of cost or market value, or
higher settlement amount, as appropriate, being taken into account for receivables and liabilities with a
maturity of over one year in accordance with section 256a of the HGB.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from currency translation are recognised in other operating
income or expenses.

Translation of foreign subsidiary annual financial statements is carried out using the modified closing rate
method in accordance with section 308a HGB.

Currency translation differences from the consolidation of intercompany balances are recognised directly
in currency translation adjustments in equity.

A currency forward was concluded to hedge the currency risk of a loan granted by Progroup AG to the
subsidiary Progroup Board Ltd. in the amount of GBP 41.2 million. The hedged item and the hedges have
exactly the same maturity. A hedging relationship was established within the meaning of section 254 of the
HGB. The effective portions of the established hedging relationships are accounted for in the financial
statements using the so-called gross hedge presentation method (Durchbuchungsmethode). The currency
forward contract has a positive market value of KEUR 114 as at December 31, 2018, which was recorded
in currency translation adjustments in equity. The fair value was derived from the closing rate and the
risk-free interest rate based on the cost-of-carry method.

**F.** **DISCLOSURES AND EXPLANATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS IN THE**
**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT**

The financial year of all companies included in the consolidated financial statements corresponds to the
calendar year.

**I.** **Consolidated balance sheet**

**1.** **Fixed assets**

In connection with the acquisition of Progroup Power 1 GmbH in 2015 and related revaluation of acquired
fixed assets in correspondence with the capital consolidation, an operating license at acquisition cost of
KEUR 23,894 has been acquired. Subsequently, the operating license is amortised since 2015 over a
remaining useful life of 10 years. As at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is KEUR 16,850 with a
remaining term of 7 years.

The classification and movement in the financial year of the fixed asset accounts recognised in the
consolidated financial statements are separately presented as an appendix to the notes to the financial
statements in the fixed asset movement schedule.

Fixed asset production cost includes capitalised borrowing costs of KEUR 1,852 which were attributable to
the period of production. The capitalised borrowing costs were recognised in fixed assets in the line item
‘‘Construction in process’’. Interest capitalised in previous years was capitalised in tangible fixed assets,
primarily in buildings and technical equipment and machinery.

The value of construction in process as at December 31, 2018 is KEUR 141,056 (previous year:
EUR 32.7 million), mainly resulting from the Progroup Board plants in Ellesmere Port, UK, and Eisfeld,
Germany, as well as the Progroup Paper plant PM3 in Sandersdorf-Brehna, Germany. This includes own
work capitalised in the amount of EUR 5.7 million.

**2.** **Receivables and other assets**

As in the previous year, receivables and other assets do not include receivables due in more than one year.

As in the previous year, receivables from affiliated companies resulted exclusively from Group trading with
affiliated companies not fully consolidated.

Furthermore, other assets include input tax refund claims in an amount of KEUR 821 (previous year:
KEUR 280), which in accordance with tax law provisions come into existence only after the balance sheet
date.

To determine deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts for assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges and deferred income, and their tax
bases, or based on tax loss carryforwards and interest carried forward, the amounts of the resulting tax
liability and benefit were measured at the individual companies’ tax rates (17% - 30%) at the point in time
when the differences are reversed; they were not discounted. Deferred tax assets relating to loss
carryforwards were taken into account if it was probable that the loss would be offset within the next five
years. Today’s assessment may change in accordance with the companies’ income positions and tax
legislation in future years and may require to be adjusted. In addition, deferred tax assets were recognised
in financial year 2018 on consolidation adjustments for the elimination of intercompany profits in
accordance with § 306 HGB as well as from initial consolidation of Progroup Power 1 GmbH acquired in
2015.

Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards KEUR 1,106 (previous year: KEUR 650) and eligible interest
carried forward (German earnings stripping rule; KEUR 0 (previous year: KEUR 3,479)) were fully
recognised because the underlying tax planning confirms that the amounts recognised could actually be
utilised to reduce tax liabilities in the next 5 years. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
reported net.

**4.** **Subscribed capital**

The share capital of the parent company is EUR 7,588,236.00 and is divided into 7,588,236 no-par value
shares with a calculated amount of subscribed capital of one euro each.

Distribution potential is based on the annual financial statements of Progroup AG. The articles of
association do not contain any restrictions on distributions. There is a statutory restriction on distributions
equivalent to the deferred tax assets in the annual financial statements of Progroup AG pursuant to
section 268(8) of the HGB in the amount of EUR 0.9 million as well as from the measurement of the
pension liabilities pursuant to section 253(6) of the HGB in the amount of EUR 0.2 million.

**5.** **Investment grants for fixed assets**

Investment grants as well as redemption subsidies for fixed assets are reported as a special reserve and are
reversed on a pro rata basis in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for which the grants were
awarded.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**6.** **Pension provisions**

As at December 31, 2018, the balance amounts to KEUR 280 (previous year: KEUR 173).

This amount mainly includes pension provisions which were measured in accordance with the PUC
method using Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck’s 2018 G mortality tables.

The first-time application of the new 2018 G mortality tables results in a difference in the required amount
of pension provisions of KEUR 12.3. The provisions were discounted at the market interest rate of the
preceding ten years published by Deutsche Bundesbank (10-year average interest rate) assuming that all
liabilities have a remaining maturity of 15 years (section 253(2) sent. 2 of the HGB).

Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions:

  - Pension increase: +0% (previous year: 2%)

  - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2017)

   - Interest rate (10-year average): 3.21%

   - Interest rate (7-year average): 2.32%

Pension obligations for which provisions were required to be recognised amounted to KEUR 1,386 as at
the balance sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve
exclusively to settle liabilities from post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment
by third parties (so-called plan assets). A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan
asset. Plan assets that serve a specific purpose, have been pledged and are protected against insolvency
were measured based on information from the insurer as at December 31, 2018, at the asset value
(KEUR 1,209; this corresponds to the fair value). The balance remaining after the offset with the carrying
amount of the pension provision (KEUR 176) is reported under ‘‘provisions for pensions’’.

Effect on profit in 2018:

  - Interest expense from pension provision: KEUR 44

  - Interest income from plan assets: KEUR 25

The balance of interest expenses from the measurement of the pension provision (including the effect from
changes in interest) and interest income from the measurement of the plan assets was reported net in the
financial result. For the financial year, the balance between the measurement of the pension provision with
the 7-year average interest rate and the 10-year average interest rate amounts to KEUR 180 and is subject
to a distribution restriction at the level of the individual financial statements of Progroup AG.

amount of GBP 3 million. The loan taken out by Progroup AG in 2017 in the amount of EUR 37.2 million
(original loan principal: EUR 38.5 million, reduced by a redemption subsidy) at IKB Bank AG was fully

difference between the settlement value and the payment amount of the bond issued in 2015, which was
planned to be released as adjustment to interest expenses through profit or loss over the term of the bond

**PROGROUP AG,**

**Offenbach a. d. Queich,**

**Commercial Register Landau, HRB No. 2268**

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes issued in 2015 in the amount of KEUR 8,842. The liability remuneration
results from the pledging of shares to secure the bond issue in the amount of EUR 450 million as well as
from further measures in the context of the company’s refinancing.

**9.** **Taxes on income**

This account mainly includes trade tax and corporate income tax for the current financial year in the
amount of KEUR 51,060 (previous year: KEUR 23,775) and refunds payments of trade tax and corporate
income tax for previous years in the amount of KEUR 2,999 (previous year: KEUR 8). It also includes
expenses arising from the adjustment of deferred tax assets in the amount of KEUR 807 (previous year:
KEUR 4,228). In the financial year 2018, the total amount of tax paid was KEUR 34,202.

**III. Other disclosures**

**1.** **Contingent liabilities, off-balance sheet transactions and other financial commitments**

In addition to the bonds (amount as at December 31, 2018: EUR 600 million), there still is a revolving
credit facility in the amount of EUR 50 million which was granted by a syndicate of banks (Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility). As at December 31, 2018, the revolving credit facility was not utilised by the
company or any of its subsidiaries.

The bonds outstanding on the balance sheet date and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facilty, which can
also be utilised by subsidiaries of Progroup AG, as well as the two loans in a total amount of PLN 144.2
million granted to Progroup Board sp. z o. o. by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, the loan in an amount
of GBP 3 million to Progroup Board Ltd. by Goldman Sachs Bank USA as at December 31, 2018, and the
loans in a total amount of EUR 37.2 million granted to Progroup AG by IKB Bank AG are secured by
pledging all shares in Progroup AG and the company shares in its main subsidiaries, by pledging the bank
deposits of the parent company, by assigning tangible fixed assets of the subsidiaries and by granting real
estate liens. Furthermore, certain covenants apply with regard to the loans and/or bonds.

The bonds, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, two of the loans granted to Progroup Board
sp. z o. o. by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in the amount of PLN 144.2 million, the loan granted to
Progroup Board Ltd. by Goldman Sachs Bank USA in the amount of GBP 3 million as well as the loan
granted to Progroup AG by IKB Bank AG in the amount of EUR 37.2 million are secured pari passu as
mentioned above. However, in an Intercreditor Agreement the creditors were granted a priority
satisfaction from any proceeds from realisation.

Furthermore, the parent company has provided letters of comfort and guarantees for a total amount of
KEUR 41,784 to various suppliers of subsidiaries. The parent company also has assumed joint and several
co-liability vis-`a-vis CommerzFactoring GmbH for obligations of Progroup Board GmbH from a forfaiting
framework agreement.

The risk of enforcement should be regarded as low as none of the affiliates have a strained liquidity
position.

The companies lease forklifts and trucks under operating lease agreements so that these assets are not
recognised in the companies’ financial statements. As at December 2018, the remaining obligations from
the lease agreements were KEUR 8,239. In addition, there were rental and lease agreements for movable
assets as well as for the rental of factory buildings and areas as at the balance sheet date. As at
December 31, 2018, the remaining obligations from these rental/lease agreements for subsequent years
were KEUR 16,129 (nominal amount). The advantage of these agreements is that a lower amount of
capital is tied up in the beginning than with a purchase and there is an absence of realisation risk. Risks
could arise from the lease agreement periods if the assets can no longer be fully utilised, although there are
currently no indications of this.

As at the balance sheet date, there were steam supply contracts in place for the reliable supply of energy at
fixed prices which did not lead, however, to a recognition of a provision for contingent losses. These
agreements have terms of up to 7 years (December 31, 2025).

The following auditor’s report (Best¨atigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with section 322 of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and group
management report (Konzernlagebericht) of Progroup AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2018. The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

**To Progroup AG, Offenbach a.d. Queich, Germany**

**Audit Opinions**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, Offenbach a.d. Queich, Germany,
and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018,
and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash
flow statement for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2018, and notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented therein. In addition,
we have audited the group management report of Progroup AG for the financial year from January 1 to
December 31, 2018.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

  - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and
financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2018 and of its financial performance for the
financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2018 in compliance with German Legally Required
Accounting Principles, and

  - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the
Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately
presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 paragraph 3 sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB),
we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

**Basis for the Audit Opinions**

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in
the ‘‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report’’ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in
accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on
the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

**Other Information**

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

  - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

   - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

**Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements and the Group Management Report**

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the
consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
financial performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles.
In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group**
**Management Report**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and
of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

F-41


-----

     - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may
cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

    - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial
statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial
performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting
Principles.

     - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit
opinions.

     - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial
statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

     - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors
in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we
evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for
the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information
from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective
information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that
future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

consolidated income statement, notes to the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated cash flow
statement and the consolidated statement of changes in equity, have been prepared in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Parts One and Two of the Third Book of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB—German
Commercial Code) and the supplementary provisions of the Aktiengesetz (AktG—German Stock
Corporation Act). The previous year’s figures are stated for comparative purposes.

In the interest of greater clarity and transparency, below-the-line items to be reported for consolidated
balance sheet or consolidated income statement line items pursuant to the statutory provisions, as well as
disclosures and below-the-line items which may be reported either in the consolidated balance sheet and
consolidated income statement or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have all been

Insofar, as individual consolidated balance sheet items and/or consolidated income statement items have
been combined as part of the statutory regulations so as to provide better transparency. The composition

**B.** **SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS**

**I.** **New issue of floating rate notes amounting to EUR 150 million**

On March 27, 2017, Progroup AG successfully issued Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes in an amount of
EUR 150 million at an interest rate of three-month EURIBOR plus 2.5% p.a. with a term of seven years,
maturing on March 31, 2024. Progroup used the proceeds from these Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes,
among other things, to redeem the existing Floating Rate Note, which was issued in 2015 and had a
principal amount of EUR 75 million as at the date of the new issue (March 27, 2017), as well as to pay
certain transaction-related fees and expenses. The notes are secured by pledging all shares in Progroup AG
and the company shares in its main subsidiaries, by pledging the bank deposits of the holding company
Progroup AG, by assigning tangible fixed assets of the subsidiaries, by granting real estate liens and by
assignments of certain receivables. Furthermore, certain covenants apply with regard to the loans.

**II.** **Investments in the construction of a new Prowell plant**

With effect of December 1, 2015, Progroup entered into a long-term framework and cooperation
agreement for the construction of a further corrugated board plant in the southwest of Poland with one of
our key customers. Completion of the production building and commencement of production operations at
this location occurred in the first quarter of 2017. For the financing of the new plant, Prowell sp. z o.o.
entered into a loan agreement for a fixed rate loan in an amount of PLN 107 million with Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt, on May 31, 2016. Of these loans, an amount of PLN 15 million was already
repaid, resulting in a loan balance of PLN 92 million as at December 31, 2017.

**III. New subsidiary established in Italy—Investments in a new Prowell plant in Italy**

With effect of April 2, 2017, Progroup entered into a long-term framework and cooperation agreement for
the construction of a further corrugated board plant in Northern Italy with the Italian packaging specialist
Imbal Carton S.r.l./Italy. During the year 2017, our newly founded subsidiary Prowell S.r.l (Italy)
established a new corrugated board production site in close proximity to our cooperation partner in
Drizzona (Italy) with an investment volume of approximately EUR 13 million. Production operations at
this location are expected to start in the first quarter of 2018.

**IV.** **Investments in a new Prowell plant in the United Kingdom**

dividend of EUR 7.25 per share entitled to dividends from the net retained profits reported in the annual
financial statements for the 2016 financial year in an amount of EUR 158,410,638.55. Thus, the total
amount of the distribution made on April 20, 2017 amounted to EUR 55,014,711.00. Moreover, the
Extraordinary General Meeting on November 7, 2017 resolved the payment of an additional gross dividend
of EUR 0.33 per share entitled to dividends. Thus, the total amount of the distribution made on
November 7, 2017 amounted to EUR 2,504,117.88.

**C.** **BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION**

The subsidiaries which have been included in the consolidated financial statements and the unconsolidated
subsidiaries are presented in section F. III. 3 and 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
With effect of March 28, 2017, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary Prowell S.r.l., which was founded
at that date, were consolidated for the first time. Accordingly, the contributions to earnings attributable to
this company are contained in the consolidated income statement for the period from January 1 to
December 31, 2017 for the first time

**D.** **CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES**

Acquisitions made until December 31, 2009 continue to be accounted for in accordance with section 66(3)
of the Einf¨uhrungsgesetz zum Handelsgesetzbuch (EGHGB—Introductory Act to the German
Commercial Code), using the carrying amount method under section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB (former
version) by eliminating the cost of the equity investments against the proportionate amount that these
shares represent in the equity of the subsidiaries.

Acquisitions made after December 31, 2009 are accounted for in accordance with section 301(1) no. 1 of
the HGB (as amended) using the purchase method. With this method, the acquisition cost of the
investments is eliminated against the equity reflecting the fair value of the assets, liabilities, prepaid
expenses and deferred income as well as special items to be included in the consolidated financial
statements at the acquisition date.

Two affiliated companies have not been consolidated as permitted under section 296(2) of the HGB. These
companies are not material to the presentation of a true and fair view of the group’s net assets, financial
position and results of operation as sales and total assets of these companies amount to less than 1% of
consolidated sales and consolidated total assets. Consolidation as an associate has also been dispensed with
on the grounds of immateriality as permitted under section 311(2) of the HGB. Shares in these companies
are recognized at amortized cost. The companies are listed by name in section F. III. 4. of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

Receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies have been eliminated, with receivables and
liabilities amounting to KEUR 590,056 having been eliminated outside profit or loss.

In financial year 2016, intercompany profits from Propapier PM1 GmbH’s and Propapier PM2 GmbH’s
paper deliveries to affiliated companies increased to KEUR 2,642; they were eliminated through profit or
loss. Intragroup sales, intragroup other operating income and interest income have been eliminated against
corresponding expenses, with expenses and income amounting to KEUR 423,868 having been eliminated.

Deferred taxes are generally recognized for initial consolidation adjustments recognized outside profit or
loss as well as for consolidation adjustments recognized through profit or loss. In 2017, consolidation
adjustments recognized through profit or loss related exclusively to the elimination of intercompany

profits. Deferred tax assets of KEUR 1,150 (2016: KEUR 362) were recognized on eliminated
intercompany profits of KEUR 3,855 (2016: KEUR 1,213).

**E.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**I.** **Disclosure of accounting policies applied**

**Intangible assets are measured at cost less amortization. Amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis**
over the standard useful lives. The intangible assets are amortized over a useful life of 3 to 10 years. To the
extent that the fair values of individual intangible fixed assets fall below their carrying amounts, additional
impairment losses are recorded in case of an expected permanent impairment.

**Tangible fixed assets are measured at purchase and production cost less depreciation. Depreciation on**
additions to tangible fixed assets is generally recorded pro rata temporis. To the extent that the fair values
of individual assets fall below their carrying amounts, additional impairment losses are recorded in case of
an expected permanent impairment.

The purchase costs comprise expenses incurred to acquire an asset and to bring it to its working condition
to the extent that such costs can be allocated individually to such asset. Production cost comprises, if
applicable, direct material costs, direct labor costs and special costs of production, appropriate indirect
material costs and indirect labor costs, general and administrative costs and expenses for social amenities,
for voluntary social benefits and for occupational pensions. Borrowing costs have also been included in
production cost to the extent that they were attributable to the period of production.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the standard useful lives. Tangible fixed assets and
buildings are depreciated over the period of 3 to 33 years.

Straight-line depreciation rates are increased by 50% for fixed assets which are used throughout the year in
three-shift operations. Prepayments made are presented in the balance sheet at their nominal amount.

**Investment grants are reported separately at their nominal amount on the liabilities side under the special**
item ‘‘investment grants for assets’’ and are reversed in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets
for which the grants were awarded.

Low-value assets costing up to EUR 150.00 each are fully written off in the year of acquisition. Assets
which are capable of being used independently and which cost between EUR 150.00 and EUR 1,000.00 are
posted to a collective item in the year of acquisition; this collective item is reversed as a charge to profit or
loss over 5 years.

**Financial assets are measured at cost or, in the event of an expected permanent impairment, at their lower**
fair value as at the balance sheet date.

**Inventories are measured at cost, taking account of the lower of cost or market value. Appropriate**
valuation allowances are recorded for any identifiable risks resulting from above-average storage periods,
reduced recoverability and/or lower replacement costs. In all cases, fair value measurement was applied,
i. e. write-downs are recognized to the extent that the expected selling prices less costs incurred prior to
disposal result in a lower fair value.

**Raw materials, consumables and supplies are measured at actual cost or, taking account of the principle of**
lower of cost or market value, at lower market values as at the reporting date. Replacement parts for
machines are also recognized under raw materials, consumables and supplies. Appropriate valuation
allowances are applied to inventories which are obsolete, second-hand, damaged or slow-moving
Lump-sum valuation allowances amounting to KEUR 1,834 (previous year: KEUR 1,629) were applied to
replacement parts which are obsolete, second-hand or slow-moving.

**Work in process and finished goods are measured at production cost. Production cost comprises, if**
applicable, direct material costs, direct labor costs and special costs of production, appropriate and

necessary indirect material costs, indirect labor costs, depreciation and amortization of fixed assets that is
attributable to the production process and general and administrative costs and costs of occupational
pensions. Borrowing costs are not included in production cost.

**Receivables and other assets as well as the remaining assets are recognized at their principal amount or at**
their lower fair value as at the balance sheet date.

Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to receivables whose recoverability is associated with
identifiable risks; irrecoverable receivables are written off in full. To cover the general risk from trade
receivables, a global valuation allowance of 1% is recognized on domestic and foreign receivables (net of
value added tax) which are not subject to a specific valuation allowance.

**Cash-in-hand and bank balances are measured at their nominal amounts.**

Payments before the balance sheet date are recognized as **prepaid expenses to the extent that they**
represent an expense for a specific period of time after this date.

**Deferred taxes are recognized at their calculated amount. For further explanations, please refer to**
Chapter F.

**Subscribed capital is recognized at calculated amount.**

**Provisions are recognized at the settlement amount dictated by prudent business judgement. Provisions**
are recognized for liabilities of uncertain timing and/or amount as well as for losses from onerous
contracts. All risks arising up to the balance sheet date and identifiable up to the date of the preparation of
the financial statements have been taken into account. Provisions with a remaining term of more than one
year have been discounted using the average market interest rate of the last seven years applicable for their
remaining term, while pension provisions are discounted using the average market interest rate of the past
ten years.

**Liabilities are carried at their settlement amount.**

Payments received before the reporting date are recognized as **deferred income to the extent that they**
represent income for a specific time period after this date.

**II.** **Currency translation disclosures**

Receivables, other assets, cash and cash equivalents and provisions and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated during the year into euros. Measurement as at the balance sheet date is at the
December 31, 2017 closing rate, with the principle of lower of cost or market value, or higher settlement
amount, as appropriate, being taken into account for receivables and liabilities with a maturity of over one
year in accordance with section 256a HGB.

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from currency translation are recognized in other operating
income or expenses.

Translation of foreign subsidiary annual financial statements is carried out using the modified closing rate
method in accordance with section 308a HGB.

Currency translation differences from the consolidation of intercompany balances are recognized directly
in currency translation adjustments in equity.

A currency forward was concluded to hedge the currency risk of a loan granted by Progroup AG to the
subsidiary Prowell Ltd. in the amount of KGBP 7,146. A hedging relationship was established within the
meaning of section 254 of the HGB. The effective portions of the established hedging relationships are
accounted for in the financial statements using the so-called gross hedge presentation method
_(Durchbuchungsmethode). The currency forward contract has a negative market value of KEUR 35 as at_
December 31, 2017, which was recorded in currency translation adjustments in equity. The fair value was
derived from the closing rate and the risk-free interest rate based on the cost-of-carry method.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2017**

**F.** **DISCLOSURES AND EXPLANATIONS ON INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS IN THE**
**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT**

The financial year of all companies included in the consolidated financial statements corresponds to the
calendar year.

**I.** **Consolidated balance sheet**

**1.** **Fixed assets**

In connection with the acquisition of EnBW Propower GmbH in 2015 and related revaluation of acquired
fixed assets in correspondence with the capital consolidation, an operating license at acquisition cost of
KEUR 23,894 has been acquired. Subsequently, the operating license is amortized since 2015 over a
remaining useful life of 10 years. As at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is KEUR 19,257 with a
remaining term of 8 years.

The classification and movement in the financial year of the fixed asset accounts recognized in the
consolidated financial statements are separately presented as an appendix to the notes to the financial
statements in the fixed asset movement schedule.

Fixed asset production cost includes capitalized borrowing costs of KEUR 200 which were attributable to
the period of production. The capitalized borrowing costs were recognized in fixed assets in the line item
‘‘Construction in process’’. Interest capitalized in previous years was capitalized in tangible fixed assets,
primarily in buildings and technical equipment and machinery.

The value of construction in process as at December 31, 2017 is EUR 32.7 million (previous year: EUR
26.2 million), mainly resulting from the two production sites in Ellesmere Port, UK, and Drizzona, Italy.
This includes own work capitalized in the amount of EUR 1.7 million.

**2.** **Receivables and other assets**

As in the previous year, receivables and other assets do not include receivables due in more than one year.

As in the previous year, receivables from affiliated companies resulted exclusively from Group trading with
affiliated companies not fully consolidated.

Furthermore, other assets include input tax refund claims of the entire VAT group in an amount of KEUR
280 (previous year: KEUR 176), which in accordance with tax law provisions come into existence only after
the balance sheet date.

To determine deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts for assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges and deferred income, and their tax
bases, or based on tax loss carryforwards and interest carried forward, the amounts of the resulting tax
liability and benefit were measured at the individual companies’ tax rates (19% - 29.83%) at the point in
time when the differences are reversed; they were not discounted. Deferred tax assets relating to loss
carryforwards were taken into account if it was probable that the loss would be offset within the next five
years. Today’s assessment may change in accordance with the companies’ income positions and tax
legislation in future years and may require to be adjusted. In addition, deferred tax assets were recognized
in financial year 2017 on consolidation adjustments for the elimination of intercompany profits in
accordance with § 306 HGB as well as from initial consolidation outside profit or loss of EnBW
Propower GmbH acquired in 2015.

Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards KEUR 650 (previous year: KEUR 271) and eligible interest
carried forward (German earnings stripping rule; KEUR 3,479 (previous year: KEUR 9,340)) were fully
recognized because the underlying tax planning confirms that the amounts recognized could actually be
utilized to reduce tax liabilities in the next 5 years. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
reported net.

**4.** **Subscribed capital**

The share capital of the parent company is EUR 7,588,236.00 and is divided into 7,588,236 no-par value
shares with a calculated amount of subscribed capital of one euro each.

Distribution potential is based on the annual financial statements of Progroup AG. The articles of
association do not contain any restrictions on distributions. There is a statutory restriction on distributions
equivalent to the deferred tax assets in the annual financial statements of Progroup AG pursuant to
section 268(8) of the HGB in the amount of EUR 4.3 million as well as from the measurement of the
pension liabilities pursuant to section 253(6) of the HGB in the amount of EUR 0.2 million.

**5.** **Investment grants for fixed assets**

Investment grants for fixed assets are reported as a special reserve and are reversed on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for which the grants were awarded.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2017**

**6.** **Pension provisions**

Pension provisions are measured in accordance with the PUC method using Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck’s
2005 G mortality tables. All pension provisions were discounted at the market interest rate of the
preceding ten years published by Deutsche Bundesbank (10-year average interest rate) assuming that all
liabilities have a remaining maturity of 15 years (section 253(2) sent. 2 of the HGB).

Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions:

  - Pension increase: +2% (unchanged from 2016)

  - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2016)

   - Interest rate (10-year average): 3.68%

   - Interest rate (7-year average): 2.8%

Pension obligations for which provisions were required to be recognized amounted to KEUR 1,290 as at
the balance sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve
exclusively to settle liabilities from post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment
by third parties (so-called plan assets). A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan
asset. Plan assets that serve a specific purpose, have been pledged and are protected against insolvency
were measured based on information from the insurer as at December 31, 2017, at the asset value (KEUR
1,118; this corresponds to the fair value). The balance remaining after the offset with the carrying amount
of the pension provision (KEUR 173) is reported under ‘‘provisions for pensions’’. Effect on profit in 2017:

  - Interest expense from pension provision: KEUR 43

  - Interest income from plan assets: KEUR 22

The balance of interest expenses from the measurement of the pension provision (including the effect from
changes in interest) and interest income from the measurement of the plan assets was reported net in the
financial result. For the financial year, the balance between the measurement of the pension provision with
the 7-year average interest rate and the 10-year average interest rate amounts to KEUR 159 and is subject
to a distribution restriction at the level of the individual financial statements of Progroup AG.

**10. Deferred income**

This item comprises the difference (KEUR 3,236) between the settlement value and the payment amount
of the bond issued on December 8, 2015 (EUR 95 million) which will be released as adjustment to interest

compensation payment received in the amount of KEUR 355 for a steam supply contract which is released
to income over the contractual term until January 31, 2019.

**II.** **Consolidated income statement**

**9.** **Taxes on income**

This account mainly includes trade tax and corporate income tax for the current financial year in the
amount of KEUR 23,775 (previous year: KEUR 18,742) and refunds payments of trade tax and corporate
income tax for previous years in the amount of KEUR 8 (previous year: KEUR 456). It also includes
expenses arising from the adjustment of deferred tax assets in the amount of KEUR 4,228 (previous year:
KEUR 593). In the financial year 2017, the total amount of tax paid was KEUR 17,939.

**III. Other disclosures**

**1.** **Contingent liabilities, off-balance sheet transactions and other financial commitments**

In addition to the bonds (amount as at December 31, 2017: EUR 495 million), there still is a revolving
credit facility in the amount of EUR 50 million which was granted by a syndicate of banks (Super Senior
Revolving Credit Facility). As at December 31, 2017, the revolving credit facility was not utilized by the
company or any of its subsidiaries.

The bonds outstanding on the balance sheet date and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, which
can also be utilized by subsidiaries of Progroup AG, as well as the two loans in the amount of
PLN 177.6 million as at December 31, 2017 granted to Prowell sp. z o. o. by Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, are secured by pledging all shares in Progroup AG and the company shares in its main
subsidiaries, by pledging the bank deposits of the holding company, by assigning tangible fixed assets of the
subsidiaries, by granting real estate liens and by assignments of certain receivables. Furthermore, certain
covenants apply with regard to the loans and/or bonds.

The bonds, the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility as well as two loans granted to Prowell sp. z o. o. by
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in the amount of PLN 177.6 million are secured pari passu as mentioned
above. However, in an Intercreditor Agreement the creditors under the Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility were granted a priority satisfaction from any proceeds from realization.

Furthermore, the parent company has provided letters of comfort and guarantees for a total amount of
KEUR 29,921 to various suppliers of subsidiaries. The parent company also has assumed joint and several
co-liability vis-`a-vis CommerzFactoring GmbH for obligations of Prowell GmbH from a forfaiting
framework agreement.

The risk of enforcement should be regarded as low as none of the affiliates have a strained liquidity
position.

The companies lease forklifts and trucks under operating lease agreements so that these assets are not
recognized in the companies’ financial statements. As at December 31, 2017, the remaining obligations
from the lease agreements were KEUR 8,367. In addition, there were rental and lease agreements for
movable assets as well as for the rental of factory buildings and areas as at the balance sheet date. As at
December 31, 2017, the remaining obligations from these rental/lease agreements for subsequent years
were KEUR 19,193 (nominal amount). The advantage of these agreements is that a lower amount of
capital is tied up in the beginning than with a purchase and there is an absence of realization risk. Risks
could arise from the lease agreement periods if the assets can no longer be fully utilized, although there are
currently no indications of this.

As at the balance sheet date, there were steam supply contracts in place for the reliable supply of energy at
fixed prices which did not lead, however, to a recognition of a provision for contingent losses. These
agreements have terms of up to 8 years (December 31, 2025).

Due to specific contractual agreements for energy supply entered into as at the balance sheet date, total
obligations for the following year 2018 amount to KEUR 9,766 (December 31, 2016: KEUR 11,908).

In the previous year, there was an obligation from a consignment agreement amounting to KEUR 39.

The following auditor’s report (Best¨atigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with Section 322 of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and group
management report (Konzernlagebericht) of Progroup AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2017. The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To Progroup AG, Offenbach a.d. Queich

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, Offenbach a.d. Queich, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31. December 2017, and the
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow
statement for the financial year from 1. January to 31. December 2017, and notes to the consolidated
financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies presented therein. In addition,
we have audited the group management report of Progroup AG for the financial year from 1. January to
31. December 2017.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

  - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and
financial position of the Group as at 31. December 2017 and of its financial performance for the
financial year from 1. January to 31. December 2017 in compliance with German Legally Required
Accounting Principles, and

  - the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the
Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately
presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to Article 322 paragraph 3 sentence 1 Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code, we
declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated
financial statements and of the group management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer [Institute of Public Auditors in
Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in
the ‘‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report’’ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in
accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our
other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on
the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

_Other Information_

The executive directors are responsible for the other information.

The letter to investors is expected to be made available to us after the date of the auditor’s report.

Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information

  - is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or

F-69

   - otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial
Statements and the Group Management Report

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the
consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and
financial performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles.
In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit,
complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

   - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and
of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

-----

  - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report.
However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a
going concern.

   - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in
compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles.

   - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

  - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial
statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

  - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in
the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these
assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the
assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ
materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2016**

**A.** **GENERAL INFORMATION**

The consolidated financial statements of Progroup AG, comprising the consolidated balance sheet,
consolidated income statement, notes to the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated cash flow
statement and the consolidated statement of changes in equity, have been prepared in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Parts One and Two of the Third Book of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB—German
Commercial Code) and the supplementary provisions of the Aktiengesetz (AktG—German Stock
Corporation Act).

In the interest of greater clarity and transparency, below-the-line items to be reported for consolidated
balance sheet or consolidated income statement line items pursuant to the statutory provisions, as well as
disclosures and below-the-line items which may be reported either in the consolidated balance sheet and
consolidated income statement or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements have all been
reported in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Insofar, as individual consolidated balance sheet items and/or consolidated income statement items have
been combined as part of the statutory regulations so as to provide better transparency. The composition
of these line items is presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Effects from the first-time adoption of the German Accounting Standard Implementation Act
(Bilanzrichtlinienumsetzungsgesetz—BilRUG) which is mandatory with effect as at January 1, 2016
primarily concern the amended extent of the recognition of sales, of other operating income, of other
operating expenses as well as of the extraordinary net income/loss. The effects are explained separately
within the notes.

**B.** **SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS**

**I.** **Repayment of Bonds**

In 2016, early repayments in a total amount of EUR 75,000,000 were made for the floating rate bond
issued in 2015 (Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes; nominal value EUR 150,000,000; maturity date 2022;
at a floating interest rate equaling the 3-month-EURIBOR plus 4.5% p.a.). As at December 31, 2016, the
floating rate bond amounts to EUR 75,000,000. In addition, the fixed rate bond also issued in financial
year 2015 (Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes) amounting to EUR 250,000,000 as well as the Additional
Notes in an amount of EUR 95,000,000 at an interest rate of 5.125% p.a. continue to exist unchanged as at
the balance sheet date.

**II.** **Investments in the construction of a new Prowell plant**

With effect of December 1, 2015, Progroup entered into a long-term framework and cooperation
agreement for the construction of a further corrugated board plant in the southwest of Poland with one of
our key customers. Since the beginning of 2016, a new corrugated board plant (PW 10) is being built in the
southwest of Poland in direct vicinity to our customer at the Trzcinica/Poland location. In this context,
agreements with suppliers for approximately EUR 26.6 million were entered into until mid-February 2017,
of which EUR 22.1 million were already recognized as at December 31, 2016 as construction in progress
for rendered services as well as for the property that has already been acquired. Completion of the
production building and commencement of production operations at this location are scheduled for the
first quarter of 2017. For the financing of the new plant, Prowell sp. z o.o. entered into a loan agreement
for a fixed rate loan in an amount of PLN 107 million with Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Frankfurt,
on May 31, 2016. Of this loan, PLN 9 million have already been used as at December 31, 2016.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2016**

With effect of December 31, 2015, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary Propower GmbH, which was
acquired at that date, were consolidated for the first time (‘‘Mitternachtsklausel’’). Accordingly, the
contributions to earnings attributable to this company are contained in the consolidated income statement
for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2016 for the first time.

**D.** **CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES**

Acquisitions made until December 31, 2009 continue to be accounted for in accordance with section 66(3)
of the Einf¨uhrungsgesetz zum Handelsgesetzbuch (EGHGB—Introductory Act to the German
Commercial Code), using the carrying amount method under section 301(1) no. 1 of the HGB (former
version) by eliminating the cost of the equity investments against the proportionate amount that these
shares represent in the equity of the subsidiaries as at January 1, 1999, January 1, 2001, January 1, 2002,
January 1, 2006 and September 12, 2006.

Acquisitions made after December 31, 2009 are accounted for in accordance with section 301(1) no. 1 of
the HGB (as amended) using the purchase method. With this method, the acquisition cost of the investments is eliminated against the equity reflecting the fair value of the assets, liabilities, deferrals and special
items to be included in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.

Two affiliated companies have not been consolidated as permitted under section 296(2) of the HGB. These
companies are not material to the presentation of a true and fair view of the group’s net assets, financial
position and results of operation as sales and total assets of these companies amount to less than 1% of
consolidated sales and consolidated total assets. Consolidation as an associate has also been dispensed with
on the grounds of immateriality as permitted under section 311(2) of the HGB. Shares in these companies
are recognized at amortized cost. The companies are listed by name in section F. III. 4. of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

Receivables and liabilities between consolidated companies have been eliminated, with receivables and
liabilities amounting to KEUR 814,333 having been eliminated outside profit or loss.

In financial year 2016, intercompany profits from Propapier PM1 GmbH’s and Propapier PM2 GmbH’s
paper deliveries to affiliated companies amounting to KEUR 1,649 were eliminated through profit or loss.
Intra-group sales, intra-group other operating income and interest income have been eliminated against
corresponding expenses, with expenses and income amounting to KEUR 401,462 having been eliminated.

Deferred taxes are generally recognized for consolidation adjustments which are recognized through profit
or loss. In 2016 and 2015, consolidation adjustments through profit or loss related exclusively to the
elimination of intercompany profits. Deferred tax assets of KEUR 362 were recognized as at December 31,
2016 on eliminated intercompany profits of KEUR 1,213 (as at December 31, 2016). Eliminated
intercompany profits as at December 31, 2015 amounted to KEUR 2,862. The deferred tax assets
recognized for these amounted to KEUR 854 as at December 31, 2015 and were prior-period related
(deferred) tax income.

**E.** **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**I.** **Disclosure of accounting policies applied**

**Intangible assets are measured at cost less amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their**
standard useful lives. The intangible assets are amortized over a useful life of 3 to 10 years.

**Tangible fixed assets are measured at purchase and production cost less depreciation.**

Production cost comprises, if applicable, direct material costs, direct labor costs and special costs of
production, appropriate indirect material costs and indirect labor costs, general and administrative costs
and expenses for social amenities, for voluntary social benefits and for occupational pensions. Borrowing

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2016**

costs have also been included in production cost to the extent that they were attributable to the period of
production.

The corrugator in the new plant in Pl¨ossberg, which is financed by a finance lease agreement, is presented
in the tangible fixed assets as Prowell GmbH is considered to be the economic owner.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over their standard useful lives. Tangible fixed assets and
buildings are depreciated over the period of 3 to 33 years.

Straight-line depreciation rates are increased by 50% for fixed assets which are used throughout the year in
three-shift operations. Prepayments made are presented in the balance sheet at their nominal amount.

**Investment grants are reported separately at their nominal amount on the liabilities side under the special**
item ‘‘investment grants for assets’’ and are reversed in accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets
for which the grants were awarded.

Low-value assets costing up to EUR 150 each are fully written off in the year of acquisition. Assets which
are capable of being used independently and which cost between EUR 150 and EUR 1,000 are posted to a
collective item in the year of acquisition; this collective item is reversed as a charge to profit or loss over
5 years.

**Financial assets are measured at cost or, in the event of an expected permanent impairment, at their lower**
fair value as at the balance sheet date.

**Raw materials, consumables and supplies are measured at actual cost or, taking account of the principle of**
lower of cost or market value, at lower market values as at the reporting date. Appropriate valuation
allowances amounting to KEUR 1,629 (previous year: KEUR 1,350) are applied to inventories which are
obsolete, second-hand, damaged or slow-moving.

**Work in process and finished goods are measured at production cost. Production cost comprises, if**
applicable, direct material costs, direct labor costs and special costs of production, appropriate and
necessary indirect material costs, indirect labor costs, depreciation and amortization of fixed assets that is
attributable to the production process and general and administrative costs and costs of occupational
pensions. Borrowing costs are not included in production cost.

**Receivables and other assets as well as the remaining assets are recognized at their principal amount or at**
their lower fair value as at the balance sheet date.

Appropriate valuation allowances are applied to receivables whose recoverability is associated with
identifiable risks; irrecoverable receivables are written off in full.

To cover the general risk from trade receivables, a global valuation allowance of 1% is recognized on
domestic and foreign receivables (net of value added tax) which are not subject to a specific valuation
allowance.

**Cash-in-hand and bank balances are measured at their nominal amounts.**

Payments before the balance sheet date are recognized as **prepaid expenses to the extent that they**
represent an expense for a specific period of time after this date.

**Deferred taxes are recognized at their calculated amount. For further explanations, please refer to**
Chapter F.

**Subscribed capital is recognized at calculated amount.**

**Provisions are recognized at the settlement amount dictated by prudent business judgement. All risks**
arising up to the balance sheet date and identifiable up to the date of the preparation of the financial
statements have been taken into account. Provisions with a remaining term of more than one year have
been discounted at the average market interest rate corresponding to their remaining maturity.

Receivables, other assets, cash and cash equivalents and provisions and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated during the year at the prior-month average euro rate. Measurement as at the
balance sheet date is at the December 31, 2016 closing rate, with the principle of lower of cost or market
value, or higher settlement amount, as appropriate, being taken into account for receivables and liabilities
with a maturity of over one year in accordance with section 256a HGB.

Foreign exchange gains or losses arising from currency translation are recognized in other operating
income or expenses.

Translation of foreign subsidiary annual financial statements is carried out using the modified closing rate
method in accordance with section 308a HGB.

Currency translation differences from the consolidation of intercompany balances are recognized directly
in currency translation adjustments in equity.

**CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT**

The reporting date for all companies included in the consolidated financial statements is December 31.

**I.** **Consolidated balance sheet**

**1.** **Fixed assets**

In connection with the acquisition of EnBW Propower GmbH in 2015 and related revaluation of acquired
fixed assets in correspondence with the capital consolidation, an operating license at acquisition cost of
KEUR 23,894 has been acquired. Subsequently, the operating license is amortized since 2015 over a
remaining useful life of 10 years. As at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount is KEUR 21,664 with a
remaining term of 9 years.

The classification and movement in the financial year of the fixed asset accounts recognized in the
consolidated financial statements are separately presented as an appendix to the notes to the financial
statements in the fixed asset movement schedule.

Fixed asset production cost includes capitalized borrowing costs of KEUR 20 which were attributable to
the period of production. On the balance sheet date, total borrowing costs in an amount of KEUR 20,201
were capitalized (previous year: KEUR 20,181). The capitalized borrowing costs were recognized in fixed
assets in the line item ‘‘Construction in progress’’. Interest capitalized in previous years were capitalized in
tangible fixed assets, primarily in buildings and technical equipment and machinery.

**2.** **Receivables and other assets**

Receivables and other assets no longer include receivables due in more than one year (previous year:
KEUR 42).

As in the previous year, receivables from affiliated companies resulted exclusively from Group trading.

Furthermore, other assets include input tax refund claims of the entire VAT group in an amount of
KEUR 176 (previous year: KEUR 396), which in accordance with tax law provisions come into existence

To determine deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts for assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges and deferred income, and their tax
bases, or based on tax loss carryforwards and interest carried forward, the amounts of the resulting tax
liability and benefit were measured at the individual companies’ tax rates (19% - 29.83%) at the point in
time when the differences are reversed; they were not discounted. Deferred tax assets relating to loss
carryforwards were taken into account if it was probable that the loss would be offset within the next five
years. Today’s assessment may change in accordance with the companies’ income positions and tax
legislation in future years and may require to be adjusted. In addition, deferred tax assets were recognized
in financial year 2016 on consolidation adjustments for the elimination of intercompany profits in
accordance with § 306 HGB.

Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards KEUR 271 (previous year: KEUR 189) and eligible interest
carried forward (German earnings stripping rule; KEUR 9,340 (previous year: KEUR 11,281)) were fully
recognized because the underlying tax planning confirms that the amounts recognized could actually be
utilized to reduce tax liabilities in the next 5 years.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are reported net.

**4.** **Subscribed capital**

The share capital of the parent company is EUR 7,588,236.00 and is divided into 7,588,236 no-par value
shares with a calculated amount of subscribed capital of one euro each.

Distribution potential is based on the annual financial statements of Progroup AG. The articles of
association do not contain any restrictions on distributions. There is a statutory restriction on distributions
equivalent to the deferred tax assets in the annual financial statements of Progroup AG in the amount of
EUR 10.3 million as well as from the measurement of the pension liabilities in the amount of
EUR 0.1 million. The restriction on distribution in the Group has been calculated at EUR 5.2 million.

**5.** **Investment grants for fixed assets**

Investment grants for fixed assets are reported as a special reserve and are reversed on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the useful lives of the fixed assets for which the grants were awarded.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2016**

**6.** **Pension provisions**

Pension provisions are measured in accordance with the PUC method using Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck’s
2005 G mortality tables. In accordance with the Directive on credit agreements for consumers relating to
residential immovable property and amending directives and regulations (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der
Wohnimmobilienkreditrichtlinie und zur Anderung handelsrechtlicher Vorschriften) dated March 17,[¨]
2016, all pension provisions were discounted at the market interest rate of the preceding ten years
published by Deutsche Bundesbank (10-year average interest rate) assuming that all liabilities have a
remaining maturity of 15 years (§ 253 para. 2 sent. 2 HGB). In the previous year the average market rate of
the last seven years was used for discounting.

Measurement of pension provisions is based on the following assumptions:

  - Pension increase: +2% (unchanged from 2015)

  - Salary increase: 0% (unchanged from 2015)

   - Interest rate (10-year average): 4.03%

   - Interest rate (7-year average): 3.28%

Pension obligations for which provisions were required to be recognized amounted to KEUR 1,065 as at
the balance sheet date (10-year average rate). These obligations are offset against assets that serve
exclusively to settle liabilities from post-employment benefit obligations and are exempt from attachment
by third parties (so-called plan assets). A pledged pension liability insurance policy was classified as a plan
asset. Plan assets that serve a specific purpose, have been pledged and are protected against insolvency
were measured based on information from the insurer as at December 31, 2016, at the asset value
(KEUR 1,030; this corresponds to the fair value). The balance remaining amount after the offset with the
carrying amount of the pension provision (KEUR 35) is reported under ‘‘provisions for pensions’’. Effect
on profit in 2016:

  - Interest expense from pension provision: KEUR 39

  - Interest income from plan assets: KEUR 19

The balance of interest expenses from the measurement of the pension provision (including the effect from
changes in interest) and interest income from the measurement of the plan assets was reported net in the
financial result. For the financial year, the balance between the measurement of the pension provision with
the 7-year average interest rate and the 10-year average interest rate amounts to KEUR 124 and is subject
to a distribution restriction at the level of the individual financial statements of Progroup AG.

**FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2016**

Besides the corporate financing through the issuance of bonds (EUR 420 million as at December 31, 2016)
on April 30, 2015 and December 8, 2015, a revolving credit facility amounting to EUR 50 million was

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**FOR FINANCIAL YEAR 2016**

**10. Taxes on income**

This account mainly includes trade tax and corporate income tax for the current financial year in the
amount of KEUR 18,742 (previous year: KEUR 11,931) and refunds payments of trade tax and corporate
income tax for previous years in the amount of KEUR 456 (previous year: KEUR 187). It also includes
expenses arising from the adjustment of deferred tax assets in the amount of KEUR 593 (previous year:
KEUR 68). In the financial year 2016, the total amount of tax paid was KEUR 10,631.

**III. Other disclosures**

**1.** **Contingent liabilities, off-balance sheet transactions and other financial commitments**

In context of the refinancing carried out in 2015, a revolving credit facility (Super Senior Revolving Credit
Facility) amounting to EUR 50 million was granted by a syndicate of banks in addition to the issuance of
the bonds (amount as at December 31, 2016: EUR 420 million). As at December 31, 2016, the revolving
credit facility was not utilized by the company or any of its subsidiaries.

The bonds outstanding on the balance sheet date and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility, which
can also be utilized by subsidiaries of Progroup AG, are secured by pledging all shares in Progroup AG and
the company shares in its main subsidiaries, by pledging the bank deposits of the holding company, by
assigning tangible fixed assets of the subsidiaries, by granting real estate liens and assignments of certain
receivables. Furthermore, certain covenants apply with regard to the loans and/or bonds.

The bonds and the Super Senior Revolving Credit Facility as well as two loans granted to Prowell sp. z o.o.
by Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft in the amount of PLN 116 million (PLN I and PLN II loan) are
secured pari passu as mentioned above. However, in an Intercreditor Agreement the creditors were
granted a priority satisfaction from any proceeds from realization.

Furthermore, the parent company has provided letters of comfort and guarantees for a total amount of
KEUR 18,265 to various suppliers of subsidiaries. Furthermore, the parent company has assumed joint and
several co-liability vis-`a-vis CommerzFactoring GmbH for obligations of Prowell GmbH from a forfaiting
framework agreement.

The risk of enforcement should be regarded as low as none of the affiliates have a strained liquidity
position.

The companies lease forklifts and trucks under operating lease agreements so that these assets are not
recognized in the companies’ financial statements. As at December 31, 2016, the remaining obligations
from the lease agreements were KEUR 8,342. In addition, there were rental and lease agreements for
movable assets as well as for the rental of factory buildings and areas as at the balance sheet date. As at
December 31, 2016, the remaining obligations from these rental/lease agreements for subsequent years
were KEUR 16,551 (nominal amount). The advantage of these agreements is that a lower amount of
capital is tied up in the beginning than with a purchase and there is an absence of realization risk. Risks
could arise from the lease agreement periods if the assets can no longer be fully utilized, although there are
currently no indications of this.

As at the balance sheet date, there were steam supply contracts in place for the reliable supply of energy at
fixed prices which did not lead, however, to a recognition of a provision for contingent losses. These
agreements have terms of up to 9 years (December 31, 2025).

Due to specific contractual agreements entered into as at the balance sheet date, total obligations for the
following year 2017 amount to KEUR 11,908 (December 31, 2015: KEUR 11,587).

As at December 31, 2016, there was a remaining obligation from a consignment agreement amounting to
KEUR 39 (December 31, 2015: KEUR 29).

In addition, as at the balance sheet date there were contractual purchase commitments for waste paper and
corrugated board base paper supplies; respective commitments for the following year are KEUR 46,485

The following auditor’s report (Best¨atigungsvermerk) has been issued in accordance with Section 322 of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial statements and group
management report (Konzernlagebericht) of Progroup AG as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2016. The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum.

**Auditor’s Report**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by Progroup AG, Offenbach a. d. Queich,
Germany, comprising the balance sheet, the income statement, notes, cash flow and the statement of
changes in equity to the consolidated financial statements, together with the group management report for
the business year from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements and the group management report in accordance with German commercial is the
responsibility of the parent Company’s Board of Managing Directors. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the group management report based on our audit.

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § (Article) 317 HGB
(‘‘Handelsgesetzbuch’’: ‘‘German Commercial Code’’) and German generally accepted standards for the
audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr¨ufer (Institute of Public
Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that
misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with (German) principles of proper
accounting and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the
business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and expectations as to possible
misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the
accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements and the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the
framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the companies
included in consolidation, the determination of the companies to be included in consolidation, the
accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the Company’s Board of
Managing Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements
and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audit has not led to any reservations.

In our opinion based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply with the
legal requirements and give a true and fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of
operations of the Group in accordance with (German) principles of proper accounting. The group
management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and complies with the legal
requirements and as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group’s position and suitably presents the
opportunities and risks of future development.
