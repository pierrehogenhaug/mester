66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,Business overview,"We are one of the leading limited assortment discount retailers in the UK based on number of stores and sales with a growing presence in France and a total of 1,097 stores in our Group. We trade under the B&M and Heron Foods brands in the UK, which have 686 and 307 stores, respectively, and the B&M brand in France, which has 104 stores. Our UK business is one of the largest companies in the fast growing general merchandise discount retail market in the UK, which we believe is having a disruptive impact on the overall UK retail market. We believe that our stores offer a compelling customer proposition, combining leading branded fast-moving consumer goods (“FMCG”) products at attractive prices with a strong non-grocery product offering which together deliver great value to customers over a wide range of price points. We stock a mix of grocery (typically branded FMCG products) and non-grocery products and our focus is on general merchandise. We operate a flexible store format and our dynamic trading strategy flexes our product ranges regularly to take advantage of seasonal shifts in customer demand over the course of each year. Under this flexible category and space management model, the layout and SKU range of each B&M store is regularly adjusted in order to maximize the space allocated to seasonal and other faster-moving merchandise. In June 2014, B&M was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and in June 2015, B&M was admitted to the FTSE 250 index. In September 2020, B&M was promoted to the FTSE 100 index. As of September 25, 2021, the Issuer had a market capitalization of £6.0 billion. In August 2017, we acquired Heron Foods, a discount convenience retailer predominantly based in the North of England. The acquisition has enabled us to develop and roll out a complementary, proven and profitable discount convenience food brand with its own dedicated buying and merchandising team. In October 2018, we acquired Babou, a general merchandise retailer with stores in a number of regions in France. As of the date of this Offering Circular, all of our Babou stores except for one are now re-branded to the B&M banner. Our strategy is to apply our direct product sourcing and limited assortment SKU model while refining B&M France’s product offering. In March 2020, we completed the sale of our Jawoll business to a private equity led buyer consortium. This sale was the culmination of a strategic review process that began in late 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.2,Financial overview,"For the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021, we generated revenue of £2,268.0 million. For the 26 weeks ended September 26, 2020, we generated revenue of £2,242.1 million. This represents an increase of 1.2% on an actual basis and a 1.4% increase on a constant currency basis. Our overall adjusted gross margin for the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 increased to 37.4% (as compared to 35.7% for the 26 ----- weeks ended September 26, 2020) with performance of higher-margin General Merchandise and Seasonal categories particularly strong, with high sell-through rates leading to limited end-of-season markdowns. For the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021, our adjusted operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by 11.9% to £565.9 million (including new store pre-opening costs) and were 25.0% as a percentage of revenue, as compared to 22.6% for the 26 weeks ended September 26, 2020. Depreciation and amortization expenses (excluding adjusting items) increased by 6.7% to £32.1 million, reflecting the increased number of stores as a result of our new store opening program. Our adjusted EBITDA decreased by 4.6% to £282.2 million, as compared to £295.6 million for the 26 weeks ended September 26, 2020; however, this represents an increase of 86.4% as compared to our adjusted EBITDA for the 26 weeks ended 28 September 2019. For the two-year period between the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 and the 26 weeks ended 28 September 2019, our adjusted EBITDA has grown more than three times faster than our revenue, demonstrating strong growth from our pre-Covid pandemic levels. For the financial year 2021, we generated revenue of £4,801.4 million, partly as a result of most of our stores staying open during the lockdown periods implemented in the UK and France in response to the Covid pandemic, in contrast to a number of our peers. For the financial year 2020, we generated revenue of £3,813.4 million. This represents an increase of 25.9% on an actual basis and a 25.7% increase on a constant currency basis. Our overall adjusted gross margin for the financial year 2021 increased to 36.7% (as compared to 33.8% for the financial year 2020), driven by a combination of a mix shift towards higher margin general merchandise sales and, in particular, an unprecedented level of sell-through on seasonal lines due to the elevated demand. For the financial year 2021, our adjusted operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by 20.1% to £1,137.1 million and were 23.7% as a percentage of revenue, as compared to 24.8% for the financial year 2020. Depreciation and amortization expenses (excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and adjusting items) increased by 8.2% to £62.4 million, reflecting the ongoing investment in new store across all fascias. Our adjusted EBITDA for the financial year 2021 increased by 83.0% to £626.4 million, compared to £342.3 million for the financial year 20. In the UK, B&M revenues increased by 1.3% to £1,909.5 million for the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021, primarily driven by our new store opening program and £24.0 million from wholesale revenue (an increase of £3.6 million as compared to the 26 weeks ended September 26, 2020), which offset a decrease in UK Like-for-Like revenues of 5.0%. Despite such decrease to our UK Like-for-Like revenues over a oneyear period, our UK Like-for-Like revenues for the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 increased by 16.8% as compared to the 26 weeks ended September 28, 2019, with our sales densities significantly higher than pre-Covid pandemic levels as a result of the our retention of new customers acquired during the financial year 2021, the ongoing strength of our higher ticker General Merchandise categories generating a favourable mix shift and our implementation of certain “self-help” measures, such as providing a broader product range and improving our in-store execution. In the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021, there were 14 gross new B&M store openings and nine closures, with two of the closures being relocations. Heron Foods store revenues reduced to £203.1 million in the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 as compared to £216.2 million in the 26 weeks ended September 26, 2020. For the financial year 2021, B&M revenues increased by 29.9% to £4,077.6 million, primarily driven by an increase in UK Like-for-Like revenues of 23.8%, as well as our new store opening program, including both the annualisation of revenues from the 36 net new store openings in financial year 2020 and the 25 net new store openings in financial year 2021, and £47.4 million from wholesale revenue (an increase of £19.7 million as compared to the financial year 2020). In the financial year 2021, there were 43 gross new B&M store openings and 18 closures, with five of the closures being relocations. Heron Foods store revenues grew to £414.8 million in the financial year 2021 as compared to £389.9 million in the financial year 2020; with neighbourhood locations performing particularly well as consumers sought to shop locally for their everyday essentials. In France, B&M France’s revenues increased by 10.6% to £155.4 million for the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 as compared to £140.6 million for the 26 weeks ended September 26, 2020, despite six weeks of ‘soft lockdown’ restrictions in force at the start of the financial year during which only essential goods could be sold. Our product offerings are now very closely aligned with the UK B&M product offerings. We plan reductions in clothing sales and to strengthen our General Merchandise categories, including Homewares and Gardening. This product alignment has complemented our re-branding program, whereby now all French stores except for one are now under the B&M banner. B&M France’s adjusted EBITDA ----- increased to £11.4 million for the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 as compared to adjusted EBITDA of £2.7 million for the 26 weeks ended September 26, 2020, and its adjusted EBITDA margin for the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 was 7.3%. For the financial year 2021, B&M France’s revenues increased by 9.1% to £309.1 million as compared to £283.4 million for the financial year 2020, despite many stores being closed for up to 10 weeks throughout the year as a result of the French government’s response to the Covid19 pandemic. For those stores that did remain open, they were restricted to selling “essential” items only and, therefore, generated significantly lower revenues during those weeks. During the periods when the French stores were fully open, performance was strong, driven by a combination of both our continued range optimisation work and the positive impact from re-branding 35 stores from Babou to the B&M banner during the financial year 2021, all of which progressed well despite the disruption caused by multiple lockdowns. B&M France’s adjusted EBITDA increased to £11.1 million for the financial year 2021 as compared to negative adjusted EBITDA of £3.0 million for the financial year 2020, and its adjusted EBITDA margin for the financial year 2021 was 3.6%.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.3,Strategic overview,"Our value-led retailing model has proven to be resilient to the challenges posed by Covid-19 and our strategy for driving sustainable growth in revenues, earnings and free cashflow remains unchanged. Throughout the financial year 2021, our priority has been the wellbeing of colleagues and customers, having worked hard to maintain a safe working and shopping environment. At the same time, from a strategic standpoint, there has been a clear focus on delivering value for money, product ranges which appeal to a broader section of society, and improved in-store execution. In addition, we have continued to execute our UK expansion strategy despite disruptions to the construction sectors in the UK attributed to supply chain disruption, including a lack of logistic capacity, and rising costs of building materials. Our long term target of 950 UK B&M stores remains unchanged, and we believe that our variety retail model, well-invested infrastructure and store network means we are well positioned to deal with challenges posed by Covid-19. In France, the transformation of the Babou business we acquired in 2018 to a model similar to B&M and is close to completion, with all of our B&M France stores except for one now having been re-branded from the Babou franchise to the B&M fascia, despite delays caused by the disruption from Covid-19. We are now focused on developing our B&M France network going forward. All three Group businesses have demonstrated an ability to respond quickly to changing circumstances. They coped well with uncertainty and disruption, be that sustained elevated demand in the UK or multiple periods of store closures and restrictions in France.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,"Unique, disruptive business model","We have a disruptive sourcing process which we believe leads to significant savings for consumers. As part of our sourcing strategy, we purchase a large share of our products directly from the manufacturer. This is mainly driven by our disruptive sourcing process, which enables us to significantly reduce the final price paid by the customer by having a direct relationship with the producers. Overall, the costs of partnering with exporters and distributors could lead to a materially higher final price and we believe this gives us an advantage over our competitors using a more traditional retail sourcing process. Our scale and strong growth over a number of years makes us an attractive counterparty for major branded FMCG producers. In particular, our direct sourcing model and strong supplier relationships make us more agile and responsive ----- than our competitors, which has enabled us to minimize the impact of disruption from the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, we have a long-standing shipping partner for goods sourced out of Asia which helped us ensure that service levels were not materially compromised in 2021. We also ordered our seasonal stock for the 2021 Christmas period earlier than normal to ensure we are not affected by global supply issues. Our products are either branded (in the case of grocery and specific portions of the general merchandise product category, such as toys) or unbranded (in the case of the rest of the general merchandise products). Our close relationships with our suppliers mean that we are able to bring new SKUs to market rapidly, enabling us to move our inventory efficiently. Our skilled buying team is able to deliver a steady stream of around 100 new lines each week to our stores. Benefiting from our robust in-house design capabilities and our strong relationships with the suppliers, we are able to quickly introduce new products in our shelves and rapidly decide whether to further develop the new items, produce them on a larger scale or discontinue them. It can take us less than nine weeks to go from initial design to selling the item at B&M stores in the UK, underpinning our ability to bring new products to market quickly. We have a disciplined approach focused on best-selling products, while maintaining lower stock volumes than specialist retailers. In addition, we carefully optimise our floor space to align it with seasonal trading patterns and to efficiently manage our stock levels. This allows us to avoid seasonal low trading periods, unlike single category specialist retailers whose product offering is largely fixed throughout the year. Maintaining our competitive value led price model also entails developing and retaining strong long-term supplier relationships. Many of our suppliers have grown and developed into established trading relationships with us over the many years of supplying our Group businesses. However, we do not heavily rely on any single supplier, with our top five suppliers accounting for only approximately 12% of our total purchases. Overall, we believe that our ability to deliver value across a variety of product categories, combined with the range of items within each product line being limited to best sellers and updated regularly, is why our customers choose to keep returning to our stores.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,Modern store network and well-invested infrastructure,"We have continued to execute our UK store expansion strategy notwithstanding the challenges of Covid19 to the construction and contracting sector. There have been some modest delays in the timing of the handover of premises by landlords at a site specific level, but otherwise the store estate expansion strategy has and will continue to be implemented. Our network of over 1,000 well-located and well-invested stores in the UK and France are in convenient locations in modern retail parks, popular district centers and high streets. Our stores are generally in locations with easy access by car or other independent means of travel, as opposed to being dependent on city public transport links, making them well suited to the needs of customers during the Covid-19 pandemic. The location of our stores, close to where our customers live, and their ease of access have proved popular with our customers who enjoy the convenience on their routine shops. In addition, we believe that our comparatively large scale gives us an advantage over many of our competitors in the UK general merchandise discount sector. The majority of our stores are leases and require low initial investment. The payback period for our new stores has historically been eight to nine months, but given recent step-up in sales densities and the fact that our new stores do not typically need a “maturity curve” and are immediately profitable, the payback period for our new stores opened since the start of the financial year 2020 has been even more attractive. In addition, the store contribution (i.e., gross profit less directly attributable store costs) of our new stores opened during the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 is 21.9%, outperforming our average B&M UK store contribution of 20.9%. We actively manage our lease arrangements and monitor locations for new stores and potential store relocations that we believe could be profitable. ----- There is significant “whitespace” for the rolling out new stores in the UK, based on the number of B&M stores per 100,000 people, and we have a long-term target of 950 B&M stores in the UK, targeting in particular “out of town” locations with convenient parking and space for a garden center over the high street. We have built our existing distribution network with this target in mind. We have a modern supply chain and scalable infrastructure to support the operations and targeted growth of a number of stores. In the UK, we operate a modern well-invested warehouse and distribution system for our B&M stores. In January 2020 we opened a state of the art distribution center in Bedford, UK which provides B&M with a further one million square foot of warehouse capacity. The facility was developed at a cost of £103.7 million and its sale and leaseback has released £149.5 million of capital (net of UK corporation tax on the development profit) into the Group. The site is already supporting approximately 250 UK B&M stores with capacity to service at least a further 50 stores. We also operate an in-house fleet of heavy goods vehicles for B&M store deliveries and intra-warehouse transfers in the UK. In France, following a number of successful trials, as of the date of this Offering Circular we have now rebranded all but one of the B&M France stores from the Babou franchise to the B&M fascia. This has involved re-fits of the stores and new layouts with a consistent B&M format for the French Grocery and General Merchandise product offering to customers. We are now focused on developing our B&M France network going forward. Our French stores are supported by three distribution centers in Cournon D’Auvergne with a combined area of 63,701 square metres and one distribution center in Clermont-Ferrand with an area of 3,825 square metres, and we are continuing to evolve our product proposition in France to closer alignment with the UK business. Progress has also been made with the French business sourcing general merchandising lines from the Group’s supply network in China. With Covid-19 preventing foreign travel to trade fairs and suppliers, our trading teams turned a necessity into a competitive strength. By investing in areas such as product design and development, visual merchandising and co-ordination across different categories to create a more aspirational set of product ranges, our trading teams have become less dependent on factories for development of new products. In becoming more self-reliant and capable of delivering on-trend product ranges, we believe that this area of our business has emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic in an even stronger position than before. At store level, we have gradually been rolling out a new digital technology compatible Workforce Management System, having been paused during the initial Covid-19 outbreak, which will help plan work rotas for our colleagues. This investment will enable a more agile approach to store rotas, as well as creating efficiencies through the reduction of paper-based processes. This new capability is indicative of the Group’s commitment to improve existing systems for the benefit of both the businesses and our colleagues. Having adopted this new best in class approach to managing store hours, we believe it will help our business grow sustainably by servicing customer demand in a cost-efficient way.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Structurally growing underlying market,"The UK discount sector in which we operate has experienced strong growth since 2014. From 2014 to 2020, based on management experience, we believe that the UK discount sector outpaced growth in the general UK retail market with a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) approximately 10% higher than the CAGR of the general UK retail market over the same period. We believe this was driven by positive trends on both the demand side, such as consumer income squeeze and demand for convenience/ease of shopping, as well as the supply side, such as including the availability of low-cost real estate and support from FMCG manufacturers. Additionally, the general merchandise discount retail sector has proved generally resilient to changes in economic cycles. We believe there has also been a shift in consumer behaviour in recent years, with more consumers, including from higher household income brackets, using discount stores more often. We believe that consumers recognize that a price gap exists between value retailers and retail supermarkets across food, FMCG and homeware goods, and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the growing value ----- retailer market. We believe that we benefit by a shift from specialist retailers during challenging economic periods, and growth in footfall during more benign economic periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Our growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA has been accompanied by strong cash generation, leading to a lowering of our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio over the last five financial years, from 1.71x in the financial year 2017 to 0.8x in the financial year 2021, excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and the disposal of Jawoll. This is despite the acquisitions of Heron Foods in 2017 and Babou in 2018, as well as continued investment in store roll out. The number of our Group stores has continually increased over the past five years, from 499 in the financial year 2016 to 1,091 in the financial year 2021 (a CAGR of 16.9%). We have achieved consistent year-on-year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth for over 15 years with a CAGR of 30.5% and 45.8%, respectively, between 2005 and 2021, and we believe we have proven ourselves to be resilient during adverse market conditions. For example, during the period of Brexit-related uncertainly in financial year 2017 our revenue increased by 18% and our UK Like-for-Like revenue increased by 3.3%, excluding the impact of IFRS 16 and the disposal of Jawoll, while we have experienced minimal disruption to our operations post-Brexit given that the majority of our products are sourced from Asia. Similarly, for the financial year 2021, our revenue increased by 25.9% and our UK Like-for-Like revenue increased by 23.8% as compared to the financial year 2020, despite the uncertainties posed by Covid-19. Compared to our pre-pandemic levels, our adjusted EBITDA for the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 increased by 86.4% as compared the 26 weeks ended 28 September 2019, while our UK Like-for-Like revenues increased by 16.8% during the same period. Since our initial public offering in June 2014, we have regularly returned capital to our shareholders by way of dividends, including the payment of a special dividend in April 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Our experienced management team ensure that we have a robust and effective corporate governance and risk management structures and processes in place. Their experience across a range of international markets allows them to provide constructive challenges to our management team and ensures that they provide the best outcomes for our all our stakeholders in how we operate our businesses, provide value and manage risk appropriately.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.6,,"We believe that our competitiveness and our profitability is driven by our relentless discipline around keeping costs low, buying large volumes per product line directly from factories rather than through intermediaries, and stocking only a limited assortment of the best-selling items. Specifically, we believe that we have a competitive advantage because of the following key strengths, which will enable us to take advantage of current and future growth opportunities:",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.1,Delivering great value for our customers,"We intend to continue executing our core strategy of providing customers with great value for money across a broad range of product categories, with the range of items within each product line being limited to best sellers. With Covid-19 continuing to have a profound impact on the daily lives of everyone, value and convenience are likely to remain important to customers when deciding where to shop. We believe, therefore, that our proposition should remain highly relevant to shoppers as we look to continue to grow our business in the future. Competitive pricing is at the heart of our business model and our focus remains on providing a limited assortment of the best-selling products, including leading brands at bargain prices. In addition, we will continue to look for opportunities in general merchandise categories where other specialist category retailers are less price-competitive, which we see as an opportunity given some of them have downsized their bricks and mortar estates. By targeting these categories, we see potential to grow our market share further through our value-led model. We are also investing in the skills and experience we have in our own trading teams, in areas such as product design and visual merchandising, to ensure that we are always selecting the right products to appeal to current trends, and making sure they are well-presented to customers in our stores. The success of our model is demonstrated by UK Like-for-Like Revenue Growth in our B&M stores of 23.8% in the financial year 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.2,Investing in new stores,"New stores remain a key driver to our revenue and earnings growth and we have a long growth runway in the UK. As of September 25, 2021 our store portfolio was 993 stores in the UK and 104 stores in a number of regions in France. In the UK, we remain committed to our long-term target to open at least 950 B&M stores from our current base of 686 B&M stores. We believe this to be an increasingly conservative target, given the performance of our UK business in the financial year 2021, particularly if the new customers we have welcomed to our stores in the past year prove to become loyal. In the financial year 2021, we opened a net 25 B&M stores across the UK including a net eight new stores in the South of England. With B&M new store performance continuing to be very strong and the flow of attractive profitable opportunities looking healthy, we expect to open 45 new stores in the financial year 2022. Our Heron Foods store chain also has the potential to become multiple times larger than its present 307 store count. In the financial year 2021, we opened a net 13 Heron Foods stores in the UK and expect to open a similar number of new stores in the financial year 2022. Heron Foods is based predominantly in the north of England, has potential to expand from its heartland to other regions of the UK. Heron Foods operates in the convenience sub-sector of the UK grocery market which is a sub-sector experiencing growth in grocery retailing in the UK. In France, we were primarily focused on re-branding a number of existing stores from the original Babou fascia to the B&M fascia, which we have almost completed with only one store remaining to be re-branded as of the date of this Offering Circular. However, in the financial year 2021 we opened a net three new stores, all under B&M fascia and with layouts and merchandising akin to our B&M stores in the UK, albeit with a category emphasis reflecting the differing needs of the B&M France customer. Given both the size of the French market and the small market share that B&M France currently has in the market, opportunity exists for B&M France to grow its store footprint. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.3,Developing our international business,"Since the disposal of our Jawoll business in March 2020, our only international presence is in France, which has an attractive discount retail channel which has grown in popularity in recent years with a number of other established operators. Our strategy in France is to apply our direct product sourcing and limited assortment SKU model, while refining B&M France’s existing product offering. In particular, our high quality local management team in France has made progress against their two main strategic priorities: firstly, the business has successfully reduced its reliance on Clothing & Apparel while increasing its General Merchandise ranges sourced through the B&M supply chain, which has been well received by our French customers; secondly, the performance of our B&M France stores that have been re-branded from the Babou fascia to the B&M fascia has been encouraging, helping to complement our ongoing range optimization work, as well as improving overall store standards. At the end of the financial year 2021, we had 104 stores in a number of regions in France, all except for one of which are now B&M re-formatted stores. Inevitably, a lengthy period of store closure during the Covid19 lockdown period in France caused certain disruption and set back our plans for the business to some extent. However, the performance of our French business during those periods when our French stores remained open was strong, which we believe suggests that both the changes to the product mix and rebranding are having a positive impact. Subject to the performance of the stores we have re-branded so far, we are aiming to re-brand the remainder of our French estate by the end of 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.4,Investing in our people and infrastructure,"Investing in our people and infrastructure remains a priority. In the UK, during the financial year 2021 we created over 7,200 new jobs across our stores, distribution and support center teams. In addition, we acknowledged the dedication and hard work of our front line colleagues by paying an additional 10% pay in April 2020 and awarding an extra weeks’ wages in January 2021. We have continued to evolve our board of directors and senior management team. In November 2020, we appointed Alex Russo as Group CFO, who brings with him significant experience in the retail sector having worked for a number of leading retailers in the UK and internationally, including Tesco and Asda, and in particular discount retailing experience, having latterly been the CFO of Wilko. We also strengthened the Group senior leadership teams, having welcomed Anthony Giron as Managing Director of our French business in May 2020, Richard Kirk as B&M UK Supply Chain Director in October 2020, Allison Green as Group People Director in February 2020 and Paula MacKenzie as a Non-Executive Director in November 2021. Following Paula MacKenzie’s appointment, female representation at our board level is now 43%, demonstrating the board’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. In addition, we completed and fitted-out our new one million square foot Southern distribution center at Bedford during the financial year 2020, our largest single distribution center building, and it now supplies over one-third of the B&M store estate. We expect the new distribution center to provide sufficient capacity for our expansion plans for the foreseeable future, including enough to meet our 950 UK store target. At store level, our new digital technology Workforce Management System has now been rolled out across all of our stores, having been delayed during the initial Covid-19 outbreak at the start of the financial year 2021. We believe this new system will enable a more agile approach to store rotas, as well as creating efficiencies through the reduction of paper-based processes. Having adopted this new best class approach to managing store hours, we believe it will provide a strong foundation to drive further efficiencies within our store operations and help our business grow sustainably by servicing customer demand in a cost-efficient way. Although store colleague learning and development had to be put on hold at the start of the financial year 2021, the “Step-Up to Managers” program was successfully adapted to facilitate e-learning. A total of 124 colleagues were promoted into management roles this financial year. We continue to invest to ensure that ----- we have appropriate training and processes to attract, retain and incentivize colleagues, as well as continuing to invest in the management team and the central head office functions of each of the businesses of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Recent Developments,9.4.1,Covid-19 Update and the Impact of Brexit,"Since the ongoing global outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, our priorities shifted towards the wellbeing of our colleagues and customers, continuing to serve our customers in a safe working and shopping environment and maintaining the long-term financial health of our business. However, despite significant challenges posed by Covid-19, our business has remained strong and resilient given that we are a value retailer backed by well invested infrastructure and a robust and highly responsive supply chain. The majority of our products are sourced from overseas and, in particular, Asia. Despite normal lead times of 12 to 16 weeks on imported everyday products, and up to nine months on imported seasonal products, our trading teams were able to meet customer demand for products and deliver a strong Like-forLike sales growth of 23.8% in our core B&M UK business due to our business model holding over 12 weeks of “buffer stock” in the UK of general merchandise. We were well-positioned and able to react quickly. At our warehouses, we were able to re-deploy labour and re-prioritize the picking of products experiencing the highest demand at stores to keep them replenished and allow customers to continue to be served daily with what they needed. The majority our sales are within the Grocery, Household & Personal Case, DIY and Hardware categories, and as these goods are designated “essential goods” by the UK Government, we were able to offer them for sale throughout the Covid-19 lockdown. In addition, as of September 25, 2021 approximately 83.5% of our sales are in our “out of town” stores, which we believe allowed customer visits to be safer and more appealing when compared to town center or shopping mall retail due to access by vehicle as opposed to public transport. Although we temporarily closed 49 stores out of 656 stores for approximately three weeks, we were able to keep the majority of stores open throughout the crisis. In France, a further national lockdown began on April 3, 2021 for a total of about 6 weeks, resulting in the closure of many of our French stores, with those remaining open restricted to selling essential items only. However, since restrictions were lifted on May 19, 2021, our French stores’ trading recovered, with sales performance being driven by the success of product ranges sourced from the B&M supplier base in Asia. In addition, we took advantage of the lockdown period to accelerate our conversion program of the Babou fascia, with all of our stores in France except for one now trading as B&M. B&M has managed the impacts of the UK national shortage of HGV drivers through the use of agency drivers to supplement its provision of drivers. Labour shortages have not had any material impact on trading to date. The Group currently has good levels of inventory and in-store availability, having taken receipt of imported goods earlier than normal in direct response to the well-reported supply chain constraints and shipping disruption in both China and the UK. In the first 26 weeks of the financial year 2022, the B&M UK business delivered a strong 2-year like-forlike revenue growth of 16.8% versus pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels. This was driven by strong performance across a range of Grocery and General Merchandise categories, and suggests that a number of the new customers who discovered B&M during the financial year 2021 have been retained. Heron Foods also delivered strong sales performances, with neighbourhood locations performing particularly well as ----- consumers sought to shop locally for their everyday essentials, while B&M France has also traded positively since the most recent Covid-19 lockdown was lifted in France.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

The review concluded that the path to restoring profitability, the creation of a business model capable of delivering acceptable financial returns and the potential for long term growth was likely to entail further substantial investment with an uncertain outcome. As a result, the decision was taken to find a buyer for the business where it could be repositioned back to a clearance outlet model under other ownership. Clearly the experience in Germany was beset with difficulties, but the lessons learned have informed our approach in France so that the execution of our strategy avoids the issues we encountered in Germany.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Prior to November 15, 2024, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes plus a “make-whole” premium as described under “Description of the Notes— _Optional Redemption,” plus accrued and unpaid interest to,_ but excluding, the redemption date. Prior to November 15, 2024, the Issuer may, at its option, and on one or more occasions, redeem up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes) with funds in an equal aggregate amount not exceeding the aggregate net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, at a redemption price equal to 104.000% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, so long as at least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the redemption. Any amount payable in any such redemption may be funded from any source. In connection with any tender for the Notes, if holders of not less than 90% in the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any other person making such tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer will have the right, upon notice given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to such tender offer, to redeem all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to the price offered to each holder in such tender offer, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of the _Notes—Optional Redemption”._ Redemption for Tax Reasons** ...................... If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined in “Description of the Notes”) are announced, enacted or become effective on or after the date of this Offering Circular that would impose withholding taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Notes or any ----- Guarantee, the Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Optional _Redemption for Changes in Withholding Taxes”._ Additional Amounts......................................** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, unless required by law or regulation. If withholding or deduction for such taxes is required to be made with respect to a payment on the Notes or a Guarantee, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or the Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by the holders of the Notes after such withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of such withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts”. Change of Control ........................................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to offer to repurchase all or any part of the outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such repurchase. “Description of the Notes—Change _of Control”._ Certain Covenants ........................................** The Indenture governing the Notes will contain covenants that will, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: - incur additional indebtedness; - create liens; - pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; - enter into agreements that restrict dividends from restricted subsidiaries; - sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; - impair the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; and - effect a consolidation or merger. These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and certain of them will be suspended if and when, and for so long as, the Notes are rated investment grade. For more details see “Description of _the Notes—Certain Covenants”._ ----- Intercreditor Agreement...............................** On July 13, 2020, the Trustee, the Security Agent and certain other parties entered into an intercreditor agreement (the “Intercreditor Agreement”), which governs the relative rights of the obligors and creditors under certain of our existing and future financing arrangements (including the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes, the Notes and certain hedging obligations). Among other things, with respect to such indebtedness, the Intercreditor Agreement regulates its relative priority, the ranking of security interests from which it benefits, the timing of payments, enforcement procedures and release of guarantees and security interests as well as providing for the subordination of certain of our indebtedness and turnover, equalisation and redistribution provisions. For more information, see “Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”._ Use of Proceeds............................................** We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering of the Notes will be approximately £250 million. We expect to use the proceeds of the Offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Offering of the Notes. We may also use the proceeds of the Offering of the Notes and cash on balance sheet to pay a special dividend, which would not exceed the amount of the proceeds of the Offering of the Notes; we have not yet made a decision to pay any such dividend. See “Use of Proceeds”. No Registration Rights.................................** We will not register the Notes under the U.S. federal or state securities laws or under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Transfer Restrictions....................................** The Notes and Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer as described under “Notice to Investors”. Listing ............................................................** Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List of the LuxSE and for the Notes to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. See “Listing _and_ _General _Information”._ There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the LuxSE and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our _Financial Profile and the Notes—The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the LuxSE, and there may not be an active trading market for the Notes, and the trading price of the Notes may be volatile,_ _in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited.”_ Governing Law** .............................................. The Notes and the Indenture governing the Notes will be governed by the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the application of the provisions of article ----- 470-1 to 470-19 (inclusive) of the Luxembourg law on commercial companies dated August 10, 1915, as amended (the “Companies Act 1915”), is expressly excluded. The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law. The Security Documents will be governed by English law and the laws of Luxembourg, where applicable",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

This 14 month approach has been used as it excludes the two month halo period which new stores experience following opening. Halo period refers to the two month period which new stores experience following opening. (2) Gross margin consists of gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Adjusted gross margin consists of gross profit as reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income that has been adjusted to reflect a €7.287 million stock provision that was made relating to B&M France in the financial year 2020 and subsequently released in the financial year 2021. The provision was in relation to discount seasonal stock which was not expected to be sold due to the effect of the French Covid-19 restrictions that were in place from March 15, 2020 until May 11, 2020. (3) EBITDA represents operating profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and excluding the impact of IFRS 16. EBITDA and related measures are not a measurement of performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered by investors in isolation or as a substitute for measures of profit, or as an indicator of the Group’s operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA and related measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, and investors should not use these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for the figures provided in the Financial Statements (incorporated by reference in this Offering Circular). For a reconciliation of EBITDA, see “—EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusting Cost Items” below. (4) EBITDA margin represents EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16) expressed as a percentage of revenue (which excludes VAT). (5) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA (excluding the impact of IFRS 16), as defined above, adjusted to exclude items that we consider to be exceptional or non-trading items, including the effects of derivatives, one off refinancing fees, foreign exchange on the translation of intercompany balances and the effects of revaluing or unwinding balances related to the acquisition of subsidiaries. Significant project costs or gains or losses arising from unusual circumstances or transactions may also be included if incurred. Adjusted EBITDA and related measures are not a measurement of performance or liquidity under IFRS and should not be considered by investors in isolation or as a substitute for measures of profit, or as an indicator of the Group’s operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted EBITDA and related measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, and investors should not use these non-GAAP measures as a substitute for the figures provided in the Financial Statements (incorporated by reference in this Offering Circular).

(6) Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of revenue (which excludes VAT). (7) Interest bearing loans and borrowings reflect the gross amount of cash borrowed at that time, as opposed to the carrying value under the amortized cost method. Lease balances are not included. (8) The Group uses the following definition of net debt: external interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and short-term deposits. (9) The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA for the 26 weeks ended September 26, 2020 and the 26 weeks ended September 25, 2021 is calculated on the basis of net debt and Adjusted EBIDTA for the last twelve months ended September 26, 2020 and September 25, 2021, respectively. 22 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

The profit recognized by the company was £16.9 million with a further £32.1 million gain rolled into the asset value (as required by the IFRS 16 leasing standard) and which will therefore be realized on a straight line basis over the 20 year term of the lease as a reduction in depreciation. A key judgment was made by management to recognize the sale. Under the provisions of IFRS 15, the key requirement over which judgment is applied for a sale to be recognized is that the control of the asset, as defined by the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the asset, has transferred from the Group to the third party. If this is not the case, the transaction should be recognized as financing on the property. Following consideration of the provisions within the lease (including the extension clause and lack of reversionary rights), and the rights and ability of the third party to extract value from the asset they acquired, management believe that the appropriate treatment is to recognize the transaction as a sale, and therefore the whole transaction as a sale and leaseback. Please refer to the Financial Statements (incorporated by reference in this Offering Circular) for more information. 23 ----- (3) The exceptional French stock provision was recognized in the financial year 2020 when the first French lockdown was put into place, resulting in the closure of the French store estate, and there was significant uncertainty regarding when stores would be able to reopen. In the financial year 2020, the balance also included the additional specific losses made by the French segment in those early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic. Ultimately, the stock provision was largely released during the financial year 2021, as the stock was sold through once the stores were reopened and this release has been treated as adjusting to match the financial year 2020 treatment when recognizing the provision. No new adjusting items have been recognized in respect of the Covid-19 pandemic in the financial year 2021. (4) Excluding the effects of IFRS16 on administrative costs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Additionally, a change of control under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement (which includes a different definition of change of control), unless waived by the lenders, would permit any lender under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement to elect to cancel its commitments thereunder and the participation of that lender in all amounts outstanding under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement would become immediately due and payable together with accrued but unpaid interest and all other amounts due to that lender that are accrued and unpaid. Similarly, a change of control under the Existing Indenture would require us to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Existing Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but excluding) the date of repurchase. The source of funds for any repurchase required as a result of any such event would be available cash or cash generated from operating activities or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets, sales of equity or funds provided by our subsidiaries. Sufficient funds may not be available at the time of any such events to make any required repurchases of the Notes tendered and we may not be able to secure access to enough cash to finance the required repurchases of the Notes tendered. Our failure to effect a change of control offer when required would constitute an event of default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events that might adversely affect the value of the Notes (including certain reorganizations, restructurings, mergers or other similar transactions) because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control” as defined in the Indenture.

The definition of “change of control” contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the restricted group taken as whole to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.

In addition, the Issuer and the Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes and the Guarantees by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. However, the Indenture may provide that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law or causing the officers of the Guarantor to incur personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defences and laws, and each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest. These laws and defences include those that relate to corporate benefit and uncommercial transactions, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally.

Other creditors may become parties to the Intercreditor Agreement or we may enter into additional intercreditor agreements in the future. Among other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Security Interests, the sharing in any recoveries from such enforcement and the release of the Collateral by the Security Agent. With respect to the validity and enforceability under Luxembourg law of subordination provisions, Luxembourg counsels are of the view that the Luxembourg courts would, in order to assess the validity and enforceability of contractual subordination provisions, in principle turn to Luxembourg legal doctrine and case law that admit the validity and enforceability of a provision whereby a party agrees to subordinate its claim to that of another creditor, but may not be enforceable against third parties which are not party to the relevant agreement. The treatment of turnover provisions in intercreditor arrangements in Luxembourg law has not been tested before Luxembourg courts. It is possible that a turnover provision (to which a Luxembourg entity is a party) will be characterized as a mere contractual mechanism (unless it takes the form of a Luxembourg security right effective in the insolvency of a junior creditor). Where a junior creditor has been paid in priority over a senior creditor, it is uncertain whether a senior creditor can claw back these amounts in the bankruptcy of a junior creditor. The Notes will be secured by the same Collateral that secures on a pari passu basis our obligations under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and the Existing Notes, and that will secure certain hedging obligations and certain other Indebtedness that we may incur in the future in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent will serve as the Security Agent for secured parties under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Notes and the Notes and hedging arrangements with respect to the shared collateral. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the ----- Security Agent will act with respect to such collateral only at the direction of our senior secured creditors holding a simple majority of the aggregate principal amount of our senior secured debt that is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (including, for this purpose, both drawn and undrawn uncancelled commitments under our Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, debt in respect of certain hedging obligations and debt under the Notes and the Existing Notes). The holders of the Notes will not have separate rights to enforce the collateral. As a result, the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant Security Documents unless the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such holders exceeds 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the total senior secured debt (as calculated above), or before holders of Notes themselves. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes, holders of the Existing Notes and creditors under our Existing Senior Facilities Agreement as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the Collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decision of the instructing group, which may result in enforcement action in respect of the Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders. The creditors under our Existing Senior Facilities Agreement and/or holders of the Existing Notes may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that any proceeds from an enforcement of security which is available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes will be paid pro rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may release certain Collateral in connection with sales of assets pursuant to a permitted disposal or enforcement sale and in other circumstances permitted by the Indenture and the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement. Therefore, such collateral available to secure the Notes could be reduced in connection with the sales of assets or otherwise, subject to the requirements of the financing documents and the Indenture. Certain additional amounts will be available for additional borrowing under the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement by way of incremental facilities (subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions thereunder). In addition, the Indenture governing the Notes, the Existing Indenture and the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement will permit us, in compliance with the covenants in those agreements, to incur significant additional indebtedness secured by liens on the Collateral. Our ability to incur additional debt in the future secured on the Collateral may have the effect of diluting the ratio of the value of such Collateral to the aggregate amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. As a result, holders of Notes may receive less than holders of other secured indebtedness. The granting of a shared security interest to secure future indebtedness may restart or reopen hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period may run from the moment such new security is amended, granted or perfected. If the security interest granted were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

See “Description of the Notes—Security”. Not all of our assets secure the Notes, and the Indenture allows the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to secure any future senior secured indebtedness (as defined in the Indenture) permitted to be incurred under the Indenture (which may be structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees) with the property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Notes. The value of such assets and property could be significant. If there is an event of default and to the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the Collateral securing the Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes and the Guarantees. While the Indenture creates certain obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, or a particular class of assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries, the designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as a restricted subsidiary or otherwise, such obligations are subject to certain agreed security principles. The agreed security principles set forth in the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement set out a number of limitations on the rights of the holders of the Notes to be granted security in certain circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed security principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

If we default on the Notes, holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets underlying the security interests granted in favour of holders of the Notes. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral on the issue of the Notes or subsequently will be sufficient to enable the Issuer to perform its obligations under the Notes. There is no requirement to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient. In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or the Guarantors in connection with the issue of the Notes. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the jurisdiction in which the enforcement action or sale is completed, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of its assets in the event of an enforcement action. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security ----- interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes or the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Collateral could be sold in a timely manner, if at all. For instance, the shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares and inter-company loan receivables may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. The Indenture also allows incurrence of certain additional permitted debt in the future that is secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and the definition of Permanent Collateral Liens as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”. The incurrence of any additional debt secured by the Collateral would reduce amounts payable to investors from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral. The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the availability of buyers and other factors. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of an enforcement of the liens in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes. To the extent that other first priority security interests, pre-existing liens, liens permitted under the Indenture and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, those parties may have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that could adversely affect the value of the security and the ability of the security trustee to realize or foreclose on the security. The Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favour of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes offered hereby, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such security. Furthermore, the first-priority security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under English law. The security interests of the Security Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents or that such consents will be given when required. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon security and the value of the security may significantly decrease. ----- Certain of our material contracts terminate or may be terminated by the counterparties thereto upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events. If we, the holders of the Notes, the Trustee or any other party causes such an insolvency event, we would lose our rights under those contracts, which represent a material percentage of our expected turnover and a substantial portion of our property portfolio.

The liens on the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Guarantees if we or the Security Agent are not able to or do not take the actions necessary to perfect any such liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favour of the Notes and the Guarantees against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent will have an obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or take any action in relation to the perfection of any security interest therein. Additionally, the Indenture and the Security Documents entered into in connection with the Notes will not require us to take actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Security Agent in the Collateral. To the extent that the security interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding. The granting of security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may be subject to hardening periods for such security interests. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run as from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated, depending on the applicable laws. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void, it may be deemed ineffective towards the bankruptcy estate and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

Thereafter, these payments are credited to participants’ accounts that hold Book-Entry interests in the global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer, as applicable, has no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of Book-Entry interests.

Unless the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under the caption “— _Optional Redemption”, the Issuer will, not later than 30 days following the date the Issuer obtains actual_ knowledge of any Change of Control having occurred, mail a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date); (2) the purchase date (which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed except that such notice may be delivered more than 60 days prior to the purchase date if such purchase date is delayed as provided in clause (4) of this paragraph); (3) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (4) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, that such offer is conditioned on the occurrence of such Change of Control and that the purchase date may, in the Issuer’s discretion be delayed until such time as the Change of Control has occurred. ----- No Note will be repurchased in part if less than £100,000 in original principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable laws or regulations, including securities laws, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer has no present plans to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The occurrence of certain of the events that would constitute a Change of Control would require prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Agreements governing Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control. Agreements governing future Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may prohibit the Issuer from repurchasing the Notes upon a Change of Control or restrict the ability of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries to provide funds to the Issuer necessary to enable it to repurchase the Notes. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require repayment of Indebtedness under, such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. As described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption”, the Issuer also has the right to redeem the Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control or otherwise. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes. The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale or other transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Although there is a developing body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the holders of the Notes have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Notes. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any Change of Control Offer on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.bourse.lu) (the information contained on that website is not part of this Offering Circular). -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Board of Directors may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such covenant would have been in effect during such period. If on any subsequent date, in case of a suspension of the foregoing covenants pursuant to (a) of the first paragraph above, one or both of the Rating Agencies downgrade the ratings assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, the foregoing covenants will be reinstated as of and from the time at which the Issuer obtains actual knowledge of such rating decline (any such date, a “Reversion Date”). The period of time between the suspension of covenants as set forth above and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified, at the Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or one or more of the clauses set for in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to the Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Period and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been Incurred under the exception provided by clause (b)(iii) of “—Certain Covenants— _Limitation on Indebtedness”. With respect to Restricted Payments made after any such reinstatement, the_ amount of Restricted Payments will be calculated as if the covenant described under the caption “—Certain _Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension_ Period. For purposes of the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”, upon the occurrence of a Reversion Date the amount of Excess_ Proceeds not applied in accordance with such covenant will be deemed to be reset to zero. In addition, for purposes of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from _Restricted Subsidiaries”, all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion_ Time that contain any of the encumbrances or restrictions subject to such covenant will be deemed to have been existing on the Issue Date. During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definitions of “Permitted Liens” and “Unrestricted Subsidiary” to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant were in effect during the Suspension Period. ----- Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred for any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension Period. The Issuer and any Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or breach of any kind under the Indenture, to honour, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations entered into during a Suspension Period following a Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.

(c) The Issuer will, not later than 45 days after the Issuer becomes obligated to make an Asset Offer pursuant to this covenant (it being understood that the Issuer may satisfy its obligations pursuant to this covenant by making an Asset Offer with respect to all or part of the Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture), mail a notice to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent stating (1) that an Asset ----- Disposition that requires the purchase of a portion of the Notes has occurred and that such Holder has the right (subject to the prorating described below) to require the Issuer to repurchase a portion of such Holder’s Notes in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant Interest Payment Date); (2) the repayment date (which will be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed); (3) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased; and (4) the amount of the Asset Offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a declaration of acceleration in respect of the Notes because an Event of Default specified in clause (v) above shall have occurred and be continuing, such declaration of acceleration of the Notes and such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (including any acceleration or resulting payment default) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, and be of no further effect, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose (x) the Indebtedness that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged, or (y) the holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice, action or other event or condition (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default, or (z) the default in respect of such Indebtedness that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and if so requested by the Trustee, have provided to the Trustee indemnity and/or ----- security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due against the Issuer or any Guarantor, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will be given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any) or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. In addition, the Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signer thereof knows of any Default that is continuing that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer will also be required to deliver to the Trustee, promptly, and in any event within 30 days, after becoming aware of the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain Events of Default, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

DAC 6 requires intermediaries and, in some cases, taxpayers to report certain cross border arrangements to the competent authorities in relevant EU member state(s), and the reported information may be automatically exchanged among the competent authorities of all other EU member states. A reportable cross border arrangement must involve at least one EU member state and meet one or more hallmarks which can be either “generic” or “specific” hallmarks. From January 1, 2021, all “reportable arrangements” must be reported within 30 days as from when the transaction is available, ready, or implemented (whichever is sooner). Following the adoption of the Luxembourg law of 25 March 2020 implementing DAC 6 in Luxembourg, certain intermediaries and, in certain cases, taxpayers will have to report to the Luxembourg tax authorities within a specific timeframe certain information on reportable cross-border arrangements. Failure to comply with the scope of the reporting obligations laid down by DAC 6 can, under Luxembourg law, result in penalties up to EUR 250,000. Other penalties apply under the national laws of other EU member states transposing DAC 6. Non-exhaustive possible causes of failure to comply include nonreporting, late, inaccurate or incomplete reporting, and failure of lawyers to timely notify intermediaries or taxpayers of the obligation to report (where lawyers are prevented from disclosing information to a competent authority themselves under a duty of professional confidentiality). Although DAC 6 no longer has direct effect in the United Kingdom following the end of the post-Brexit transitional period, an amended version of the UK legislation that originally transposed DAC 6 remains in effect: it provides for a mandatory disclosure regime that is similar to DAC 6 in many respects, with the notable exception that all of the hallmarks other than those relating to obscuring beneficial ownership and undermining reporting obligations under laws implementing the automatic exchange of financial information (including FATCA and CRS) have been disapplied (such regime, “MDR”). Each Investor should consult its own tax adviser regarding the application of DAC 6 or MDR to a purchase of the Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

It is based upon UK tax law as applied in England and published H.M. Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) practice as of the date of this Offering Circular. Such laws may be repealed, revoked or modified and such practice may not bind HMRC and/or may change, so as to result in UK tax consequences different from those discussed below. Except where noted, the discussion relates only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes, which hold the Notes as investments (and, therefore, do not hold the Notes in connection with any trade) and may not apply to persons in special situations, such as financial institutions, investment funds, trustees and persons who are or become connected with the Issuer other than through their holding of the Notes. The discussion does not constitute legal or tax advice and, accordingly, persons considering the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes should consult their own tax advisers concerning the UK tax consequences in the light of their particular situations as well as any consequences arising under the law of any other relevant tax jurisdiction. No representations with respect to the UK tax consequences of any particular holder of Notes are made in this section. This summary does not purport to describe all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a prospective holder of the Notes.

In addition, a substantial proportion of the Group’s activities, along with a commensurate proportion of its profits, are generated in the UK. These factors may result in the Notes being regarded as having a UK source for UK tax purposes and, as such, may be subject to UK income tax by direct assessment even where paid without withholding. In the event that interest on the Notes is regarded as having a UK source, such interest will generally be paid after deduction of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%.). However, no withholding or deduction of UK income tax at source will be required from payments of interest where: - the Notes are listed on a “recognized stock exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Euro MTF Market of the LuxSE being such a recognized stock exchange for these purposes) or admitted to trading on a multilateral trading facility operated by an EEAregulated recognized stock exchange; or - the Issuer reasonably believes that the person beneficially entitled to such interest is: a) a company resident in the UK; or b) a company not resident in the UK which carries on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment and which is required to bring into account the interest in computing its UK taxable profits; or c) a partnership each member of which is a company referred to in (a) or (b) above or a combination of companies referred to in (a) and (b) above, and (in any such case) HMRC has not given a direction that the interest should be paid under deduction of tax.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017), (the “Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “center of main interests” (“COMI”) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties” and that in the case of a company or legal person, COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, though that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. This means that a company’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the determination of where a company has its COMI is depends on the facts and circumstances as at the date the company enters an insolvency proceeding and on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State (in which the debtor’s COMI is situated) which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g., the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to ----- the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets).",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. An establishment is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to mean, any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated because of the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings.

The EUWA (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly applicable EU law (which ----- includes regulations) as it stood at the end of the transition period into UK domestic law. However, whilst direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law of the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) sets out a number of amendments to be made to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as it will apply in the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period. On December 30, 2020 the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”), which entered into force at 11:00 pm (UK time) on April 30, 2021. There remains considerable political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and the extent to which Brexit could adversely affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU. The Cooperation Agreement does not include a replacement for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state. For instance, if a UK company has its COMI in a Member State, the Member State court will be bound by the Recast Insolvency Regulation and may take jurisdiction based on COMI if a creditor applies for a proceeding there or if the company applies for recognition of an English insolvency proceeding. EU insolvency proceedings and judgments may still be recognized under the Cross Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “CBIR”) which implements the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency (the “UNCITRAL Model Law”). The CBIR provide that if certain criteria are satisfied, an English court must recognize foreign insolvency proceedings. The criteria include (a) that the debtor is subject to foreign proceedings, as defined in Schedule 1 of CBIR; and (b) that an application is made by the representative appointed in respect of those foreign proceedings. For ‘foreign main proceedings’ (i.e., where the debtor company has its center of main interests in such foreign jurisdiction), a stay in respect of certain actions will automatically come into force on recognition. For ‘foreign non-main proceedings’ (i.e., where the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has an ‘establishment’ but not its COMI—establishment being any place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services), there is no automatic stay but the English court can grant discretionary relief with the same effect. The Insolvency Act also requires the English courts to provide assistance to the courts of certain other “relevant territories” having parallel jurisdiction in relation to insolvency law. The courts have held that the purpose of this legislation, which is broadly drafted, is to prevent a foreign insolvency officer or a debtor’s creditors from needing to open separate proceedings in England and Wales and to give them the remedies that they would have been entitled to if the equivalent proceedings had been opened there. Apart from the statutory regimes, there is a broad remit for the English courts to provide assistance under the common law to a foreign court or insolvency officer, where requested to do so by such foreign court or insolvency officer. Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast) (the “Judgments Regulation”) will continue to apply where the UK or foreign court was informed of proceedings before December 31, 2020. For proceedings commenced after December 31, 2020 the Judgments Regulation will not apply meaning that the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments in Member States from January 1, 2021 has ended. This is particularly relevant in respect of schemes of arrangement where, if the scheme involved a scheme creditor domiciled outside of the U.K. in another Member State, scheme companies have historically pointed to the Judgments Regulation as one potential basis for recognition of an English scheme throughout the EU. In respect of alternative bases of recognition, there are a number of potential options. The UK applied to join the Lugano Convention on April 8, 2020, which would allow the UK and the Member States to retain the benefits of mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments. Accession to the Lugano Convention requires agreement of all other contracting parties and Denmark and the Member States are yet to indicate their ----- agreement. The Rome I Regulation continues to apply post January 1, 2021 (subject to amendments) in respect of contracts and finance documents governed by English law. This may provide a basis for recognition for schemes and restructuring plans in respect of English law documents throughout the EU, subject to the approach taken by each Member State. Scheme / restructuring plan companies may also otherwise continue to look to the principles of international private law for a basis of recognition, which will need to be approached on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the English Obligors would likely, but may not necessarily, be based on English insolvency law. However, as discussed in the “—European _Union” section above, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, and, where a company incorporated_ under English law has its COMI in a Member State of the European Union (other than Denmark), any main insolvency proceedings for that company could, subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the Member State in which its COMI is located and be, subject to certain exceptions set out in Articles 8 to 18 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, subject to the laws of that Member State. Similarly, the CBIR, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law in England and Wales, provide that a foreign court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its COMI in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). English insolvency law is different from the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including: by the company or its directors or a creditor making an application for administration in court; or by the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” filing for administration out of court; or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company (noting that there are some temporary COVID-19 related restrictions in place on such filings as introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA”)) or the company resolving to do so (in the case of liquidation). A company may be wound up if it is unable to pay its debts, and may be placed into administration if it is, or is likely, to become unable to pay its debts, and the administration is reasonably likely to achieve one of three statutory objectives. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the English Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the English Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the English Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of any English Obligor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. An administrator can also be appointed (subject to specific conditions) out of court by a company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointer. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the Company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the Company’s creditors as a whole than if the Company went into liquidation (without first being in administration) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. During the administration, in general, creditors cannot exercise their rights against a company, such that, among other things, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued against such company, or security enforced over such company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. This moratorium does not, however, apply to a “security financial collateral arrangement” (such as a charge over cash or financial instruments such as ----- shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations. During the administration of a company, a creditor would not be able to enforce any security interest (other than a valid security financial collateral arrangement) or guarantee granted by the company (although a demand for payment could be made under such guarantee) without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. In addition, a secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver while an administrator is in office although, in certain circumstances (principally where one of the exceptions to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver applies as set out in the Insolvency Act, or pursuant to a debenture dated earlier than September 15, 2003), the holder of a floating charge can block the appointment of an administrator where it can appoint an administrative receiver. In order to empower the Security Agent to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator to the company out of court, the floating charge granted by the relevant Obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating charge” for the purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions in the Insolvency Act as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. The Security Agent will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of security, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant Obligor and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant Obligor during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is invalid. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. A moratorium is also available pursuant to Part A1 to the Insolvency Act (inserted by CIGA, which came into force on June 26, 2020) for certain “eligible companies, which can be for a period of up to 20 business days, extendable for a further period of 20 business days (without creditor consent) or up to a total period of one year with creditor consent or longer if the court so orders (although the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may, by order, extend or reduce the duration of any such period). An eligible company includes, amongst other legal entities, a company registered under the Companies Act 2006 (the “CA06”) (but excludes certain financial services firms). A company is, however, not eligible if on the filing date it is party to an agreement which is or forms part of a “capital markets arrangement” under which a party has incurred or was expected to incur a debt of at least £10.0 million (at any time during the life of the arrangement) and which involves the issue of a capital markets investment. The definitions of “capital market arrangement” and “capital market investment” are broad and are such that, in general terms, any company which is a party to an arrangement which involves at least £10 million of debt, the granting of security to a trustee, and the issue of a rated, listed or traded debt instrument, is excluded from being eligible for a moratorium. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is a “eligible company” may also change from time to time. Although the English Guarantors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets exclusion, if the moratorium were to apply to any of the English Guarantors, its effects would include prohibitions on enforcement of security that are similar to those that arise upon an administration moratorium. Therefore, to the extent the Part A1 moratorium applies, there would be a moratorium on legal ----- proceedings and execution or other legal process being commenced or continued and the levy of distress against the company or its property (except with the permission of the court). No other steps may be taken to enforce any security over the company’s property except with the permission of the court. The company may dispose of charged property if the holder of the security consents or the court gives permission. Although the directors remain in full control of the relevant company during the moratorium, the company’s activities are subject to oversight by an appointed official called a “monitor.” During the moratorium period, the company cannot pay pre-moratorium debts that are subject to a payment holiday unless the monitor consents, the payment is court-sanctioned or ordered, or the maximum total amount paid to a person does not exceed the greater of £5,000 or 1% of the company’s total unsecured debts at the start of the moratorium.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Failing this, the security created by the security document will (subject as mentioned in the above Chapter) be void against a liquidator or administrator and any creditor of the charging company. The application of the above Chapter to a security interest is subject to the application of the Financial Collateral Arrangements Regulations. Under the above Chapter, when security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21 day registration period has expired. In addition, the following categories of charge are not registrable under the above Chapter (as set out in section 859A(6) of the CA06): (a) a charge in favour of a landlord on a cash deposit given as a security in connection with the lease of land; (b) a charge created by a member of Lloyd’s (within the meaning of the Lloyd’s Act 1982) to secure its obligations in connection with its underwriting business at Lloyd’s; and (c) a charge excluded from the application of section 859A of the CA06 by or under any other Act (such as charges that are exempted from registration under the Banking Act 2009). Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. Registration may also determine the order of priority of registrable security interests and may provide notice of a pre-existing security interest for the purpose of priorities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

In addition, the granting of upstream (or cross-stream) guarantees or security by an English company could be subject to challenge if it results in a reduction in that company’s net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the extent that it does, the company does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the CA06 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the CA06 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the English courts have held that it takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable”.

At the end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved. A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of a company to which they are appointed; to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up; to sell the company’s property and execute documents in the name of the company; and to challenge antecedent transactions. In the case of a liquidation commenced by way of a court order, no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against the company except with leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose (although security enforcement is not affected). In proceedings where the company or its directors have resolved to place the company into liquidation, the liquidator (or creditor or shareholder) can apply to the court for an order that no proceedings or other actions may be commenced or continued against the company. There is no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding up. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. Onerous property, for these purposes, is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous, or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power does not apply to a contract all the obligations under which have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up. One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the insolvent company and to distribute the realizations made from those assets to its creditors. Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules (England and Wales) 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined and described below), distributions cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority of claims on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): ----- _First ranking claims: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific_ assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor, but only to the extent of the realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest; _Second ranking claims: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the_ order of priority in which expenses are paid); _Third ranking claims: first, ordinary preferential debts, being contributions to occupational pension_ schemes, employment claims (wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person and holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date) and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit; and secondly, secondary preferential debts, being bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims exceed the statutory limit. The UK government has confirmed its intention in the Finance Bill 2020 that from 1 December 2020 secondary preferential debts will include claims by HMRC in respect of taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; _Fourth ranking claims: holders of any floating charge security, according to the priority of their security._ However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part must be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; _Fifth ranking claims: firstly, (a) provable debts of unsecured creditors and secured creditors to the extent_ of any unsecured shortfall (these rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them); secondly, (b) statutory interest that arises on debts after the insolvency at either the contractual or a statutory rate; and finally (c) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. To pay a shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part in respect of a shortfall unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; and _Sixth ranking claims: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining_ funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors will be ranked according to the terms of the subordination. An administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of any floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (the “Prescribed Part”). This applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the relevant company’s net property subject to floating charges, and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000. The Prescribed Part will not apply if cost of making a distribution to unsecured creditors would be disproportionate to the benefits. Where the company’s net property is worth less than £10,000 the administrator, receiver (including administrative receiver) or liquidator the company has the power to decide unilaterally whether the cost would be disproportionate to the benefit. Where the company’s net property is with more than £10,000 a court order is needed in order to disapply the Prescribed Part on this basis. The Prescribed Part also does not apply where certain types of insolvency arrangements (such as a scheme of arrangement) are implemented. The Prescribed Part can also be disapplied by a company voluntary arrangement or a compromise or arrangement agreed under Part 26 or 26A of the CA06 (described in further detail below). In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, legislation was introduced to restrict temporarily the ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. With effect from 1 October 2021, those restrictions expired and were replaced by new more limited regulations introducing temporary targeted ----- measures to limit the use of winding-up petitions in certain circumstances but not prevent their general use. These temporary measures: (a) raise the threshold upon which a winding-up petition may be presented from £750 to £10,000; (b) allow a creditor to present a winding-up petition only after expiry of a 21 day period during which the debtor has failed to provide a proposal for repayment satisfactory to the creditor; and (c) prevent landlords petitioning to wind-up tenants for unpaid rent arrears arising as a result of Covid-19.

The grant of a security interest or guarantee will only be a transaction at an undervalue if the transaction constitutes a gift or is made on terms that provide that the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less value, in money or in money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company and the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in section 123 of the Insolvency Act). For a challenge to be made, the guarantee or security must be granted within a period of two years ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act). A court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit the company. Subject to this, if the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside any security interests granted or guarantees although there is protection for a third party that benefits from the transaction and has acted in good faith and for value).

The grant of a security interest or guarantee is a preference if it has the effect of placing a creditor (or a surety or guarantor of the company) in a better position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation than if the security interest or guarantee had not been granted. For a challenge to be made, the preference must occur within the period of six months ending with the onset of insolvency (as defined in section 240 of the Insolvency Act) if the beneficiary of the preference is not a connected person or two years if the beneficiary is a connected person. In addition, the company must have been “unable to pay its debts” at the time it gave the preference or become “unable to pay its debts” as a result. A company’s “inability to pay its debts” in this scenario has the same meaning as in the case of a transaction at an undervalue save that, in the case of a preference, there is no presumption of insolvency if the parties are connected. A court will not make an order in respect of a preference of a person unless it is satisfied that the company in deciding to give the preference was influenced by a desire to put that person in a better position. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given (which could include reducing payments under the guarantees or setting aside the security interests or guarantees). An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not he is the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value, or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when he was a creditor of the company. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was unable to pay its debts and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such influence. The company’s administrator or liquidator also has the power to assign the claim challenging such transaction to a third party.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

A transaction will constitute a transaction defrauding creditors if it is a transaction at an undervalue (as outlined above) and the court is satisfied the substantial purpose of a party to the transaction was to put assets beyond the reach of actual or potential claimants against it or to prejudice the interest of such persons. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, then it may make such order as it may deem fit to restore the position to what it was prior to the transaction or protect the victims of the transaction (including reducing payments under the guarantee or setting aside the security interest or guarantees). However, such an order: (a) cannot prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant ----- circumstances; and (b) cannot require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, to pay any sum unless such person was a party to the transaction. Any “victim” of the transaction (with the permission of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) may apply to court under this provision and not just liquidators or administrators.

Both processes can be used by a company for debt adjustment or reorganization. The Part 26 scheme of arrangement is technically not an insolvency procedure, but the Part 26A restructuring plan, for which it is a requirement that the company be suffering from financial difficulties that are affecting or will or may affect its ability to carry on business as a going concern, is an insolvency proceeding. In addition, a foreign Guarantor which is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and has a “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction could also pursue a Part 26 scheme or a Part 26A restructuring plan. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed, or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a Part 26 scheme of arrangement or Part 26A restructuring plan at a hearing where the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme or restructuring plan will be ----- considered, affected creditors (and potentially members) will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors and members that will be affected by the proposed scheme or restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme or restructuring plan. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors, although creditor proposals are in practice extremely rare. In the case of a Part 26 scheme, if a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of the those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. In the case of a Part 26A restructuring plan, each class is deemed to approve the plan if 75% or more by value of that class vote in favor. However, unlike a Part 26 scheme, dissenting classes that do not meet this threshold can be bound by a Part 26A restructuring plan if (a) the court is satisfied that no dissenting class is worse off than in the “relevant alternative” (i.e., the most likely outcome if the Part 26A restructuring plan is not sanctioned by the court) and (b) the Part 26A restructuring plan has been approved by 75% or more by value of at least one class of creditors/members that would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the “relevant alternative” referred to above. The Part 26 scheme or Part 26A restructuring plan, as relevant, then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the Part 26 scheme or Part 26A restructuring plan and consider whether it should be sanctioned. The court has the discretion as to whether to sanction the Part 26 scheme or Part 26A restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the Part 26 scheme or Part 26A restructuring plan. Unlike an administration proceeding, a Part 26 scheme and Part 26A restructuring plan does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. However, under the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 the courts of England and Wales have the discretionary power to stay proceedings against a debtor company on the grounds that the debtor company is attempting to implement a Part 26 or Part 26A restructuring plan and there is a reasonable prospect that the restructuring plan will go ahead.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

According to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the place of the registered office of a company shall be presumed to be the COMI in the absence of proof to the contrary. As a result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the COMI of each Luxembourg Obligor is located in Luxembourg and consequently that the Commercial Court would have jurisdiction to open “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the Recast Insolvency Regulation), such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg law. However, the localisation of the COMI (including the COMI of a Luxembourg Obligor) is a question of fact, which may change from time to time. Preamble 28 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is ascertainable by third parties.” ----- Accordingly, the following types of proceedings (together, “insolvency proceedings”) may be opened against an entity having its registered office or center of principal interests in Luxembourg: - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Luxembourg company itself, by any of its creditors or ex officio by the Commercial Court. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) cumulatively has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). Bankruptcy proceedings are primarily designed to realize the assets of the bankrupt entity in order to pay off its debts. One of the main effects of such proceedings is the stay of proceedings: unsecured creditors and creditors with a general priority right would, as of the bankruptcy order, no longer be permitted to take any action based on title to movable and immovable assets, nor any enforcement action against a Luxembourg Obligor’s movable or immovable assets. However, secured creditors who are holding Security Interests falling within the scope of the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Luxembourg **Collateral** **Law”),** may enforce their security regardless of the bankruptcy adjudication; - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée) which are governed by a grand-ducal decree of May 24, 1935 (the “Decree”), are available to a Luxembourg Obligor, in the event that it no longer has creditworthiness or is experiencing difficulties in meeting all of its commitments. The purpose of controlled management proceedings is to assist a Luxembourg Obligor in reorganizing its business or in optimising the sale of its assets under the supervision of the Commercial Court and of court-appointed commissioners and with the approval of the creditors. The opening of such proceedings may only be requested by the management of a Luxembourg Obligor and not by its creditors. The Commercial Court first examines the request (and the evidence) filed by the applicant to determine whether a controlled management order is justified. If the application is not dismissed, the Commercial Court appoints one of its judges to prepare a report on the financial situation of the applicant’s business. The court order does not prevent creditors from commencing or continuing court proceedings against the applicant, but the creditors are, as of that date, not permitted to enforce any court judgments against the applicant. Security interests falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Law will, however, be enforceable notwithstanding the controlled management proceedings. As of the same judgment, a Luxembourg Obligor may not, without the written approval of the appointed judge, dispose of its assets, grant pledges or mortgages, make commitments or payments, enter into settlement agreements, borrow money or receive funds. Once the report has been finalized, the Commercial Court decides whether the application for controlled management will be granted or rejected. If the application is granted, one or more commissioners will be appointed by the Commercial Court to prepare a reorganization or liquidation plan. A Luxembourg Obligor may not, without the commissioners’ prior approval, and under penalty of nullity of such acts, alienate any of its assets, grant pledges or mortgages, borrow or receive any amounts of money, enter into settlement agreements, or perform any management activity including making any commitments under any agreement, without the formal authorization of the commissioners. The commissioners may impose measures to preserve either the company’s interests or those of the creditors and challenge (voidance actions or claw-back actions) transactions and payments made in violation of the creditor’s rights and in violation of the Decree. The reorganization or liquidation plan must be accepted by a majority (in number and value) of creditors to become binding; - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the obtaining of which is requested by a Luxembourg Obligor only after having received a prior consent from a majority of its creditors holding 75% at least of the claims against a Luxembourg Obligor. The obtaining of such composition proceedings will trigger a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors, subject to the exceptions under the Luxembourg Collateral Law; - stay on payments (sursis de paiements) or putting the company into judicial liquidation (liquidation _judiciaire); and_ - judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in violation of the commercial ----- code or of the laws governing commercial companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings. The Issuer’s liability in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the Issuer following, in particular, bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those of the Issuer’s debts that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. For example, preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue (Administration des Contributions Directes); - value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise (Administration de l’Enregistrement, des Domaines et de la TVA); - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive. Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized and subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law.). In particular, pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, all collateral arrangements, in respect of assets over which the Luxembourg security interests have been granted, as well as all enforcement events and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings.

In particular: ----- - article 445 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code sets out that specific transactions entered into during the hardening period and an additional period of ten days preceding the hardening period fixed by the Commercial Court are null and void (including the disposals by a Luxembourg Obligor of movable and immovable assets without consideration or with inadequate consideration; payments whether in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means for non-matured debts; payments that have not been in cash or by way of negotiable and non-negotiable papers for matured debts and the granting of security interests for antecedent debts); - article 446 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code provides that the bankruptcy receiver may challenge and initiate nullity actions in the following events: (i) payments made for matured debts (dettes échues); and (ii) other transactions realized during the hardening period, if the contracting party had knowledge of the cessation of payments; and - regardless of the hardening period, article 448 of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (actio pauliana) give the court-appointed bankruptcy receiver or the creditor the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the bankruptcy, without limitation of time.

The granting of security rights over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be subject to validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render such security interests invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to formalities (including judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be time-consuming in the event that the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or guarantee. Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions. According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei _sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is_ situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities held with a depository in Luxembourg, etc. ----- If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge agreement must be (i) notified to or acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the security interest) and (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge over receivables becomes enforceable against the debtor of the receivables and third parties from the moment when the agreement pursuant to which the pledge was created is entered into between the pledgor and the pledgee. However, if the debtor has not been notified of the pledge or if he did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, he will be validly discharged if he pays the pledgor. In addition, the account bank has to waive any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, the creation and perfection of such pledge will require additional acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such registrations, notifications and acceptances occur, the pledge agreements are not effective and perfected against the debtors, the account banks and other third parties. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets out enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited to: - direct appropriation or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets, if applicable; - sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially reasonable terms (conditions _commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public auction;_ - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, for example, courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/ arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, in particular where a Luxembourg Obligor becomes subject to Luxembourg Insolvency Proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the Recast Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the Recast Insolvency Regulation (as applicable) applies, and in accordance with article 5 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of ----- secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes, in particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party that are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with the claims of all of the other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,893,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GUARANTEES AND SECURITY AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,893.4,Luxembourg,893.4.7,Limitation on Guarantee and Security Interest,"The granting of guarantees/security interests by a Luxembourg company is subject to specific limitations and requirements relating to corporate object and corporate interest. The granting of guarantees/security interests by a company incorporated and existing in Luxembourg must not be prohibited by the corporate object (objet social) and/or legal form of that company. In addition, there is also a requirement according to which the granting of security by a company has to be for its “corporate interest.” The Companies Act 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. It is generally held that, within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity should, to a certain extent, be tempered by, and subordinated to, the interest of the group. A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion with the real financial means of the assisting company or have a reciprocal character. A company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate object and is in the best interest of the company. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit. The provision of a guarantee/security interest for the obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the provision of cross-stream and upstream guarantees/security interests may be more problematic. Failure to comply with the above mentioned corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability for the managers of the Luxembourg company concerned. The question whether a guarantee granted in the absence of corporate interest could be held null and void is discussed among legal doctrine. While some authors express the view that an absence of corporate interest could give rise to liability of the directors of the relevant company only, others consider that the consequences could be that the relevant obligations be null and void. ----- There is a risk that the managers of a Luxembourg company will be held liable if, among other things: - the guarantee/security interest so provided would materially exceed the (direct or indirect) benefit deriving from the secured obligations for the Luxembourg company; or - the Luxembourg company derives no personal benefit or obtains no direct or indirect consideration for the guarantee/security interest granted; or - the commitment of the Luxembourg company exceeds its financial means. In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the managers of the Luxembourg company, a guarantee provided by a Luxembourg company could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public) (in case of facts consisting a misuse of corporate assets). The above analysis is slightly different within a group of companies where a group interest (intérêt de _groupe) exists. The existence of a group interest could prevent a guarantee provided by a Luxembourg_ company from falling foul of the above constraints. In order for a group interest to be recognized, the following cumulative criteria must be met and proven: - the “assisting” company must receive some benefit, or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the affiliates; - the financial assistance must not exceed the assisting company’s financial means, in which case it is typical for the guarantee to be limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds (capitaux propres); and - the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective. As a result, the guarantees/security interests granted by a Luxembourg company may be subject to certain limitations, which usually take the form of a general limitation language, which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s) and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg assisting company under all finance documents. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company might incur criminal penalties based on the concept of misappropriation of corporate assets (article 1500-11 of the Companies Act 1915). The guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company could themselves be held void or unenforceable if their granting is contrary to Luxembourg public policy (ordre public). As a result of the above developments, the up-stream and cross-stream guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company will be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of general limitation language for Luxembourg guarantors (limiting the guarantee obligations of such Luxembourg company to a certain percentage of, inter alia, its net assets (capitaux propres)), which is inserted in the relevant finance document(s), indentures or guarantee agreements and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg company under all finance documents, indentures or guarantee agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions.

Under the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and Guarantors have agreed that: - during a period of 90 days from the date hereof (if the sale of the Securities by the Issuer and the Guarantors to the Initial Purchasers shall have occurred), the Issuer will not, and will not allow its subsidiaries or Affiliates over which it exercises management or voting control, or any other person acting on its behalf, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, to sell, offer to sell, contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of any other securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially identical to the Securities or that are convertible or exchangeable into securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially identical to the Securities; and - the Issuers and the Guarantors will indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes at the offering price that appears on the cover page of this Offering Circular. After the initial offerings, the Initial Purchasers may change the offering price and any other selling terms. Depending on market conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own accounts. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates or through registered broker dealers. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to Investors”.

66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.1,England,145.1.1,,"The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England is based upon advice provided to us by our English counsel, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. A judgment obtained in the courts of New York in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with the Notes would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in England because there is no treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (as opposed to arbitration awards). Such a judgment may, however, be enforced in England by way of a separate action initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England for the sum payable on the judgment and, subject to what is described below, the English court would not generally re-examine the merits and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English rules on private international law; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other changes of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that an English court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. An English court may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfied the court that: - the U.S. judgment was obtained by fraud; - the U.S. judgment contravenes English public policy; ----- - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in a U.S. court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit); - the U.S. judgment was obtained in breach of English principles of natural or substantial justice; - the U.S. judgment is (i) a judgment on a matter previously determined by an English court; (ii) another court whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England; or (iii) a judgment which conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; and - the English enforcement proceedings were not instituted within the relevant limitation period. Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce in England judgments that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, we cannot assure you whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. It may not be possible to obtain an English judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Also note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2021,193
66_2,Final Offerings 2021.md,145,ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,145.2,Luxembourg,145.2.1,,"We have been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws, would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favourable judgment in a U.S. court may initiate enforcement proceedings in Luxembourg (exequatur) by requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment rendered in civil or commercial matters by the Luxembourg District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) subject to compliance with the relevant provisions of the New Luxembourg Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code _de Procédure Civile) and Luxembourg case law, being:_ - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has personal and subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter according to its applicable laws and Luxembourg private international law rules on conflict of jurisdiction and the choice of venue was proper; - the judgment rendered by the U.S. court is enforceable (exécutoire) in the U.S.; - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by Luxembourg courts or, at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules (based on case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court); - the judgment must have been granted in compliance with the rights of the defendant to appear, and if the defendant appeared, to present its case; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; and - the considerations of the foreign order, as well as the judgment, do not contravene international public policy as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or have been given proceedings of a penal, criminal or tax nature (which would include awards of damages made under civil liabilities ----- provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, to the extent that the same would be classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages)) or rendered subsequent to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi). Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages such punitive damages may be considered as a penalty. If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law amongst others and notably (i) if the choice of such foreign law was not made in good faith (bona fide), (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law was contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg’s international public policy. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur may be refused in respect of a foreign judgment granting punitive damages. In practice, Luxembourg courts presently tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no clear statutory prohibition of such review. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in Euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into Euro. Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Luxembourg. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Luxembourg will be successful. -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,193

Furthermore, although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal securities laws.
