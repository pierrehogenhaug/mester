**OFFERING MEMORANDUM SUMMARY**

_In this offering memorandum, the words ‘‘KII,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘our’’ refer to Kronos International,_
_Inc., the issuer of the notes, and its subsidiaries. The following summary contains basic information about us_
_and this offering. It likely does not contain all the information that is important to you. For a more complete_
_understanding of this offering, we encourage you to read this entire document and the documents we have_
_referred you to._

**The Company**

We are the second largest producer of titanium dioxide pigments (‘‘TiO2’’) in Europe, with an estimated
18% share of European TiO2 sales volume. We are the leading producer and marketer of TiO2 in Germany,
with an estimated 25% share of sales volume in 2001, and are among the leading marketers of TiO2 in the
Benelux and Scandinavian markets. TiO2 is a pigment used to whiten, brighten and add opacity to thousands
of commonly used products, such as paints, plastics and paper, as well as fibers, rubber, ceramics, inks and
cosmetics. There are currently no effective substitutes for TiO2 for use in these applications. We market over
40 different TiO2 grades to over 4,000 customers in over 100 countries. We market our products through a
dedicated sales force in Europe and provide our customers with significant technical and application-related
services. Our predecessor companies were the first producers of TiO2 in the world, and we have achieved and
maintained our market position through our long-term customer relationships, our new product development
efforts, our commitment to product quality and by offering extensive technical and sales services.

We currently manufacture TiO2 in five plants in Europe (two in Leverkusen, Germany; one in
Nordenham, Germany; one in Langerbrugge, Belgium; and one in Fredrikstad, Norway), and sell and
distribute TiO2 from our plants and sales and distribution facilities located throughout Europe. Our plants are
currently capable of producing approximately 313,000 metric tons of TiO2 per year. Projected annual capacity
is expected to increase to approximately 328,000 metric tons in 2004 as a result of additional debottlenecking
that can be achieved through low cost capital investment.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2002, we had net sales of $535.2 million and operating income
plus depreciation and amortization expense less other general corporate expense, net (‘‘EBITDA’’), of
$122.6 million.

Some of the principal applications for our products include:

**_TiO2 for paints and coatings._** Our TiO2 is used to provide opacity, hiding power, durability,
tinting strength and brightness in industrial coatings, as well as for paints and coatings for home interiors
and exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings.
The amount of TiO2 used in paints and coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and
quality desired. Generally, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO2
content. Recent trends toward white and pastel-colored surface coatings and extended warranties for
appliances and other surface coated consumer durable items have resulted in higher usage in some
applications.

**_TiO2 for plastics._** We produce TiO2 pigments that improve the physical and optical properties in
plastics, including whiteness and opacity. TiO2 is used to provide opacity in items such as plastic
grocery bags, vinyl window and door profiles and vinyl siding, as well as in agricultural and packaging
film to provide opacity and allow the film to be printed for informational or advertising purposes. TiO2
also provides hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and durability for housewares, appliances, toys,
computer cases and food packages. TiO2’s high brightness, along with its opacity, is used in some
engineering plastics to help mask their undesirable natural color.

**_TiO2 for paper._** Our TiO2 is used in the production of paper to provide whiteness, brightness,
color stability and opacity. TiO2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including filled
paper, coated paper and laminate (decorative) paper. In filled paper applications, TiO2 is added directly
to the pulp and becomes part of the sheet itself. TiO2 is particularly useful in filled paper applications

1


-----

because of its ability to improve the physical appearance of paper without significant negative impact on
other performance characteristics as a result of the minimal quantities required. Without TiO2, high
opacity, lightweight papers could not be produced. TiO2 is used in paper coatings for production of high
gloss papers. TiO2 is also used in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together
using melamine resin under high temperature and pressure. The top layer of paper contains as much as
50% TiO2 and is the layer that is printed with decorative patterns. Paper laminates are used to replace
materials such as wood and tile for such applications as counter tops, furniture and wallboard. TiO2 is
beneficial in these applications because it assists in preventing the material from fading or changing
color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other weathering agents.

**_TiO2 for inks and textiles._** We produce TiO2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of printing
inks. TiO2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical
requirements of printing machinery, including speed and high temperatures. Our TiO2 is also used in
textile applications. TiO2 functions as an opacifying, brightening and delustering agent. In manmade
fibers such as rayon and polyester, TiO2 corrects undesirable characteristics such as glossy and
translucent appearance. Without the presence of TiO2, these materials would be unsuitable for use in
many textile applications.

**_TiO2 for other applications._** We produce high purity sulfate process anatase TiO2 used to provide
opacity, whiteness and brightness in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin
cream, lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste. Our TiO2 is also found in food products, such as candy and
confectionary, and in pet foods where it is used to obtain uniformity of color and appearance. In
pharmaceuticals, our TiO2 is used commonly as a colorant in pill and capsule coatings as well as in
liquid medicines to provide uniformity of color and appearance. Kronos purified anatase grades meet the
applicable requirements of the CTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP
(United States Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug
Administration).

We are also engaged in the mining and sale of ilmenite ore, a raw material used as a feedstock by
certain TiO2 plants. Our mining operations have an estimated annual production capacity of approximately
900,000 metric tons, and we have estimated ilmenite reserves of at least 20 years at the current rate of usage.
In 2001, we sold approximately 793,000 metric tons of ilmenite (699,000 metric tons in 2000), of which
243,000 metric tons were used internally in our sulfate-process TiO2 plants (304,000 metric tons in 2000) and
550,000 metric tons were sold to third-party customers (395,000 metric tons in 2000). The decrease in our
internal usage in 2001 was primarily due to a fire that occurred on March 20, 2001 that damaged a section of
our Leverkusen, Germany sulfate-process TiO2 plant and temporarily halted production at such plant.
Approximately 7% of our consolidated net sales in 2001 and 4% in 2000 represented ilmenite sales to
external customers.

**The TiO2 Industry**

The global TiO2 industry is concentrated. We, along with our North American affiliates and our five
largest competitors (E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.; Millennium Chemicals, Inc.; Huntsman International
Holdings LLC; Kerr-McGee Corporation; and Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd.) account for approximately 80%
of worldwide TiO2 production volume and approximately 86% of European TiO2 production volume. The
TiO2 industry has substantial requirements for entry, including proprietary production technology and
significant capital investment. Currently, total global capacity is approximately 4.4 million metric tons,
according to International Business Management Associates. Based upon current selling prices, the long lead
times required for planning, obtaining government approvals and construction and the fact that no new plants
are currently under construction, additional greenfield capacity is not expected in the next three to five years.
While we believe that current selling prices do not support new greenfield capacity, it is likely that producers
will continue to increase capacity over the next several years through incremental debottlenecking of existing
facilities. According to International Business Management Associates, prices of TiO2 are expected to be
positively impacted by limited investment in new capacity over the next three to five years.

-----

TiO2 is considered a ‘‘quality-of-life’’ product with demand affected by underlying global
macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, consumer disposable income and population. According to
International Business Management Associates, since 1980, growth in TiO2 consumption has averaged 2.9%
per year and did not decline during any two consecutive years. Although short-term influences, such as
customer and producer stocking and destocking activities, may have distorted TiO2’s growth trend, over the
long-term, GDP growth has historically been the primary underlying factor influencing growth in TiO2
demand. Additionally, the TiO2 industry experiences some seasonality in its sales as paint sales generally
peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater TiO2 sales
volume during the first half of the year. Per capita consumption of TiO2 in the United States and Western
Europe far exceeds that in other areas of the world and these regions are expected to continue to be the
largest consumers of TiO2. TiO2 demand in other regions of the world could increase as these economies
develop to the point that ‘‘quality-of-life’’ products using TiO2 become in greater demand.

The selling price of TiO2 is significantly affected by industry capacity and demand, with the last cyclical
peak for TiO2 prices having occurred in late 2000 and the highest peak pricing for TiO2 having occurred in
1990. Since late 2000 through early 2002, weak economic conditions worldwide have resulted in lower
customer purchasing and, as a result, TiO2 producers reduced their operating rates and the selling prices of
TiO2 declined. For example, our current TiO2 prices in billing currencies are approximately 8% below the
five-year average and approximately 25% below their historical high. Our average selling prices in billing
currencies in March 2002 were approximately 17% lower than prices in November 2000.

In the first quarter of 2002, all major producers announced price increases worldwide of 5% to 8% to be
implemented during the second quarter of 2002. During the period March 2002 through May 2002, TiO2 sales
volume increased 22% over the 2001 comparable period. We believe that this strong demand is primarily
attributable to improving economies and customers restocking their inventory levels ahead of the previously
announced price increases. Through May 2002, we have partially implemented the announced price increases,
with May 2002 prices in billing currencies up 2% over March 2002 prices. Also, in May 2002, we and other
major producers announced a second round of price increases for certain regions of the world, including
Europe. However, the extent, if any, to which price increases will be realized will depend on market
conditions.

TiO2 is manufactured using either the chloride or sulfate production process. Although most end-use
applications can use pigments produced by either process, chloride process pigments are generally preferred
in certain coatings and plastics applications and sulfate process pigments are generally preferred for paper,
fibers and ceramics applications. Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of
TiO2 industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process
pigments. In general, the chloride process is less intensive than the sulfate process in terms of capital
investment, labor and energy. Approximately 60% of global production capacity (and approximately 62% of
our production capacity) is based on chloride process technology with the remainder thereof based upon the
sulfate process.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

**_Leading market positions._** We enjoy a leading market position in TiO2, which gives us an
advantage over many of our competitors. Our predecessor companies were the first TiO2 producers in the
world and have manufactured TiO2 for 86 years. We are the second largest producer of TiO2 in Europe
and the largest in Germany, which has the largest economy in Europe. We are also among the leading
sellers of TiO2 in the Scandinavian, Benelux, Austrian and Swiss markets. We have a global presence
through our parent, Kronos, Inc. (‘‘Kronos’’), which sells our products in North America. We believe
that our strong presence in Western Europe strategically positions us to take advantage of growth within
the Eastern European markets.

**_Strong customer base._** Our experience in and commitment to the TiO2 industry are known by our
customers. We enjoy a high level of customer loyalty, which helps us maintain our leading market
positions. We have developed many long-term customer relationships through our broad product
offerings, packaging flexibility, strong technical support and customer service. We currently have over
4,000 customers, with the top ten customers accounting for approximately 23% of our sales and no
individual customer accounting for more than 6% of our sales. We also collaborate with our customers
to develop new TiO2 grades for key applications.

**_Broad product range._** We have one of the broadest product offerings in the TiO2 industry. We
supply grades made via both the chloride and the sulfate processes. We offer over 40 different TiO2
grades, including rutile, anatase and non-pigmentary grades, surface treated and non-surface treated
grades and dry and paper slurry grades. We offer a variety of packaging options to meet our customers’
needs, including 25 kilogram plastic and paper bags, Intermediate Bulk Containers in various sizes, bulk
deliveries of dry pigments to our customers’ silos and slurried pigments to the paper industry. We use
our product offering and packaging flexibility to help differentiate ourselves from the competition.

**_High performance products._** We have several key grades within our product range that we believe
have superior performance characteristics. We supply the leading chloride grade used in the manufacture
of PVC profiles in Europe, which are used to construct window frames, doorframes, window shades and
siding. This grade, with over 30 years of proven performance, holds over 50% of the market for
European PVC profiles. Other applications where we believe we hold a performance advantage include
chloride grades for paper laminate applications and engineering plastics and sulfate grades for
photographic films; purified anatase grades for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics markets; and
specialty anatase grades for the dry cell battery, capacitor, textile and fiber markets. We believe that our
customer relationships, the breadth of our product offerings and the performance of our grades in several
applications make it difficult for competitive grades to win the favor of our customers.

**_Proprietary chloride production technology._** We are the leading European chloride process
manufacturer, with annual chloride process capacity of approximately 194,000 metric tons using
proprietary technology. Certain of our customers, including many in the paint and plastics industries,
generally prefer chloride process pigments in part due to higher durability, high temperature tolerance
and blue tone characteristics. Proprietary production technology is also an important barrier to entry in
the TiO2 industry, as companies that possess such chloride technology are reluctant to license it to
competitors. Through debottlenecking, we have increased our chloride capacity by 40% since 1994,
including a debottlenecking project between 1996 and 1998 at our Leverkusen, Germany facility, which
added 20,000 metric tons of capacity. Approximately 62% of our product is produced with this
technology, while only 22% of competitors’ capacity in Europe utilizes the chloride process.

**_Experienced management team._** We are managed by an experienced and motivated group of
senior executive officers, with an average of 21 years of experience in the chemical industry. In addition
to our strong executive management team, we have an experienced group of operating managers who
work to maintain our strong TiO2 position.

4


-----

**_Captive ilmenite ore mining operations._** Our captive mining operations provide us a reliable
source of TiO2 feedstock for our sulfate process production plants at reduced cost, providing 100% of
the ore required for these plants. Nearly 40% of our mine’s production is used internally, and the
balance is sold to other pigment and titanium slag producers at competitive prices yielding profitable
margins.

**Our Strategy**

Our strategy is to increase value by:

) maximizing our earnings, cash flows and return on capital employed by reducing costs, increasing
efficiencies and optimizing existing assets; and

) increasing our competitiveness by expanding our size and market presence through internal growth
initiatives and technology innovation.

Specifically, to meet our goals, we strive to:

**_Improve operating efficiencies and margins._** We believe that our operations are among the most
efficient in the industry. We continue to focus on increasing manufacturing efficiencies through selected
capital projects, process improvement and best practices, in order to lower unit costs and improve our
margins. Our research and development, including process technology, focuses on improving production
processes, yields and qualities. These operating efficiencies have been accomplished through aggressive
operator training, innovative technology changes and constant equipment improvements. For example, we
continue to improve our chloride plants’ on-stream efficiency, and we anticipate further maintenance cost
reductions by extending by 40% to 50% the time that the plants’ chlorinators are in use, yielding annual
maintenance savings of approximately $4 million. We also have a newly designed acid scrubber and
newly designed pigment bag filter, which are expected to add approximately nine additional production
days per year per line. This is equivalent to approximately 4,500 metric tons per year. Prudent personnel
cost reductions are a continuous effort, which over approximately the last six years have resulted in an
approximate 13% reduction in manufacturing and support staff personnel, yielding annual savings of
approximately $11 million. These cost reduction programs have resulted in a significant improvement in
our fixed cost structure during a time when our production capacity has increased over 20%, leading to a
significant improvement in our margins. We intend to continue to use our manufacturing expertise to
lower costs, improve efficiency and enhance the performance and reliability of our product line.

**_Grow through technology and innovation._** We continue to improve the consistency of our grades
and develop new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of our customers and
increase product life cycles. For example, we have enhanced our product consistency and added new
grades for plastics, coatings, fiber and paper laminate applications. Specifically, in plastics applications,
one grade targeted for the growing engineering plastic segment provides excellent masking of the natural
yellowness of engineering plastics at high temperatures. Two other plastic grades were designed for use
in a range of polyolefin plastic resin applications, as they impart a desirable blue undertone to these
resins. We have also developed a new paper laminate grade that we expect to introduce later this year
designed to deliver higher opacity in this fast growing market segment.

**_Debottleneck existing facilities._** Increasing our production capacity with only moderate capital
outlays continues to be a major goal. Without any new plant or new line construction, our production
capacity has increased 20% over the last six years and we believe that our capacity can reach
approximately 328,000 metric tons during 2004 as a result of additional debottlenecking that can be
achieved through low cost capital investment.

**Certain Transactions and Refinancing**

In April 2002, we completed an internal restructuring of our operations in which we transferred our
Canadian operations to Kronos in contemplation of this offering. Pursuant to GAAP, our financial statements
were retroactively restated to exclude the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of such
Canadian operations for all periods presented. See note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Because of the April 2002 transfer of such Canadian operations, our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum include a consolidated
balance sheet as of April 30, 2002, and consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the four-month
periods ended April 30, 2001 and 2002.

We are implementing a refinancing of certain of our outstanding indebtedness. The sources of funds of
this refinancing are:

) the offering of the notes pursuant to this offering memorandum, and

) entering into our subsidiaries’ new 480 million credit facility.

As described in ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘Capitalization,’’ we will use the net proceeds from this
offering, plus cash on hand, to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness owed to Kronos. We will use
a portion of the borrowing available to us under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility, plus cash on hand, to
repay our outstanding short-term notes payable to third parties.

Upon completion of this offering, Kronos has agreed with us to contribute to our equity the remaining
balance of our outstanding indebtedness owed to it.

At March 31, 2002, we had approximately $691 million of outstanding redeemable preferred stock and
profit participation certificates (including cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon), all of which are held by
Kronos and are redeemable at our option or Kronos’ option. See note 16 to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Subsequent to the completion of this offering,
we will redeem such profit participation certificates in exchange for a portion of our outstanding notes
receivable from affiliates (as discussed in the immediately following paragraph), and we will convert the
redeemable preferred stock into our common stock, in one or more non-cash transactions. The ultimate result
of these transactions will be that our stockholder’s equity will increase by an amount equal to the carrying
value of all such redeemable preferred stock and profit participation certificates redeemed or converted into
our common stock. The redemption or conversion transactions will occur as soon as practicable after the
completion of this offering. See ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Data.’’

As of March 31, 2002, we had approximately $675 million of outstanding notes receivable from affiliates,
all of which are owed by either Kronos or NL Industries. Settlement of such notes receivable is not currently
contemplated in the foreseeable future, and consequently such notes receivable from affiliates are reported in
our consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of our stockholder’s equity in accordance with GAAP. See
note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. As soon as
practicable following the completion of this offering, we will transfer such notes receivable from affiliates to
Kronos in one or more non-cash transactions (by using a portion of them to redeem all of our outstanding
profit participation certificates and using the remainder as consideration to redeem a portion of our outstanding
common stock). Our reported stockholder’s equity would not be affected to the extent that such notes receivable
are used to redeem common stock. See ‘‘Capitalization’’ and ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Data.’’

(a) Operating income is defined as income before income taxes, minority interest, interest expense, interest expense to affiliates, certain
nonrecurring items and certain general corporate items. Corporate items excluded from operating income include corporate expense,
interest income from affiliates, gains and losses from the disposal of long-lived assets outside of the ordinary course of business and
currency transaction gains and losses related to our U.S. dollar-denominated note payable to Kronos. See note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(b) EBITDA, as presented, represents operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense less other general corporate expenses,
net, of $1.5 million in 2001. EBITDA is presented as a supplement to our operating income and cash flow from operations because
we believe that EBITDA is a widely accepted financial indicator of cash flows and the ability to service debt. EBITDA should not be
considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income or net income determined under GAAP as an indicator of
our operating performance, or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities determined under GAAP as a measure of
liquidity. EBITDA is not intended to depict funds available for reinvestment or other discretionary uses, as we have significant debt
requirements and other commitments. Investors should consider certain factors in evaluating our EBITDA, including interest expense,
income taxes, noncash income and expense items, changes in assets and liabilities, capital expenditures and other items included in
GAAP cash flows as well as future debt repayment requirements and other commitments, including those described in our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We believe that the trend of our EBITDA is
consistent with the trend of our GAAP operating income. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations’’ for a discussion of operating income and cash flows during the last three years and our outlook. EBITDA as
a measure of our performance may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential differences in
the method of calculation.

(c) Capital expenditures in 2001, the three months ended March 31, 2002 and the latest twelve months ended March 31, 2002 exclude an
aggregate of $22.3 million, $1.2 million and $23.5 million, respectively, related to the rebuilding of our Leverkusen, Germany sulfate
plant destroyed by fire, substantially all of which was reimbursed by insurance proceeds. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Investing cash flow’’ and note 14 to
the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(d) Calculated as current assets less current liabilities.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Before you invest in the notes, you should carefully consider the following factors in addition to the_
_other information contained in this offering memorandum._

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**Our leverage may impair our financial condition.**

We currently have, and after the issuance of the notes will continue to have, a significant amount of debt.
As of March 31, 2002, after giving effect to this offering and the application of the proceeds from the sale of
the notes as described in ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and certain other transactions affecting our indebtedness
described in ‘‘Capitalization’’ as if these transactions occurred on March 31, 2002, our total consolidated
debt would have been $272.9 million. See ‘‘Capitalization’’ for additional information.

Our level of debt could have important consequences to you, including:

) making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes;

) increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;

) requiring that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of
interest on our debt, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;

) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions and general corporate requirements;

) limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in
which we operate; and

) placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors.

Subject to specified limitations, the indenture will permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional debt,
including secured debt that may be secured by the collateral on a pari passu basis. In addition, following the
completion of this offering, we expect that our subsidiaries will have unused borrowing availability of
approximately $35 million under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility, subject to certain tests, all of which
borrowings would be senior, structurally, to the notes and would be secured by substantially all of the current
assets of such subsidiaries. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ current debt levels, then the
related risks that we and they now face could intensify. See ‘‘Description of Our Subsidiaries’ New Credit
Facility’’ for additional information.

**The notes are secured only by the pledge of 65% of the stock or other equity interests of certain of our**
**first-tier subsidiaries, and assets of our subsidiaries will first be applied to repay indebtedness and**
**liabilities of our subsidiaries and may not be sufficient to repay the notes.**

The notes are secured only by the pledge of 65% of the stock or other equity interests of certain of our
first-tier subsidiaries. Each of the stock pledges securing the notes will be made under and will be governed
by the local law of Denmark, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, as applicable, the jurisdictions
where our pledged subsidiaries are formed. As a result, the validity of those pledges and the ability of
noteholders to realize any benefits associated with the pledged shares may be limited under applicable local
law as any action to enforce the stock pledges must be taken under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction and
such laws may differ in significant respects from the laws of the United States. The rights of the trustee or
the noteholders to foreclose upon and sell the pledged shares upon the occurrence of a default will be subject
to limitations under applicable local bankruptcy laws if a bankruptcy proceeding were commenced against us
or our subsidiaries. Any delay or inability to realize any benefit associated with the security interest in any
jurisdiction or the application of local bankruptcy laws that are contrary to noteholders’ interests could have a
material adverse effect on the security interest we have granted in our subsidiaries and could result in an

13


-----

inability to realize the full value of the share pledges entered into in connection with the issuance of the
notes.

In addition to the foregoing, the notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the
indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries, which, on a pro forma basis as of March 31, 2002,
would have been approximately $220 million (including approximately $74 million in deferred income taxes)
recorded on our pro forma balance sheet. Furthermore, our debt under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility
will be secured by liens on substantially all of the current assets of our subsidiaries. The notes will not have
the benefit of this collateral, nor any other assets of our subsidiaries. Accordingly, if an event of default
occurs under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility, the lenders under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility will
have a right to such assets and may foreclose upon the collateral. In that case, such assets would first be used
to repay in full amounts outstanding under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility and may not be available to
repay the notes. In the event of a bankruptcy event affecting any of our subsidiaries, local bankruptcy law
would be likely to apply. In general, such local bankruptcy law affords significant protection for senior
secured creditors, and there can be no assurance that, in the event of a bankruptcy event, such creditors could
not take actions that would materially and adversely affect the value of our ongoing business and the equity
value of such subsidiaries. The remaining value, if any, of our assets may not be sufficient to repay the notes.

**Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash**
**depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.**

Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures
depends on our future ability to generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our
ability to borrow funds under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility in the future will depend on these
subsidiaries’ ability to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants contained in
the credit agreement for our subsidiaries’ new credit facility. As of March 31, 2002, after giving pro forma
effect to this offering and repayment of our then outstanding indebtedness with the net proceeds therefrom, as
if these transactions occurred on March 31, 2002, approximately $35 million would have been available for
general corporate purposes borrowing under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility. We cannot assure you that
our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under
our subsidiaries’ new credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other
liquidity needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt before maturity, and it is
likely that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on maturity. Our subsidiaries’ new three-year
credit facility matures in 2005. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on
favorable terms, if at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable
terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

**Covenant restrictions under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility and the indenture may limit our ability**
**to operate our business.**

Our subsidiaries’ new credit facility and the indenture governing the notes will contain, among other
things, covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in
other business activities. Our subsidiaries’ new credit facility and the indenture will restrict, among other
things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

) borrow money, pay dividends or make distributions;

) purchase or redeem stock;

) make investments and extend credit;

) engage in transactions with affiliates;

) engage in sale-leaseback transactions;

) freely distribute the proceeds from certain asset sales;

14


-----

) effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
of our assets; and

) create liens on our assets.

In addition, our subsidiaries’ new credit facility will require these subsidiaries to maintain specified
financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that action be taken to reduce
debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. Events beyond our control, including changes
in general business and economic conditions, may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and
financial condition tests. We cannot assure you that we will meet those tests or that the lenders will waive any
failure to meet those tests. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our
subsidiaries’ new credit facility and any resulting acceleration under the credit facility may result in a default
under the indenture. If an event of default under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility occurs, the lenders could
elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and
payable. See ‘‘Description of Our Subsidiaries’ New Credit Facility’’ and ‘‘Description of the Notes’’ for
additional information.

**If our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, we will not be able to make payments on**
**our debt, including the notes.**

Our assets consist primarily of investments in our operating subsidiaries. Our cash flow and our ability to
service indebtedness, including our ability to pay the interest on and principal of the notes, depend upon cash
dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. In addition, any payment of dividends,
distributions, loans or advances by our subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on or taxation of
dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign
currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, and any restrictions
imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our subsidiaries. Such payments to us by our
subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings.

Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities that have no obligation, contingent or otherwise,
to pay any amounts due pursuant to the notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends,
loans, distributions or other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, the
notes. Any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the liquidation or
reorganization of any such subsidiary, and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from
the sale of such assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including
trade creditors and holders of debt issued by the subsidiary.

**No public market exists for the notes, and this offering and sale of the notes are subject to significant**
**legal restrictions as well as uncertainties regarding the liquidity of the trading market for the notes.**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state or foreign securities laws. As a
result, you may only sell or resell notes if:

) there is an applicable exemption from the registration requirement of the Securities Act and applicable
state laws or foreign laws that applies to the circumstances of the sale; or

) we file a registration statement and it becomes effective.

Under the registration rights agreement applicable to the notes, we will be required to use our best
efforts to commence the exchange offer to exchange the notes for equivalent securities registered under the
Securities Act or to register the notes under the Securities Act. However, we cannot assure you that we will
be successful in having any such registration statement declared effective. See ‘‘Exchange Offer; Registration
Rights’’ and ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ for additional information.

The notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. Application will be made to
list the notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to
make a market in the notes after this offering is completed. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated

15


-----

to do so, and may cease market-making activities at any time. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance as
to:

) the likelihood that an active market for the notes will develop;

) the liquidity of any such market;

) the ability of holders to sell their notes; or

) the prices that holders may obtain for their notes upon any sale.

In addition, the liquidity of the trading market for the notes, if any, and the market price quoted for the
notes, will depend on many factors, including our operating results, the market for similar securities, currency
exchange rates and interest rates. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to
disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the notes. We cannot
guarantee that the market for the notes will not be subject to similar disruptions or that any such disruptions
will not have an adverse effect on the value or marketability of the notes.

**We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required**
**by the indenture.**

Upon a change of control, we are required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of the
face amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. The source of funds
for any such purchase of notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations
or other sources, including borrowing, sales of assets or sales of equity. We cannot assure you that sufficient
funds will be available at the time of any change of control to make any required repurchases of notes
tendered. If the holders of the notes exercise their right to require us to repurchase all of the notes upon a
change of control, the financial effect of this repurchase could cause a default under our other debt, even if
the change of control itself would not cause a default. Accordingly, it is possible that we will not have
sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of notes. See
‘‘Description of the Notes — Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of Our Subsidiaries’ New Credit
Facility’’ for additional information.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**Demand for our products is cyclical and we may experience prolonged depressed market conditions for**
**our products, which may adversely affect our ability to make payments on the notes.**

Substantially all of our revenue is attributable to sales of TiO2, the price of which has been historically
cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general market and economic conditions.
Historically, the market for TiO2 has experienced alternating periods of tight supply, causing prices and profit
margins to increase, followed by periods of oversupply and declining prices and profit margins. Recently, our
markets are experiencing periods of oversupply due to a global economic downturn, which has contributed to
depressed pricing of our products in these markets. We cannot guarantee that future growth in demand for
these products will be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions of excess industry capacity or
that such conditions will not be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated changes in
economic conditions, capacity additions or other events.

**We sell our products in a mature and highly competitive industry and face price pressure in the**
**markets in which we operate.**

The global markets in which we operate our business are highly competitive. Competition is based on a
number of factors, such as price, product quality and service. Some of our competitors may be able to drive
down prices for our products because they have costs that are lower than ours. In addition, some of our
competitors may have greater financial, technological and other resources than ours, and may be better able to
withstand changes in market conditions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or

16


-----

emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can. Further, consolidation of our
competitors or customers in any of the industries in which we compete may have an adverse effect on us. The
occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

**We are subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or**
**liabilities.**

We are subject to extensive laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, the protection of
the environment and the use or cleanup of hazardous substances and wastes. We may incur substantial costs,
including fines, damages and criminal penalties or civil sanctions, or experience interruptions in our
operations for actual or alleged violations or compliance requirements arising under environmental laws. Our
operations could result in violations under environmental laws, including spills or other releases of hazardous
substances to the environment. Some of our operating facilities are in densely populated urban areas or in
industrial areas adjacent to other operating facilities. In the event of a catastrophic incident, we could incur
material costs as a result of addressing such an event and in implementing measures to prevent such
incidents. Given the nature of our business, violations of environmental laws may result in restrictions
imposed on our operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages or other costs, including as a result
of private litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. See ‘‘Business — Regulatory and Environmental Matters’’ and ‘‘— Legal
Proceedings.’’

In addition, we could incur significant expenditures to comply with existing or future environmental laws.
Capital expenditures and, to a lesser extent, costs and operating expenses relating to environmental matters
will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of promulgation and
enforcement of specific standards that impose requirements on our operations. We cannot, therefore, assure
you that capital expenditures beyond those currently anticipated will not be required under environmental
laws. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’

**We have a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials, which could negatively affect us.**

We have a limited number of suppliers for some of our raw materials, and the number of sources for and
availability of certain raw materials is specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is
located. In addition, in 2001, we purchased titanium-bearing ores from three suppliers under multiple-year
agreements. If one of these suppliers were unable to meet its obligations under present supply arrangements,
we could suffer reduced supplies or be forced to incur increased prices for our raw materials.

**If we are unable to maintain our relationship with Kronos and its affiliates, we may not be able to**
**replace on favorable terms our contracts with them and facilities that they provide, if at all.**

We have entered into and intend to continue to enter into certain agreements, including service, supply
and buy/sell agreements, with Kronos and its affiliates. If Kronos or any of its affiliates fails to perform its
obligations under any of these agreements, or if any of these agreements terminate or we are otherwise unable
to obtain the benefits thereunder for any reason, there could be a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows if we are unable to obtain similar agreements on the
same terms from third parties. See ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.’’

**Kronos and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with us, and these conflicts could adversely affect**
**our business.**

For so long as Kronos and its affiliates retain their direct and indirect ownership interests in KII,
conflicts of interest could arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and them,
potential acquisitions of business or properties, the issuance of additional securities, our payment of dividends
and other matters. In addition, affiliates of Kronos are also engaged in the business of producing and selling

17


-----

TiO2 and may compete with us. See ‘‘Description of Notes — Certain Covenants — Limitations on
Transactions with Affiliates.’’

**We could be adversely affected if NL Industries suffers adverse consequences from lawsuits.**

We are wholly-owned by Kronos, which in turn is wholly-owned by NL Industries, a publicly-held
corporation subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Commission. NL Industries is a
defendant in numerous lawsuits, including environmental claims and claims involving the past manufacture
and sale in the United States of lead pigments for use in paint for buildings, all as disclosed in NL
Industries’ filings with the Commission. Neither we nor our subsidiaries has ever been named as a defendant
in any of such lawsuits against NL Industries. Nevertheless, judgments against NL Industries in litigation
could have adverse consequences for us and holders of the notes. Such events could impose economic
hardships on NL Industries, which in turn could make future financings, including bank borrowings, more
difficult for Kronos and for us and also could adversely affect our customers’ perceptions of us as an affiliate
of NL Industries. In addition, judgments against NL Industries might force NL Industries to divest its equity
ownership of Kronos or us to raise cash, which could result in a change of control of us. See ‘‘Description of
the Notes — Change of Control’’ for additional information.

**Terrorist attacks, such as the attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, and**
**other attacks or acts of war, may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our operations and**
**our profitability.**

On September 11, 2001, the United States was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scope.
These attacks caused major instability in the U.S. and other financial markets. Leaders of the
U.S. government have announced their intention to actively pursue those behind the attacks and to possibly
initiate broader action against global terrorism. The attacks and any response may lead to armed hostilities or
further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere, and such developments would likely cause further
instability in financial markets. In addition, armed hostilities and further acts of terrorism may directly impact
our physical facilities and operations, which are located in Europe, or those of our customers. Furthermore,
the recent terrorist attacks and future developments may result in reduced demand from our customers for our
products or disruption of supplies of raw materials. These developments may subject our operations to
increased risks and, depending on their magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business and
your investment.

**Our business may be adversely affected by international operations and fluctuations in currency**
**exchange rates.**

We conduct all of our business in several foreign jurisdictions and are subject to risks normally
associated with international operations. These risks include the need to convert currencies that we may
receive for some of our products into currencies required to pay some of our debt, or into currencies in which
we purchase certain raw materials or pay for certain services, all of which could result in a gain or loss
depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. Other risks of international operations include trade barriers,
tariffs, exchange controls, national and regional labor strikes, social and political risks, general economic
risks, required compliance with a variety of foreign laws, including tax laws, and the difficulty in enforcing
agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems.

**If our patents are declared invalid or our trade secrets become known to competitors, our ability to**
**compete may be adversely affected.**

Protection of our proprietary processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business.
Consequently, we rely on judicial enforcement for protection of our patents, and there can be no assurance
that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable.
Furthermore, if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent, or if patents are
issued to us, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property, then the use
of any such intellectual property by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business,

18


-----

financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties
may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a
competitive manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

We also rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other
trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although it is our policy to enter into
confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, because
these confidentiality agreements may be breached, such agreements may not provide meaningful protection for
our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an
unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. In addition, others could obtain
knowledge of such trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means. The failure
of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets or
proprietary know-how could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

19


-----

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The net proceeds to be received by us from the sale of the notes, after deducting placement fees and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, are estimated to be approximately
$229.7 million. We intend to use all of such net proceeds to repay in full the principal and accrued interest
on our 11.75% second-tier senior mirror note and repay a portion of other notes payable to affiliates. See note
8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

As our 11.75% second-tier senior mirror note does not permit prepayment, the underlying NL Industries
11.75% senior secured notes must first or contemporaneously be repurchased or redeemed in order for each
of us and Kronos to prepay our respective mirror notes. There is a 45-day notice period for NL Industries’
redemption of its 11.75% senior secured notes, consisting of 15 days notice to the trustee for such notes and
30 days notice to the holders of such notes. NL Industries has agreed in writing with us that, on or before
June 10, 2002, NL Industries will transmit a notice to the trustee for NL Industries’ 11.75% senior secured
notes with irrevocable instructions to transmit notice of redemption to the holders of such notes promptly
following the closing of the sale of our notes and receipt by the trustee, in the trust account described below,
of an amount sufficient to repay in full the principal and accrued interest on NL Industries’ 11.75% senior
secured notes (the ‘‘Repayment Funds’’). NL Industries has also agreed in writing with us that, immediately
following the closing of this offering, the portion of the net proceeds from this offering constituting
Repayment Funds will be transferred to a trust account to be maintained by the trustee, effectively
constituting a loan to NL Industries. The Repayment Funds will be invested by the trustee in short term
United States government securities, with the Repayment Funds to be applied to redeem in full NL Industries’
11.75% senior secured notes upon expiration of the notice period to the holders, and with any funds
remaining in escrow following such repayment in full to be paid to us. Upon redemption of NL Industries’
11.75% senior secured notes, our 11.75% second-tier senior mirror note will be deemed repaid in full.

Except as otherwise noted, Euro amounts in this offering memorandum have been presented in U.S.
dollars at an exchange rate of 41.00 to $0.87, based on the closing spot rate on March 31, 2002 reported by
Bloomberg. The closing spot rate on June 5, 2002 was 41.00 to $0.94 as reported by Bloomberg.

(c) Represents 4270 million ($236 million) aggregate principal amount of notes offered hereby.

(d) Represents the payoff of our 11.75% second-tier senior mirror note payable to affiliate ($169 million) and the payoff of a portion of
our other note payable to affiliate ($82 million) using the net proceeds of this offering and available cash, and the contribution of the

(e) Represents the elimination, by way of redemption or conversion into our common stock of $691 million of our redeemable preferred
stock and profit participation certificates in one or more non-cash transactions, the ultimate result of which will be that our
stockholder’s equity will increase by an amount equal to the carrying value of such redeemable preferred stock and profit
participation certificates redeemed or converted.

We have a significant amount of notes payable to affiliates (see note 8 to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum). A portion of such notes payable to affiliates
will be repaid using the net proceeds of this offering and available cash. Kronos, which holds such notes
payable, has agreed that any remaining amount of such notes payable to affiliates will be contributed to our
equity following completion of this offering.

At March 31, 2002, we had approximately $691 million of outstanding redeemable preferred stock and
profit participation certificates (including cumulative and unpaid dividends thereon), all of which are held by
Kronos and are redeemable at our option or Kronos’ option. See note 16 to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Subsequent to the completion of this offering,
we will redeem such profit participation certificates in exchange for a portion of our outstanding notes
receivable from affiliates (as discussed in the immediately following paragraph), and we will convert the

21


-----

redeemable preferred stock into our common stock, in one or more non-cash transactions. The ultimate result
of these transactions will be that our stockholder’s equity will increase by an amount equal to the carrying
value of all such redeemable preferred stock and profit participation certificates redeemed or converted into
our common stock. The redemption or conversion transactions will occur as soon as practicable after the
completion of this offering. See ‘‘Offering Memorandum Summary — Certain Transactions and Refinancing’’
and ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Data.’’

As of March 31, 2002, we had approximately $675 million of outstanding notes receivable from
affiliates, all of which are owed by either Kronos or NL Industries. Settlement of such notes receivable is not
currently contemplated in the foreseeable future, and consequently such notes receivable from affiliates are
reported in our consolidated balance sheet as a reduction of our stockholder’s equity in accordance with
GAAP. See note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.
As soon as practicable following the completion of this offering, we will transfer such notes receivable from
affiliates to Kronos in one or more non-cash transactions (by using a portion of them to redeem all of our
outstanding profit participation certificates and using the remainder as consideration to redeem a portion of
our outstanding common stock). Our reported stockholder’s equity would not be affected to the extent such
notes receivable are used to redeem our common stock. See ‘‘Offering Memorandum Summary — Certain
Transactions and Refinancing’’ and ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Data.’’

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA**

The following unaudited pro forma financial data is based on our historical financial statements and
reflects the following:

) the issuance of 4270 million (approximately $235.7 million) of notes in this offering;

) borrowings outstanding of approximately $35 million under our subsidiaries’ new credit facility;

) the repayment in full of all outstanding principal on our 11.75% second-tier senior mirror note
($169 million at March 31, 2002);

) the repayment in full of short-term notes payable to third parties ($46 million at March 31, 2002);

) the repayment of other of our existing affiliate indebtedness ($82 million at March 31, 2002);

) the contribution of the remaining balance of our other note payable to affiliate ($201 million at
March 31, 2002) to our equity;

) the elimination, by way of redemption or conversion into our common stock, of our redeemable
preferred stock and profit participation certificates held by Kronos ($691 million at March 31, 2002)
in one or more non-cash transactions, the ultimate result of which will be that our stockholder’s equity
will increase by an amount equal to the carrying value of such redeemable preferred stock and profit
participation certificates redeemed or converted; and

) the elimination of our notes receivable from Kronos and NL Industries.

Pro forma adjustments to historical financial statements include adjustments that we deem appropriate,
reflecting items of recurring significance and that are factually supported based on currently available
information. We assumed that the transactions described above occurred on March 31, 2002 for purposes of
preparing the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of that date, and we assumed that the
transactions described above occurred on January 1, 2001 for purposes of preparing the pro forma condensed
consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the three months ended
March 31, 2002 and 2001. The pro forma financial statements may not be indicative of what actually would
have been, nor do the pro forma financial statements purport to present our consolidated financial results for
future periods.

The unaudited pro forma financial data have been derived from our historical consolidated financial
statements. The pro forma adjustments, as described in the notes that follow, are based upon available
information and upon certain assumptions that management believes to be reasonable. You should read this
information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in
this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro forma financial data are included for comparative purposes
only.

Amounts in U.S. dollars have been translated from euro at the rate of 41.00 to $0.87, in the unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and at the rate of 41.00 to $0.90, $0.92, $0.87 and $0.88 for
the respective unaudited pro forma condensed statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2001,
the three months ended March 31, 2001, the three months ended March 31, 2002 and the last twelve months
ended March 31, 2002, respectively.

currency transaction gains and losses related to our U.S. dollar-denominated note payable to Kronos. See note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(b) Capital expenditures in 2001 and the three months ended March 31, 2002 exclude an aggregate of $22.3 million and $1.2 million,
respectively, related to the rebuilding of our Leverkusen, Germany sulfate plant destroyed by fire, substantially all of which was
reimbursed by insurance proceeds. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —

this offering memorandum.

(c) EBITDA, as presented, represents operating income plus depreciation and amortization expense less other general corporate expenses,
net, of $1.5 million in 2001. EBITDA is presented as a supplement to our operating income and cash flow from operations because
we believe that EBITDA is a widely accepted financial indicator of cash flows and the ability to service debt. EBITDA should not be
considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income or net income determined under GAAP as an indicator of
our operating performance, or cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities determined under GAAP as a measure of
liquidity. EBITDA is not intended to depict funds available for reinvestment or other discretionary uses, as we have significant debt
requirements and other commitments. Investors should consider certain factors in evaluating our EBITDA, including interest expense,
income taxes, noncash income and expense items, changes in assets and liabilities, capital expenditures, and other items included in
GAAP cash flows as well as future debt repayment requirements and other commitments, including those described in our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We believe that the trend of our EBITDA is
consistent with the trend of our GAAP operating income. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations’’ for a discussion of operating income and cash flows during the last three years and our outlook. EBITDA as
a measure of our performance may not be comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential differences in
the method of calculation.

(d) Calculated as current assets less current liabilities.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF**
**FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The accompanying ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations’’ is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an
on-going basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventory reserves, the recoverability of
other long-lived assets, pensions and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto, and the realization
of deferred income tax assets and accruals for environmental remediation, income tax and other
contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from
previously-estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

) We provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable finished goods inventory equal to the
difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about
future demand for our products and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by us, additional finished goods inventory reserves may be required. We provide
reserves for tools and supplies inventory generally based on both historical and expected future usage
requirements.

) We recognize an impairment charge associated with our long-lived assets, including property and
equipment, whenever we determine that recovery of such long-lived asset is not probable. Such
determination is made in accordance with the applicable GAAP requirements associated with the longlived asset, and is based upon, among other things, estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to
be generated by the long-lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset. Adverse
changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an
inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived asset, thereby possibly requiring an impairment
charge to be recognized in the future.

) We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that we
believe to be realizable under the ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ recognition criteria. While we have
considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing
the need for a valuation allowance, it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the
amount of the deferred income tax assets that would ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ be realized, resulting in
an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or
decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made.

) We record an accrual for environmental, income tax and other contingencies when estimated future
expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable, and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated. However, new information may become available, or circumstances (such as applicable laws
and regulations) may change, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be
accrued for such matters (and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of
such change).

**Results of Operations**

**_General_**

We derive the majority of our revenues, earnings and cash flow from the production and sale of TiO2. As
discussed below, average TiO2 selling prices in billing currencies (which excludes the effects of foreign
currency translation), were decreasing during the first three quarters of 1999, were generally increasing during
the fourth quarter of 1999 and most of 2000, and were generally decreasing during most of 2001 and the first
quarter of 2002.

Many factors influence TiO2 pricing levels, including (i) industry capacity, (ii) worldwide demand
growth, (iii) customer inventory levels and purchasing decisions, (iv) competitor actions and decisions and
(v) relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that the TiO2 industry has long-term
growth potential, as discussed in ‘‘Business — Industry’’ and ‘‘— Competition.’’

The following table sets forth certain information concerning our results of operations for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, and the first three months of 2001 and 2002.

Net income ******************************** $ 41.9 $ 80.1 $113.7 $ 19.7 $ 8.0

We expect TiO2 industry demand in 2002 to continue to improve over 2001 levels, as we expect
worldwide economic conditions to improve and customer inventory levels to increase. Sales volumes for our
TiO2 in the March 2002 to May 2002 period increased 22% over the 2001 comparable period. We believe that
this strong demand is primarily attributable to improving economic conditions and customers restocking their
inventory levels ahead of the price increases noted below. Our TiO2 production volume in 2002 is expected to
approximate our 2002 TiO2 sales volume. In January 2002, we announced price increases in all major markets
of approximately 8% above existing December 2001 prices, scheduled to be implemented during the second
quarter of 2002. Through May 2002, we have partially implemented the increase announced in January 2002,
with May 2002 prices in billing currencies up 2% over March 2002 prices. Also, in May 2002, we and other
major producers announced a second round of price increases for certain regions of the world, including
Europe. However, the extent, if any, to which price increases will be realized will depend on market
conditions. In addition, because TiO2 prices were declining in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, we believe
that our average 2002 prices in billing currencies will be significantly below our average 2001 prices, even if
price increases are realized. Overall, we expect our TiO2 operating income in 2002 will be significantly lower
than 2001, primarily due to lower average TiO2 selling prices. Our expectations as to our and the TiO2
industry’s future prospects are based upon a number of factors beyond our control, including worldwide
growth of gross domestic product, competition in the marketplace, unexpected or earlier-than-expected
capacity additions and technological advances. If actual developments differ from our expectations, our results
of operations could be unfavorably affected.

Our operating income in the first quarter of 2002 decreased $24.0 million or 63% from the first quarter
of 2001 due to lower average selling prices partially offset by higher sales volume.

Our average selling price in billing currencies (which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation)
during the first quarter of 2002 was 16% lower than the first quarter of 2001 and 5% lower than the fourth
quarter of 2001. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2001, prices in billing currencies were lower in all
major markets. The average selling price in billing currencies in March was less than 1% lower than the
average selling price during the first quarter. Average selling prices in billing currencies continued to decline
throughout the first quarter, however, the rate of decline slowed during the first quarter.

Our sales volume in the first quarter of 2002 increased 10% from the first quarter of 2001 and increased
32% from the fourth quarter of 2001. Finished goods inventory decreased approximately 6,900 metric tons
during the quarter and inventory levels at the end of March represented about two months of sales.

Our production volume in the first quarter of 2002 was comparable to the 2001 prior period with
operating rates at 97% in the first quarter of 2002 compared with near full capacity in the first quarter of
2001.

A fire on March 20, 2001 damaged a section of our Leverkusen, Germany 35,000 metric ton sulfateprocess TiO2 plant and, as a result, production of TiO2 at the Leverkusen facility was halted. The fire did not
enter our adjacent 125,000 metric ton chloride-process TiO2 plant, but did damage certain support equipment
necessary to operate that plant. The damage to the support equipment resulted in a temporary shutdown of
the chloride plant. The chloride plant became fully operational in April 2001 and the sulfate plant became
approximately 50% operational in September 2001 and fully operational in late October 2001.

Compared to the year-earlier period, cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased in the first
quarter of 2002 primarily due to lower average selling prices in billing currencies, partially offset by lower
energy costs. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, which decreased our expenses in the first
quarter of 2002 compared to year-earlier period, our selling, general and administrative expenses in the first
quarter of 2002 were comparable to the first quarter of 2001.

The majority of our sales and operating costs are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily a stronger U.S. dollar
compared to the euro in the first quarter of 2002 versus the year-earlier period, decreased the dollar value of
sales in the first quarter of 2002 when compared to the year-earlier period. When translated from billing
currencies to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods, our firstquarter 2002 average selling price in U.S. dollars was 14% lower than in the first quarter of 2001 and 4%
lower than the fourth quarter of 2001. The effect of the stronger U.S. dollar on our operating costs that are
not denominated in U.S. dollars reduced operating costs in the first quarter of 2002 compared to the year
33


-----

earlier period. In addition, sales to export markets are typically denominated in U.S. dollars and a stronger
U.S. dollar improves margins on these sales. The favorable margin on export sales tends to offset the
unfavorable effect of translating local currency profits to U.S. dollars when the dollar is stronger. As a result,
the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income in the first quarter of 2002 was not
significant when compared to the first quarter of 2001.

Our operating income in 2001, including business interruption proceeds of approximately $27 million,
was lower than 2000, primarily due to lower average TiO2 selling prices in billing currencies and lower sales
and production volumes. Our operating income for 2000 was higher than 1999 due to higher average TiO2
selling prices in billing currencies and higher production and sales volumes.

Average TiO2 selling prices in billing currencies during 2001 were 2% lower than 2000, with lower
prices in all major regions. Pigment prices decreased from the preceding quarter during each quarter of 2001,
reversing the upward trend that began in the fourth quarter of 1999 and continued through the fourth quarter
of 2000. The rate of price declines increased in the fourth quarter of 2001 to 5% over the third quarter of
2001, and December 2001 prices were 2% lower than the average selling price for the quarter. The average
selling price in billing currencies in December 2001 was 13% below the December 2000 average selling
price. The most significant price erosion during this time period occurred in the European and export
markets. Average TiO2 selling prices in billing currencies in 2000 were 7% higher than 1999, with higher
prices in all major regions.

Industry-wide demand was weak throughout 2001 as compared to 2000 and 1999 levels. Sales volume of
265,000 metric tons of TiO2 in 2001 was 10% lower than 2000, primarily due to lower European sales. Sales
volume in 2000 was 1% higher than 1999. Industry-wide demand was weak in early 1999. Demand in the
second half of 1999 and the first three quarters of 2000 was stronger than comparable year-earlier periods we
believe as a result of, among other things, customers buying in advance of anticipated price increases.
Demand softened in the fourth quarter of 2000 and weakened throughout 2001.

Our production volume was 269,000 metric tons in 2001, a decrease of 9% from 297,000 metric tons
produced in 2000. Operating rates were down in 2001 from near full capacity in 2000, primarily due to lost
production resulting from the Leverkusen fire and our decision to curtail production in the fourth quarter of
2001. Our production volume in 2000 increased 9% compared with the 272,000 metric tons produced in
1999. Operating rates in 1999 were 90%. Production volume was curtailed in the beginning of the first
quarter of 1999 in order to manage inventory levels. Finished goods inventory levels increased in the fourth
quarter of 2001 and at the end of 2001 represented approximately two months of sales.

A fire on March 20, 2001 damaged a section of our Leverkusen, Germany 35,000 metric ton sulfateprocess TiO2 plant and, as a result, production of TiO2 at the Leverkusen facility was halted. The fire did not
enter our adjacent 125,000 metric ton chloride-process TiO2 plant, but did damage certain support equipment

necessary to operate that plant. The damage to the support equipment resulted in a temporary shutdown of
the chloride plant. The chloride plant became fully operational in April 2001 and the sulfate plant became
approximately 50% operational in September 2001 and fully operational in late October 2001.

We settled our insurance claim involving the Leverkusen fire for $56.4 million during the fourth quarter of
2001 ($46.9 million received as of December 31, 2001, with the remaining $9.5 million received in January
2002), of which $27.3 million related to business interruption and $29.1 million related to property damage,
clean-up costs and other extra expenses. We recognized a $17.5 million pre-tax gain in 2001 related to the
property damage recovery after deducting $11.6 million of clean-up costs and other extra expenses incurred and
the carrying value of assets destroyed in the fire. The gain was excluded from the determination of operating
income. The $27.3 million of business interruption proceeds recognized in 2001 were allocated between other
income, excluding corporate, which reflected recovery of lost margin ($7.2 million) and as a reduction of cost
of sales to offset unallocated period costs ($20.1 million). We do not expect to receive any additional insurance
recoveries related to the Leverkusen fire, and there was no impact on our results of operations in the first
quarter of 2002.

Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, which reduced our expenses in both 2001 and 2000
compared to the year-earlier periods, our cost of sales in 2001 was lower than 2000 due to lower sales
volume partially offset by higher unit costs, which resulted primarily from lower production levels. The
effects of lower TiO2 sales volume and production volume were partially offset by business interruption
proceeds. Our cost of sales in 2000 was lower than 1999 primarily due to lower unit costs, which resulted
primarily from higher production levels. Cost of sales, as a percentage of net sales, increased in 2001
primarily due to the impact on net sales of lower average selling prices and higher unit costs partially offset
by business interruption insurance recoveries, and decreased in 2000 primarily due to the impact on net sales
of higher average selling prices and lower unit costs.

Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, which reduced our expenses in both 2001 and 2000
compared to the year-earlier periods, selling, general and administrative expenses (‘‘SG&A’’), excluding
corporate expenses, decreased in 2001 from the year-earlier period due to lower variable compensation
expense and lower selling and distribution expenses associated with lower 2001 sales volume. SG&A,
excluding corporate expenses, increased in 2000 from the year-earlier period primarily due to higher variable
compensation expense and higher selling and distribution expenses associated with higher 2000 sales
volumes. SG&A, excluding corporate expenses, as a percentage of net sales, was 12% in each of 2001 and
2000 and 13% in 1999. See discussion of corporate expenses below.

The majority of our sales and operating costs are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which
may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period-to-period revenues and expenses
expressed in U.S. dollars. A significant amount of our sales (79% in 2001) are denominated in currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro and other major European currencies. Certain purchases of raw
materials, primarily titanium-containing feedstocks for our chloride process plants, are denominated in
U.S. dollars, while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies.
Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily a stronger U.S. dollar
compared to the euro, decreased sales during 2001 and 2000, respectively, compared with the year-earlier
period. When translated to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective
periods, our average selling prices for 2001 decreased 2% from 2000. Our average selling prices in
U.S. dollars for 2000 increased 14% from 1999. The effect of the stronger U.S. dollar on our operating costs
that are not denominated in U.S. dollars reduced operating costs in 2001 and 2000 compared with the
respective prior year. In addition, sales to export markets are typically denominated in U.S. dollars and a
stronger U.S. dollar improves margins on these sales. The favorable margin on export sales tends to offset the
unfavorable effect of translating local currency profits to U.S. dollars when the dollar is stronger. As a result,
the net impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased operating income in 2001 and 2000 by
approximately 7% and 19% when compared to the year-earlier periods.

We have certain loans to affiliates, more fully described in note 17 to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Interest income on such notes receivable from
affiliates was higher in 2000 and 2001 compared to the respective prior year, and was higher in the first three
months of 2002 compared to the same period in 2001, due primarily to higher average balances of
outstanding loans to affiliates. Subsequent to completion of this offering (and as more fully described above
in ‘‘Offering Memorandum Summary — Certain Transactions and Refinancing’’), we will transfer such notes
receivable from affiliates to Kronos, and accordingly we will no longer report interest income on such loans
to affiliates.

The insurance recoveries, net in 2001 related to insurance proceeds received from property damage
resulting from the Leverkusen fire, as the insurance proceeds received exceeded the carrying value of the
assets destroyed and the clean-up costs and extra expense incurred. See note 14 to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

We have certain loans from affiliates that are denominated in U.S. dollars. Under GAAP, changes in the
euro-equivalent of such indebtedness is recognized in our earnings as a foreign currency transaction gain or
loss. The amount of such currency transaction gain or loss is dependent upon the relative change in the
exchange rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar during each period, and the amount of such U.S. dollardenominated indebtedness outstanding. See note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum. As more fully described above in ‘‘Offering Memorandum Summary — Certain
Transactions and Refinancing,’’ such U.S. dollar-denominated loans from affiliates will be repaid using a
portion of the proceeds of this offering, and accordingly we will no longer report such currency transaction
gains or losses related to such loans from affiliates.

Other corporate expenses, net in 2001 of $1.5 million, related to German real estate transfer taxes
associated with a legal restructuring of our German operations.

Interest expense in the first quarter of 2002 was higher than the comparable period in 2001 due to a
higher level of outstanding affiliate indebtedness, partially offset by reduced levels of short term notes
payable. Interest expense in 2001 was higher than 2000 primarily due to higher levels of bank debt and
affiliate debt. Interest expense in 2000 declined compared to 1999 due to reduced levels of outstanding eurobank debt. See notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. As more fully described above in ‘‘Offering Memorandum Summary — Certain Transactions
and Refinancing,’’ a portion of such loans from affiliates will be repaid using the proceeds of this offering
with the remaining balance contributed to our equity, and accordingly we will no longer report interest
expense on such loans from affiliates.

**_Provision for income taxes_**

The principal reasons for the difference between the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rates and our
effective income tax rates are explained in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum. Our operations are conducted in numerous jurisdictions, and the geographic
mix of income can significantly impact our effective income tax rate. In 2001, our effective income tax rate
varied from the normally expected rate primarily due to the recognition of certain German income tax
attributes which previously did not meet the ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ recognition criteria. In 2000, our
effective income tax rate varied from the normally expected rate primarily due to the geographic mix of
income and changes in the German income tax ‘‘base’’ rate. In 1999, our effective tax rate varied from the
normally expected rate due predominantly to the recognition of certain deductible tax attributes which
previously did not meet the ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ recognition criteria. In each of 1999, 2000 and 2001, no
income tax benefit has been provided on certain currency transaction losses. Also in 2000 and 1999, we
recognized certain one-time benefits related to German tax settlements.

**_Related party transactions_**

**_Operating cash flows_**

Certain items included in the determination of net income do not represent current operating inflows or
outflows of cash. For example, insurance recoveries, net of $17.5 million in 2001 are excluded from the
determination of operating cash flow. These insurance proceeds are shown in the statement of cash flows
under investing activities to partially offset the cash outflow impact of capital expenditures related to the
Leverkusen sulfate plant reconstruction. Certain other items included in the determination of net income have
an impact on cash flows from operating activities, but the impact of such items on cash will differ from their
impact on net income.

The TiO2 industry is cyclical and changes in economic conditions within the industry significantly
impact our earnings and operating cash flows. Cash flow from operations, before changes in assets and
liabilities, decreased $18.5 million in the first three months of 2002 from the comparable period primarily due
to $24.0 million of lower operating income, partially offset by $6.2 million of lower current tax expense.

Operating cash flows, before changes in assets and liabilities, in 2001 compared with 2000 were
unfavorably affected by $22.3 million of lower operating income, $2.4 million of higher non-affiliate cash
interest expense and $1.5 million of higher corporate expenses, partially offset by $16.6 million of lower
current tax expense and $5.8 million of lower cash interest expense, net to affiliates. Operating cash flows,
before changes in assets and liabilities, in 2000 compared with 1999 were favorably affected by $55.6 million
higher operating income, $5.7 million of lower non-affiliate cash interest expense, partially offset by
$19.8 million of higher current tax expense.

The net cash used to fund changes in our inventories, receivables and payables (excluding the effect of
currency translation) in the first three months of 2002 was less than the first three months of 2001, with
$9.1 million lower inventory balances, $16.8 million lower accounts and notes receivable balances, which
included the collection of $9.5 million of insurance proceeds, and $9.2 million lower affiliate balances,
partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3.1 million.

Changes in our assets and liabilities (excluding the effect of currency translation) in 2001 compared with
2000 were unfavorably affected by higher affiliate balances of $21.4 million, partially offset by $5.5 million
lower accounts and notes receivable balances.

Changes in our assets and liabilities (excluding the effect of currency translation) in 2000 compared with
1999 were unfavorably affected by higher inventories of $28.4 million and $5.0 million of lower accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by lower accounts and notes receivable balances of
$12.3 million and $7.9 million of higher affiliate balances.

**_Investing cash flows_**

Capital expenditures of $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2002 included approximately $1.2 million
related to ongoing reconstruction of the Leverkusen, Germany sulfate plant.

38


-----

Our capital expenditures were $48.4 million, $26.7 million and $29.2 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Capital expenditures in 2001 include an aggregate of $22.3 million for the rebuilding of our
Leverkusen, Germany sulfate plant. We received $23.4 million of insurance proceeds for property damage
resulting from the Leverkusen fire and paid $3.2 million of expenses related to repairs and clean-up costs.
Capital expenditures in 1999 were higher compared with 2000 due to $6.0 million of expenditures for a
landfill expansion for our Belgian facility.

Our capital expenditures during the past three years include an aggregate of $22.0 million ($4.7 million
in 2001) for our ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs. Our estimated 2002 and 2003
capital expenditures are expected to be $28.5 million and $26.5 million, respectively, and include $3.8 million
and $3.6 million, respectively, in the area of environmental protection and compliance. Included in the 2002
capital expenditure estimate is $4.0 million to complete reconstruction of the Leverkusen, Germany sulfate
plant.

**_Financing cash flows_**

In 2001, we repaid 424 million ($21.4 million when paid), respectively, of our short-term bank debt with
excess cash flow from operations.

In 2000, we repaid 430.9 million ($28.9 million when paid) of our short-term debt with cash flow from
operations. Also, in December 2000, we borrowed $43 million of short-term non-U.S. dollar-denominated
bank debt and used the proceeds along with cash on hand to repay certain loans to affiliates.

In the first quarter of 1999, we prepaid the remaining balance of DM107 million ($60 million when
paid) of a term loan that was part of our previous DM bank credit facility, principally by drawing
DM100 million ($56 million when drawn) on the revolving portion of the DM credit facility. In the second
and third quarters of 1999, we repaid DM60 million ($33 million when paid) of the DM revolving credit
facility. The revolver’s outstanding balance of DM120 million was further reduced in October 1999 by
DM20 million ($11 million when paid). In December 1999, we borrowed $26 million of short-term
unsecured euro-denominated bank debt and used the proceeds along with cash on hand to prepay the
remaining balance of DM100 million ($52 million when paid) of the revolving portion of the DM credit
facility. The DM credit facility was then terminated, which released collateral and eliminated certain
restrictive loan covenants.

During 1999, we borrowed $52 million from an affiliate. During 2000 and the first three months of 2002,
we repaid $93 million and $25 million, respectively, of loans from affiliates (a portion of the 2000 repayment
was funded through new third-party borrowings discussed above). As discussed above under ‘‘Offering
Memorandum Summary — Certain Transactions and Refinancing,’’ we will repay a portion of our remaining
balance of loans from affiliates using the proceeds of this offering, and the remainder of our loans from
affiliates will be contributed to our equity upon completion of this offering.

Cash flows related to capital contributions and other transactions with affiliates aggregated a net cash
inflow of $11.6 million in 1999, a net cash outflow of $18.8 million in 2000, a net cash outflow of
$31.8 million in 2001, and a net cash inflow of $25 million in the first three months of 2002. Such amounts
relate principally to cash flows related to dividends or loans we received from, or capital contributions or
loans we made to, our former Canadian operations, or affiliates (such loans being reported as a reduction of
our stockholder’s equity, and therefore considered financing cash flows). As discussed above under ‘‘Offering
Memorandum Summary — Certain Transactions and Refinancing,’’ we transferred our Canadian operations to
Kronos in April 2002, and accordingly we will no longer report any such capital transaction cash flows
related to such Canadian operations subsequent to April 2002. Also as discussed above under ‘‘Offering
Memorandum Summary — Certain Transactions and Refinancing,’’ settlement of such notes receivable from
affiliates is not currently contemplated in the foreseeable future. Subsequent to completion of this offering, we
will transfer such notes receivable from affiliates to Kronos in one or more non-cash transactions, and
accordingly we will no longer report cash flows related to such notes receivable from affiliates.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

At March 31, 2002, we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating $42.5 million. Based upon our
expectations for the TiO2 industry and anticipated demands on our cash resources as discussed herein, we
expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations including operations, capital expenditures
and debt service. To the extent that actual developments differ from our expectations, our liquidity could be
adversely affected.

**_Income tax contingencies_**

Certain of our tax returns in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions are being examined and tax
authorities have proposed or may propose tax deficiencies, including penalties and interest. See note 13 to the
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

A reduction in the German ‘‘base’’ income tax rate from 30% to 25%, enacted in October 2000, became
effective January 1, 2001. The reduction in the German income tax rate resulted in $5.7 million of additional
deferred income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2000 due to a reduction of our deferred income tax
asset related to certain German tax attributes. We do not expect our future current income tax expense to be
affected by the rate change in Germany.

We received tax assessments from the Norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies, including
related interest, of NOK39.3 million pertaining to 1994 and 1996. We were unsuccessful in appealing the tax
assessments and in June 2001 paid NOK39.3 million ($4.3 million when paid) to the Norwegian tax
authorities. We were adequately reserved for this contingency. The lien on our Fredrikstad, Norway TiO2 plant
in favor of the Norwegian tax authorities has been released.

We have received preliminary tax assessments for the years 1991 to 1997 from the Belgian tax
authorities proposing tax deficiencies, including related interest, of approximately 410.4 million ($9.2 million
at December 31, 2001 and $9.1 million at March 31, 2002). We have filed protests against the assessments
for the years 1991 to 1997. We are in discussions with the Belgian tax authorities and believe that a
significant portion of the assessments is without merit.

No assurance can be given that our tax matters will be favorably resolved due to the inherent
uncertainties involved in court and tax proceedings. We believe that we have provided adequate accruals for
additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such examinations. We
further believe that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material adverse effect on
our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recognized a $23.2 million income tax benefit attributable to a
decrease in the valuation allowance due to a change in estimate of our ability to utilize certain German
income tax attributes that did not previously meet the ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ recognition criteria.

We recognized a $40 million noncash income tax benefit in 1999 comprised of a favorable resolution of
our tax contingency in Germany ($14 million) and a net reduction in our deferred income tax valuation
allowance due to a change in estimate of our ability to utilize certain income tax attributes under the
‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ recognition criteria ($26 million).

The $26 million net reduction in our deferred income tax valuation allowance in 1999 is comprised of
(i) a $50 million decrease in the valuation allowance to recognize the benefit of certain deductible income tax
attributes which we now believe meet the recognition criteria as a result of, among other things, a corporate
restructuring of our German subsidiaries offset by (ii) a $24 million increase in the valuation allowance to
reduce the previously recognized benefit of certain other deductible income tax attributes which we now
believe do not meet the recognition criteria due to a change in German tax law.

At December 31, 2001 and March 31, 2002, we had approximately $317 million and $312 million,
respectively, of income tax loss carryforwards in Germany with no expiration date. At December 31, 2001
and March 31, 2002, we had deferred tax valuation allowance totaling $121.7 million and $117.6 million,
respectively.

**_Redeemable preferred stock, profit participation certificates and notes receivable from affiliates_**

We had issued and outstanding Series A and Series B redeemable preferred stock and profit participation
certificates totalling $617.4 million and $690.9 million at December 31, 2001, and March 31, 2002,
respectively, including cumulative and unpaid dividends. The Series A redeemable preferred stock was issued
to Kronos in February 1999 as a result of a capital contribution to us through the reduction of our affiliate
notes payable to NL Industries and Kronos. The Series B redeemable preferred stock was issued to Kronos in
February 1999 as a result of a contribution of intellectual property by Kronos to us. The intellectual property
was contributed to us at Kronos’ carryover basis of zero due to common control of us and Kronos. The profit
participation certificates were issued to Kronos in December 1999 as part of a recapitalization. We had
$700.8 million and $674.7 million of outstanding notes receivable from affiliates at December 31, 2001 and
March 31, 2002, respectively. Settlement of such notes receivable is not currently contemplated in the
foreseeable future, and consequently such notes receivable from affiliates are reported in our consolidated
balance sheet as a reduction of our stockholder’s equity in accordance with GAAP. These notes arose
between us, NL Industries and Kronos through a series of transactions with affiliates, a substantial portion of
which were noncash in nature. We periodically convert accrued interest receivable from affiliates to notes
receivable from affiliates.

See ‘‘Certain Transactions and Refinancing,’’ ‘‘Capitalization’’ and notes 16 and 17 to the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Foreign operations_**

As discussed above, we have substantial operations located outside the United States for which the
functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. As a result, the reported amount of our assets and liabilities (and
income and expenses) related to our non-U.S. operations, and therefore our consolidated net assets will
fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates. At March 31, 2002, we had substantial net assets
denominated in the euro, Norwegian kroner and United Kingdom pound sterling.

**_Euro currency_**

Beginning January 1, 1999, certain members of the European Union (‘‘EU’’), including Germany,
Belgium, the Netherlands and France, adopted a new European currency unit (the ‘‘euro’’) as their common
legal currency. Following the introduction of the euro, the participating countries’ national currencies
remained legal tender as denominations of the euro from January 1, 1999 through January 1, 2002, and the
exchange rates between the euro and such national currency units were fixed. Beginning January 1, 2002,
national currency units were exchanged for euros and the euro became the primary legal tender currency.

We conduct substantial operations in Europe. As of January 1, 2001, the functional currency of our
German, Belgian, Dutch and French operations have been converted to the euro from their respective national
currencies.

**_New accounting principles not yet adopted_**

We will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (‘‘SFAS’’) No. 143, ‘‘Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,’’ no later than January 1, 2003. Under SFAS No. 143, the fair value of a liability for
an asset retirement obligation covered under the scope of SFAS No. 143 would be recognized in the period in
which the liability is incurred, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability would be accreted to its present value, and the capitalized cost would be
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity would either
settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement. We are still studying this
standard to determine, among other things, whether we have any asset retirement obligations which are
covered under the scope of SFAS No. 143, and the effect, if any, of the adoption has not yet been
determined.

**_Other_**

We periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, alternative uses of capital, capital needs and
availability of resources in view of, among other things, our debt service and capital expenditure requirements
and estimated future operating cash flows. As a result of this process, we in the past have sought, and in the
future may seek, to reduce, refinance, repurchase or restructure indebtedness; raise additional capital;
restructure ownership interests; sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets; or take a combination of such
steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources. In the normal course of our business, we
may review opportunities for acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or other business combinations in the
chemical or other industries. In the event of any acquisition or joint venture transaction, we may consider
using available cash, issuing equity securities or increasing our indebtedness to the extent permitted by the
agreements governing our existing debt. See note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**BUSINESS**

**General**

We are the second largest producer of TiO2 in Europe, with an estimated 18% share of European TiO2
sales volume. We are the leading producer and marketer of TiO2 in Germany, with an estimated 25% share of
sales volume in 2001, and are among the leading marketers of TiO2 in the Benelux and Scandinavian
markets. TiO2 is a pigment used to whiten, brighten and add opacity to thousands of commonly used
products, such as paints, plastics and paper, as well as fibers, rubber, ceramics, inks and cosmetics. There are
currently no effective substitutes for TiO2 for use in these applications. We market over 40 different TiO2
grades to over 4,000 customers in over 100 countries. We market our products through a dedicated sales force
in Europe and provide our customers with significant technical and application-related services. Our
predecessor companies were the first producers of TiO2 in the world, and we have achieved and maintained
our market position through our long-term customer relationships, our new product development efforts, our
commitment to product quality and by offering extensive technical and sales services.

We currently manufacture TiO2 in five plants in Europe (two in Leverkusen, Germany; one in
Nordenham, Germany; one in Langerbrugge, Belgium; and one in Fredrikstad, Norway), and sell and
distribute TiO2 from our plants and sales and distribution facilities located throughout Europe. Our plants are
currently capable of producing approximately 313,000 metric tons of TiO2 per year. Projected annual capacity
is expected to increase to approximately 328,000 metric tons in 2004 as a result of additional debottlenecking
that can be achieved through low cost capital investment.

**Products and Operations**

Some of the principal applications for our products include:

**_TiO2 for paints and coatings._** Our TiO2 is used to provide opacity, hiding power, durability, tinting
strength and brightness in industrial coatings, as well as for paints and coatings for home interiors and
exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings. The
amount of TiO2 used in paints and coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and quality desired.
Generally, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO2 content. Recent trends
toward white and pastel-colored surface coatings and extended warranties for appliances and other surface
coated consumer durable items have resulted in higher usage in some applications.

**_TiO2 for plastics._** We produce TiO2 pigments that improve the physical and optical properties in
plastics, including whiteness and opacity. TiO2 is used to provide opacity in items such as plastic grocery
bags, vinyl window and door profiles and vinyl siding, as well as in agricultural and packaging film to
provide opacity and allow the film to be printed for informational or advertising purposes. TiO2 also provides
hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and durability for housewares, appliances, toys, computer cases
and food packages. TiO2’s high brightness, along with its opacity, is used in some engineering plastics to
help mask their undesirable natural color.

**_TiO2 for paper._** Our TiO2 is used in the production of paper to provide whiteness, brightness, color
stability and opacity. TiO2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including filled paper, coated
paper and laminate (decorative) paper. In filled paper applications, TiO2 is added directly to the pulp and
becomes part of the sheet itself. TiO2 is particularly useful in filled paper applications because of its ability to
improve the physical appearance of paper without significant negative impact on other performance
characteristics as a result of the minimal quantities required. Without TiO2, high opacity, lightweight papers
could not be produced. TiO2 is used in paper coatings for production of high gloss papers. TiO2 is also used
in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together using melamine resin under high
temperature and pressure. The top layer of paper contains as much as 50% TiO2 and is the layer that is
printed with decorative patterns. Paper laminates are used to replace materials such as wood and tile for such
applications as counter tops, furniture and wallboard. TiO2 is beneficial in these applications because it assists
in preventing the material from fading or changing color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other
weathering agents.

43


-----

**_TiO2 for inks and textiles._** We produce TiO2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of printing inks.
TiO2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical requirements of
printing machinery, including speed and high temperatures. Our TiO2 is also used in textile applications. TiO2
functions as an opacifying, brightening and delustering agent. In manmade fibers such as rayon and polyester,
TiO2 corrects undesirable characteristics such as glossy and translucent appearance. Without the presence of
TiO2, these materials would be unsuitable for use in many textile applications.

**_TiO2 for other applications._** We produce high purity sulfate process anatase TiO2 used to provide
opacity, whiteness and brightness in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin cream,
lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste. Our TiO2 is also found in food products, such as candy and
confectionary, and in pet foods where it is used to obtain uniformity of color and appearance. In
pharmaceuticals, our TiO2 is used commonly as a colorant in pill and capsule coatings as well as in liquid
medicines to provide uniformity of color and appearance. Kronos purified anatase grades meet the applicable
requirements of the CTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP (United States
Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration).

TiO2 is produced in two crystalline forms: rutile and anatase. Rutile TiO2 is a more tightly bound crystal
that has a higher refractive index than anatase TiO2 and therefore better opacification and tinting strength in
many applications. Although many end-use applications can use either form of TiO2, rutile TiO2 is the
preferred form for use in certain coatings, plastics and ink applications. Anatase TiO2 has a bluer undertone
and is less abrasive than rutile TiO2, and it is often preferred for use in paper, ceramics, rubber and manmade fibers.

While we believe that currently there are no effective substitutes for TiO2 for use in the above
applications, extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used in a number
of our markets. Generally, extenders are used to reduce to some extent the use of higher-cost TiO2. The use
of extenders has not significantly changed TiO2 consumption over the past decade because, to date, extenders
generally have failed to match the performance characteristics of TiO2. As a result, we believe that the use of
extenders will not materially alter the growth of the TiO2 business in the foreseeable future.

We currently produce over 40 different TiO2 grades, sold under the KronosTM trademark, which provide a
variety of performance properties to meet customers’ specific requirements. Our major customers include
domestic and international paint, plastics and paper manufacturers.

We are also engaged in the mining and sale of ilmenite ore, a raw material used as a feedstock by
certain TiO2 plants. Our mining operations have an estimated annual production capacity of approximately
900,000 metric tons, and we have estimated ilmenite reserves of at least 20 years at the current rate of usage.
In 2001, we sold approximately 793,000 metric tons of ilmenite (699,000 metric tons in 2000), of which
243,000 metric tons were used internally in our sulfate-process TiO2 plants (304,000 metric tons in 2000) and
550,000 metric tons were sold to third-party customers (395,000 metric tons in 2000). The decrease in our
internal usage in 2001 was primarily due to a fire that occurred on March 20, 2001 that damaged a section of
our Leverkusen, Germany sulfate-process TiO2 plant and temporarily halted production at that plant.
Approximately 7% of our consolidated net sales in 2001 and 4% in 2000 represented ilmenite sales to
external customers.

In addition, we are engaged in the manufacture and sale of iron-based water treatment chemicals
worldwide (derived from co-products of pigment production processes). Our water treatment chemicals
(marketed under the name ecochemTM) are used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents
and municipal wastewater, and in the manufacture of iron pigments. Sales of water treatment chemicals were
5% of our revenue in both 2001 and 2000.

**The TiO2 Industry**

The global TiO2 industry is concentrated. We, along with our North American affiliates and our five
largest competitors (E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.; Millennium Chemicals, Inc.; Huntsman International
Holdings LLC; Kerr-McGee Corporation; and Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd.) account for approximately 80%

44


-----

of worldwide TiO2 production volume and approximately 86% of European TiO2 production volume. The
TiO2 industry has substantial requirements for entry, including proprietary production technology and
significant capital investment. Currently, total global capacity is approximately 4.4 million metric tons,
according to International Business Management Associates. Based upon current selling prices, the long lead
times required for planning, obtaining government approvals and construction and the fact that no new plants
are currently under construction, additional greenfield capacity is not expected in the next three to five years.
While we believe that current selling prices do not support new greenfield capacity, it is likely that producers
will continue to increase capacity over the next several years through incremental debottlenecking of existing
facilities. According to International Business Management Associates, prices of TiO2 are expected to be
positively impacted by limited investment in new capacity over the next three to five years.

TiO2 is considered a ‘‘quality-of-life’’ product with demand affected by underlying global
macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, consumer disposable income and population. According to
International Business Management Associates, since 1980, growth in TiO2 consumption has averaged 2.9%
per year and did not decline during any two consecutive years. Although short-term influences, such as
customer and producer stocking and destocking activities, may have distorted TiO2’s growth trend, over the
long-term, GDP growth has historically been the primary underlying factor influencing growth in TiO2
demand. Additionally, the TiO2 industry experiences some seasonality in its sales as paint sales generally
peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere, resulting in greater TiO2 sales
volume during the first half of the year. Per capita consumption of TiO2 in the United States and Western
Europe far exceeds that in other areas of the world and these regions are expected to continue to be the
largest consumers of TiO2. TiO2 demand in other regions of the world could increase as these economies
develop to the point that ‘‘quality-of-life’’ products using TiO2 become in greater demand.

The selling price of TiO2 is significantly affected by industry capacity and demand, with the last cyclical
peak for TiO2 prices having occurred in late 2000 and the highest peak pricing for TiO2 having occurred in
1990. Since late 2000 through early 2002, weak economic conditions worldwide have resulted in lower
customer purchasing. Accordingly, TiO2 producers reduced their operating rates, and the selling prices of
TiO2 declined. For example, our current TiO2 prices in billing currencies are approximately 8% below the
five-year average and approximately 25% below their historical high. Our average selling prices in billing
currencies in March 2002 were approximately 17% lower than prices in November 2000.

In the first quarter of 2002, all major producers announced price increases worldwide of 5% to 8% to be
implemented during the second quarter of 2002. During the period March 2002 through May 2002, TiO2 sales
volume increased 22% over the 2001 comparable period. We believe that this strong demand is primarily
attributable to improving economies and customers restocking their inventory levels ahead of the previously
announced price increases. Through May 2002, we have partially implemented the announced price increases,
with May 2002 prices in billing currencies up 2% over March 2002 prices. Also, in May 2002, we and other
major producers announced a second round of price increases for certain regions of the world, including
Europe. However, the extent, if any, to which price increases will be realized will depend on global market
conditions.

TiO2 is manufactured using either the chloride or sulfate production process. Although most end-use
applications can use pigments produced by either process, chloride process pigments are generally preferred
in certain coatings and plastics applications and sulfate process pigments are generally preferred for paper,
fibers and ceramics applications. Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of
TiO2 industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process
pigments. In general, the chloride process is less intensive than the sulfate process in terms of capital
investment, labor and energy. Approximately 60% of global production capacity (and approximately 62% of
our production capacity) is based on chloride process technology with the remainder thereof based upon the
sulfate process.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

**_Leading market positions._** We enjoy a leading market position in TiO2, which gives us an advantage
over many of our competitors. Our predecessor companies were the first TiO2 producers in the world and
have manufactured TiO2 for 86 years. We are the second largest producer of TiO2 in Europe and the largest in
Germany, which has the largest economy in Europe. We are also among the leading sellers of TiO2 in the
Scandinavian, Benelux, Austrian and Swiss markets. We have a global presence through our parent, Kronos,
which sells our products in North America. We believe that our strong presence in Western Europe
strategically positions us to take advantage of growth within the Eastern European markets.

**_Strong customer base._** Our experience in and commitment to the TiO2 industry are known by our
customers. We enjoy a high level of customer loyalty, which helps us maintain our leading market positions.
We have developed many long-term customer relationships through our broad product offerings, packaging
flexibility, strong technical support and customer service. We currently have over 4,000 customers, with the
top ten customers accounting for approximately 23% of our sales and no individual customer accounting for
more than 6% of our sales. We also collaborate with our customers to develop new TiO2 grades for key
applications.

**_Broad product range._** We have one of the broadest product offerings in the TiO2 industry. We supply
grades made via both the chloride and the sulfate processes. We offer over 40 different TiO2 grades, including
rutile, anatase and non-pigmentary grades, surface treated and non-surface treated grades and dry and paper
slurry grades. We offer a variety of packaging options to meet our customers’ needs, including 25 kilogram
plastic and paper bags, Intermediate Bulk Containers in various sizes, bulk deliveries of dry pigments to our
customers’ silos and slurried pigments to the paper industry. We use our product offering and packaging
flexibility to help differentiate ourselves from the competition.

**_High performance products._** We have several key grades within our product range that we believe have
superior performance characteristics. We supply the leading chloride grade used in the manufacture of PVC
profiles in Europe, which are used to construct window frames, doorframes, window shades and siding. This
grade, with over 30 years of proven performance, holds over 50% of the market for European PVC profiles.
Other applications where we believe we hold a performance advantage include chloride grades for paper
laminate applications and engineering plastics and sulfate grades for photographic films; purified anatase
grades for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics markets; and specialty anatase grades for the dry cell
battery, capacitor, textile and fiber markets. We believe that our customer relationships, the breadth of our
product offerings and the performance of our grades in several applications make it difficult for competitive
grades to win the favor of our customers.

**_Proprietary chloride production technology._** We are the leading European chloride process manufacturer, with annual chloride process capacity of approximately 194,000 metric tons using proprietary
technology. Certain of our customers, including many in the paint and plastics industries, generally prefer
chloride process pigments in part due to higher durability, high temperature tolerance and blue tone
characteristics. Proprietary production technology is also an important barrier to entry in the TiO2 industry, as
companies that possess such chloride technology are reluctant to license it to competitors. Through
debottlenecking, we have increased our chloride capacity by 40% since 1994, including a debottlenecking
project between 1996 and 1998 at our Leverkusen, Germany facility, which added 20,000 metric tons of
capacity. Approximately 62% of our product is produced with this technology, while only 22% of
competitors’ capacity in Europe utilizes the chloride process.

**_Experienced management team._** We are managed by an experienced and motivated group of senior
executive officers, with an average of 21 years of experience in the chemical industry. In addition to our
strong executive management team, we have an experienced group of operating managers who work to
maintain our strong TiO2 position.

**_Captive ilmenite ore mining operations._** Our captive mining operations provide us a reliable source of
TiO2 feedstock for our sulfate process production plants at reduced cost, providing 100% of the ore required

46


-----

for these plants. Nearly 40% of our mine’s production is used internally, and the balance is sold to other
pigment and titanium slag producers at competitive prices yielding profitable margins.

**Our Strategy**

Our strategy is to increase value by:

) maximizing our earnings, cash flows and return on capital employed by reducing costs, increasing
efficiencies and optimizing existing assets; and

) increasing our competitiveness by expanding our size and market presence through internal growth
initiatives and technology innovation.

Specifically, to meet our goals, we strive to:

**_Improve operating efficiencies and margins._** We believe that our operations are among the most
efficient in the industry. We continue to focus on increasing manufacturing efficiencies through selected
capital projects, process improvement and best practices, in order to lower unit costs and improve our
margins. Our research and development, including process technology, focuses on improving production
processes, yields and qualities. These operating efficiencies have been accomplished through aggressive
operator training, innovative technology changes and constant equipment improvements. For example, we
continue to improve our chloride plants’ on-stream efficiency, and we anticipate further maintenance cost
reductions by extending by 40% to 50% the time that the plants’ chlorinators are in use, yielding annual
maintenance savings of approximately $4 million. We also have a newly designed acid scrubber and newly
designed pigment bag filter, which are expected to add approximately nine additional production days per
year per line. This is equivalent to approximately 4,500 metric tons per year. Prudent personnel cost
reductions are a continuous effort, which over approximately the last six years have resulted in an
approximate 13% reduction in manufacturing and support staff personnel, yielding annual savings of
approximately $11 million. These cost reduction programs have resulted in a significant improvement in our
fixed cost structure during a time when our production capacity has increased over 20%, leading to a
significant improvement in our margins. We intend to continue to use our manufacturing expertise to lower
costs, improve efficiency and enhance the performance and reliability of our product line.

**_Grow through technology and innovation._** We continue to improve the consistency of our grades and
develop new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of our customers and increase
product life cycles. For example, we have enhanced our product consistency and added new grades for
plastics, coatings, fiber and paper laminate applications. Specifically, in plastics applications, one grade
targeted for the growing engineering plastic segment provides excellent masking of the natural yellowness of
engineering plastics at high temperatures. Two other plastic grades were designed for use in a range of
polyolefin plastic resin applications, as they impart a desirable blue undertone to these resins. We have also
developed a new paper laminate grade that we expect to introduce later this year designed to deliver higher
opacity in this fast growing market segment.

**_Debottleneck existing facilities._** Increasing our production capacity with only moderate capital outlays
continues to be a major goal. Without any new plant or new line construction, our production capacity has
increased 20% over the last six years and we believe that our capacity can reach approximately 328,000
metric tons during 2004 as a result of additional debottlenecking that can be achieved through low cost
capital investment.

**Manufacturing Process and Raw Materials**

We manufacture TiO2 using both the chloride process and the sulfate process. Approximately 62% of our
current production capacity is based on our chloride process, which generates less waste than the sulfate
process. The sulfate process is a batch chemical process that uses sulfuric acid to extract TiO2. Sulfate
technology normally produces either anatase or rutile pigment. The chloride process is a continuous process
that utilizes chlorine to extract rutile TiO2. In general, the chloride process is also less intensive than the
sulfate process in terms of capital investment, labor and energy. Because much of the chlorine is recycled and

47


-----

higher titanium-containing feedstock is used, the chloride process produces less waste. Once an intermediate
TiO2 pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process, it is ‘‘finished’’ into products with
specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications through proprietary processes involving
various chemical surface treatments and intensive milling and micronizing.

Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of TiO2 industry sales
represented by chloride-process pigments has increased relative to sulfate-process pigments and, in 2001,
chloride-process production facilities represented approximately 60% of global industry capacity.

A fire on March 20, 2001 damaged a section of our Leverkusen, Germany 35,000 metric ton sulfateprocess TiO2 plant and, as a result, production of TiO2 at the Leverkusen facility was temporarily halted. The
fire did not enter our adjacent chloride-process TiO2 plant, but did damage certain support equipment
necessary to operate that plant. The damage to the support equipment resulted in a temporary shutdown of
the chloride-process TiO2 plant. On April 8, 2001, repairs to the damaged support equipment were
substantially completed and full production resumed at the chloride-process TiO2 plant. The sulfate-process
TiO2 plant became approximately 50% operational in September 2001 and became fully operational in late
October 2001. The damages to property and the business interruption losses caused by the fire were covered
by insurance. See ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Results of Operations’’ and note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum.

We produced 72,000 metric tons of TiO2 in each of the quarters ended March 31, 2001 and 2002. We
produced 269,000 metric tons of TiO2 in 2001, compared to a record 297,000 metric tons produced in 2000
and 272,000 metric tons in 1999. Our average production capacity utilization rate in 2001 was down from
near full capacity in 2000, primarily due to lost production volume resulting from the Leverkusen fire and our
decision to curtail production in the fourth quarter of 2001 as demand remained soft. We believe that our
current annual attainable production capacity is approximately 313,000 metric tons. We expect that with low
cost capital investment, our production capacity will be increased by approximately 12,000 metric tons
primarily at our chloride facilities and 3,000 metric tons at our sulfate facilities, bringing our capacity to
approximately 328,000 metric tons during 2004.

The primary raw materials used in the TiO2 chloride production process are titanium-containing
feedstock derived from beach sand ilmenite, natural rutile ore, chlorine and coke. Chlorine and coke are
available from a number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is
available from a limited number of suppliers around the world, principally located in Australia, South Africa,
Canada, India and the United States.

Through our affiliates we purchase slag refined from ilmenite sand from Richards Bay Iron and Titanium
(Proprietary) Limited (South Africa), a 51%-owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto plc (U.K.), under a long-term
supply contract that expires at the end of 2006. Natural rutile ore is purchased by our affiliates primarily from
Iluka Resources, Limited (Australia), a company formed through the merger of Westralian Sands Limited
(Australia) and RGC Mineral Sands, Ltd., under a long-term supply contract that expires at the end of 2004.
We, through our affiliates, do not expect to encounter difficulties obtaining long-term extensions to existing
supply contracts or replacement contracts prior to the expiration of the contracts. We expect to meet our
chloride feedstock requirements over the next several years from raw materials purchased under these
contracts and extensions thereof.

The primary raw materials used in the TiO2 sulfate production process are titanium-containing feedstock
derived primarily from rock and beach sand ilmenite and sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is available from a
number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a
limited number of suppliers around the world. Currently, the principal active sources are located in Norway,
Canada, Australia, India and South Africa. Ore from our ilmenite mine is expected to supply all or
substantially all of our sulfate-process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future.

We believe that the availability of titanium-containing feedstock for both the chloride and sulfate
processes is adequate for the next several years. We do not expect to experience any interruptions of our raw

48


-----

material supplies because of our long-term supply contracts. However, political and economic instability in
certain countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect the availability of
feedstock. Any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations or cash flows. See ‘‘Risk Factors — We have
a limited number of suppliers for some our raw materials, which could negatively affect us.’’

**Organization and Relationship with Our Parent Company**

We conduct our operations primarily through our principal wholly-owned subsidiaries, Kronos Germany,
Kronos Belgium, Kronos Norway, Kronos UK and Kronos Denmark, and our 94%-owned subsidiary, Kronos
France. We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kronos, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NL
Industries, the world’s fifth largest producer of TiO2. Kronos conducts its North American operations through
its principal wholly-owned subsidiaries, Kronos Louisiana, Kronos USA and Kronos Canada (collectively,
‘‘Kronos’ North American Subsidiaries’’).

NL Industries is a New Jersey corporation incorporated in 1891. The common stock of NL Industries is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. and NL Industries files annual, quarterly and current reports,
proxy statements and other information with the Commission. We were formed in 1988; and our principal
subsidiaries, Kronos Germany, Kronos Belgium and Kronos Norway, were initially formed in 1927, 1954 and
1916, respectively. Kronos’ North American Subsidiaries process and sell TiO2 in North America, and we and
our subsidiaries sell TiO2 in North America through Kronos’ North American Subsidiaries pursuant to certain
buy/sell agreements described below under ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.’’ Kronos’ North
American Subsidiaries also sell TiO2 in Europe through us and our subsidiaries pursuant to such agreements.
We and our subsidiaries are also parties to other intercorporate agreements with NL Industries and its
affiliates, which agreements are described below under ‘‘Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.’’

**Competition**

The global markets in which we operate our business are highly competitive. Competition is based on a
number of factors, such as price, product quality and service. Although certain TiO2 grades are considered
specialty pigments, the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered
commodity pigments with price generally being the most significant competitive factor. We are the second
largest producer of TiO2 in Europe, the leading producer and marketer of TiO2 in Germany and among the
leading marketers of TiO2 in the Benelux and Scandinavian markets. See ‘‘Risk Factors — We sell our
products in a mature and highly competitive industry and face price pressure in the markets in which we
operate.’’

Our principal competitors in Europe are E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.; Millennium Chemicals, Inc.;
Huntsman International Holdings LLC; Kerr-McGee Corporation; and Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd. Our five
largest competitors have estimated individual shares of worldwide TiO2 production capacity ranging from 23%
to 5%, and, together with us and the Kronos North American Subsidiaries, an estimated aggregate 80% share
of worldwide TiO2 production volume. Huntsman International Holdings LLC is the largest producer in
Europe.

Capacity additions through construction of greenfield plants in the worldwide TiO2 market require
significant capital investment and substantial lead time, typically three to five years. No greenfield plants are
currently under construction, but industry capacity can be expected to increase as we and our competitors
debottleneck existing plants. In addition to potential capacity additions, certain competitors have announced
that they have either idled or shut down facilities.

No assurance can be given that future increases in TiO2 industry production capacity and future average
annual demand growth rates for TiO2 will conform to our expectations. If actual developments differ from our
expectations, our and the TiO2 industry’s performance could be unfavorably affected.

-----

**Research and Development**

Our expenditures for research and development and certain technical support programs have averaged
approximately $6 million annually during the past three years. Research and development activities are
conducted principally at our Leverkusen, Germany facility. Such activities are directed primarily toward
improving both the chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening
our competitive position by developing new pigment applications.

**Patents and Trademarks**

We believe that patents held for products and production processes are important to us and to our
continuing business activities. We and our affiliates continually seek patent protection for our technical
developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe, and from time to time enter into licensing
arrangements with third parties.

There can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or
rendered unenforceable. See ‘‘Risk Factors — If our patents are declared invalid or our trade secrets become
known to our competitors, our ability to compete may be adversely affected.’’

Our major trademarks, including KronosTM and ecochemTM, are protected by registration in Europe, the
United States and elsewhere with respect to the products we manufacture and sell.

**Operations**

We have operated in European markets since the 1920s. Our current production capacity is located in
Europe with our net property and equipment aggregating $265 million at March 31, 2002. Our European
operations include production facilities in Germany, Belgium and Norway. Approximately $425 million of our
2001 consolidated sales were to European customers and approximately $130 million of our 2001
consolidated sales were to customers in areas other than Europe. Sales to customers in the U.S. through
Kronos’ North American Subsidiaries pursuant to buy/sell agreements aggregated $32 million in 2001. Our
operations are subject to, among other things, currency exchange rate fluctuations and our results of
operations have, in the past, been both favorably and unfavorably affected by fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations are discussed in
‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.’’

Our manufacturing and mining operations are also subject to extensive and diverse environmental
regulation in each of the foreign countries in which we operate. See ‘‘Regulatory and Environmental
Matters’’ below and ‘‘Risk Factors — We are subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may
result in unanticipated costs or liabilities.’’ In addition, political and economic uncertainties in certain of the
countries in which we operate may expose us to risk of loss.

**Customer Base and Seasonality**

We believe that neither our aggregate sales nor those of any of our principal product groups are
concentrated in or materially dependent upon any single customer or small group of customers. Our ten
largest customers accounted for approximately 23% of net sales in 2001. Neither our business as a whole nor
that of any of our principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent. Due in part to the increase in
paint production in the spring to meet the spring and summer painting season demand, TiO2 sales are
generally higher in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year.

**Employees**

As of March 31, 2002, we had approximately 1,950 employees, with approximately 1,200, 300 and 430
employees in Germany, Belgium and Norway, respectively, and approximately 20 employees elsewhere in
Europe. Hourly employees in production facilities worldwide are represented by a variety of labor unions,
with labor agreements having various expiration dates. We believe that our labor relations are good.

50


-----

**Regulatory and Environmental Matters**

Certain of our businesses are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture or use of substances
or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental
laws. As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of our past and current operations and
products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage. We have implemented and continue to
implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks. Our policy is to maintain
compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all of our facilities and to strive to improve
our environmental performance. It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements of
environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder, revisions of existing permits or discovery of
previously unknown conditions, could adversely affect our production, handling, use, storage, transportation,
sale or disposal of such substances as well as our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

Our production facilities operate in an environmental regulatory framework in which governmental
authorities typically are granted broad discretionary powers that allow them to issue operating permits
required for the plants to operate. We believe that all of our plants are in substantial compliance with such
permits and other applicable environmental requirements.

Although the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in Europe vary from country to country, a
common regulatory base is provided by the European Union (the ‘‘EU’’). Germany and Belgium are
members of the EU and follow its initiatives. Norway, although not a member, generally patterns its
environmental regulatory actions after the EU. We believe that we have all required permits and are in
substantial compliance with applicable EU requirements, including EU Directive 92/112/EEC regarding
establishment of procedures for reduction and eventual elimination of pollution caused by waste from the
TiO2 industry.

At all of our plant facilities other than Fredrikstad, Norway, we recycle our spent acid wastes either
through contracts with third parties or using our own facilities to provide sulfuric acid for our operations. We
have a contract with a third party to treat spent acid wastes of our German sulfate-process plants. With regard
to our Nordenham, Germany plant, either party may terminate the contract after giving four years advance
notice. Under certain circumstances, we may terminate the contract after giving six months notice, with
respect to treatment of effluents from the Leverkusen, Germany plant.

We landfill waste we generate at our Nordenham, Germany and Langerbrugge, Belgium plants, and mine
tailings waste generated at our facility in Norway. We maintain reserves, as required under GAAP, to cover
the anticipated cost of closure of these landfills, which were approximately $0.4 million as of March 31,
2002. These requirements for our landfills are expected to increase in the future in view of recently adopted
EU requirements.

We are also responsible for certain closure costs at landfills used and formerly used by our Leverkusen,
Germany sulfate process plant. We have a reserve of approximately $5 million related to such landfills.

Our capital expenditures related to our ongoing environmental protection and improvement programs
were approximately $4.7 million in 2001, and are currently expected to be approximately $3.8 million in 2002
and $3.6 million in 2003.

**Principal Shareholders**

We are a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kronos, which, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NL
Industries. At March 31, 2002, Valhi, Inc. and Tremont Corporation, each of which is an affiliate of Contran
Corporation, held approximately 62% and 21%, respectively, of NL Industries’ outstanding common stock. At
March 31, 2002, Contran Corporation and its subsidiaries held approximately 94% of Valhi, Inc.’s outstanding
common stock, and a company 80% owned by Valhi, Inc. and 20% owned by NL Industries held
approximately 80% of Tremont Corporation’s outstanding common stock. Substantially all of Contran
Corporation’s outstanding voting stock is held by trusts established for the benefit of certain children and
grandchildren of Harold C. Simmons, of which Mr. Simmons is the sole trustee. Mr. Simmons, the Chairman

51


-----

of the Board of NL Industries, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Contran Corporation
and Valhi, Inc. and a director of Tremont Corporation, may be deemed to control each of such companies.
For a discussion of potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with our ownership structure,
see ‘‘Risk Factors — Kronos and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest with us, and these conflicts could
adversely affect our business.’’

**Properties**

We currently operate five TiO2 plants in Europe (two in Leverkusen, Germany; one in Nordenham,
Germany; one in Langerbrugge, Belgium; and one in Fredrikstad, Norway). Our principal German operating
subsidiary leases the land under our Leverkusen TiO2 production facility pursuant to a lease expiring in 2050.
The Leverkusen facility, with about 50% of our current TiO2 production capacity, is located within an
extensive manufacturing complex owned by Bayer AG. Rent for the Leverkusen facility is established by
agreement with Bayer AG to be an amount agreed to be reasonable by the parties for periods of at least two
years at a time. Under a separate supplies and services agreement expiring in 2011, Bayer provides some raw
materials including chlorine and sulfuric acid, auxiliary and operating materials and utilities services
necessary to operate the Leverkusen facility. Currently, both the lease and the supplies and services
agreement have certain restrictions regarding our ability to transfer ownership or use of the Leverkusen
facility.

All of our principal production facilities described above are owned, except for the land under the
Leverkusen facility. We have a governmental concession with an unlimited term to operate our ilmenite mine
in Norway.

We lease corporate and administrative offices located in Leverkusen, Germany and Brussels, Belgium as
well as various sales offices located in France, the Netherlands, Denmark and the U.K.

**Legal Proceedings**

Kronos Belgium and various of its employees are the subject of an investigation by Belgian authorities
relating to an accident resulting in two fatalities that occurred in our Langerbrugge, Belgium facility in
October 2000. The initial stage of this investigation, which could ultimately result in civil and criminal
sanctions against Kronos Belgium, has been completed. It is anticipated that this matter will continue in the
investigative phase until the end of 2002 or early 2003. We are also involved in various other claims and
disputes incidental to our business. While the resolution of the matters described in this paragraph cannot be
predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

(1) Each of Dr. Wigdor and Mr. Hardy is also an executive officer of NL Industries and Kronos and divides his business time among us
and NL Industries and other affiliates of NL Industries. As an executive officer of NL Industries, each of Dr. Wigdor and Mr. Hardy
receives salary, bonus and other compensation from NL Industries. Dr. Wigdor and Mr. Hardy are generally not compensated directly
by us or our subsidiaries. For the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, no portion of Dr. Wigdor’s and Mr. Hardy’s salary was allocated to
us. Beginning in 2002, a portion of Dr. Wigdor’s and Mr. Hardy’s salary will be charged to us based on business time devoted.

(2) Represents options to purchase shares of common stock of NL Industries. None of these options for Dr. Wigdor or Mr. Hardy were
charged to us, nor do we expect that any such options will be charged to us in the future. We are charged by NL Industries for
options exercised by Dr. Fiand, Dr. Basson and Mr. Roth based upon the market price of NL Industries common stock at the date of
exercise.

(3) Represents amounts paid by NL Industries and allocated to us.

**Stock Option Grants**

The following table provides information with respect to the individual stock option grants to purchase
shares of common stock of NL Industries made to the persons named in the summary compensation table

(1) Options vest over five years from the date of grant at a rate of 40% on the second anniversary of the date of grant and 20% on each
of the next three succeeding anniversary dates. Options expire on the tenth anniversary date of the date of grant.

(2) The exercise price is equal to the mean of the high and low prices of NL Industries’ common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Tape on the date of grant.

(3) Pursuant to the rules of the Commission, these amounts reflect the calculations at assumed 5% and 10% annual appreciation rates.
Such calculations are not intended to forecast future appreciation, if any, and do not necessarily reflect the actual value, if any, that
may be realized. The actual value of such options, if any, would be realized only upon the exercise of such options and depends
upon the future performance of NL Industries’ common stock. No assurance can be made that the amounts reflected in these
columns will be achieved. The potential realizable value was computed as the difference between the appreciated value (at the end of
the ten-year term of the options) of NL Industries common stock into which these options are exercisable and the aggregate exercise
price of these options. The appreciated value per share at the end of the ten-year term would be $32.76 and $52.16 at the assumed
5% and 10% rates, respectively, with respect to these options.

**Stock Option Exercises and Holdings**

The following table provides information with respect to the persons named in the summary
compensation table concerning the exercise of options during 2001 and the value of unexercised options held
as of December 31, 2001. The options described in the following table are options to purchase shares of
common stock of NL Industries pursuant to the Incentive Plan. No stock appreciation rights were granted
during 2001.

The following table provides information with respect to estimated annual benefits payable upon
retirement under The Kronos, Inc. (Belgium) Group Insurance Plan (the ‘‘Pension Plan’’), which provides
lifetime retirement benefits to eligible employees of Kronos in Belgium. Dr. Basson is the only named
executive officer covered by the Pension Plan.

Under the Pension Plan, each employee contributes 1% of 13.9 times his or her gross monthly salary up
to the social security wage base plus 5% of any salary in excess of this amount. The Pension Plan provides a
benefit equal to (a) 70% or the average of such participant’s annual salary (including additional vacation pay
and bonus) over the last three full years immediately preceding retirement, less such participant’s single
person basic social security benefit, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is such participant’s
years of service up to 35 years and the denominator of which is 35. Benefits are payable upon retirement and
the attainment of ages specified in Pension Plan. Dr. Basson has an estimated 9.75 years of service credited
under the Pension Plan. Benefits under the Pension Plan are computed as an annual straight life annuity. The
benefits listed in the pension plan table set forth above are net of basic social security benefits.

Dr. Fiand and Mr. Roth are eligible to receive their pension through Kronos Germany through the Bayer
Pensionskasse and the Supplemental Pension Promise. All of our employees in Germany (including wage
earners) who have contributed for five years and are less than 55 years of age are covered by the Bayer
Pensionskasse. Each employee contributes 2% of eligible earnings excluding bonus, up to the social security
contribution ceiling (currently 454,000) and the Bayer Pensionskasse provides a benefit of 44% of such
employee’s accumulated contributions (with a minimum benefit of approximately 413 per month). All of our

56


-----

employees in Germany who have completed 10 years of service are also covered by the Supplemental Pension
Promise. Kronos Germany accrues 11.25% of participants’ eligible annual earnings excluding bonus in excess
of the social security contribution ceiling, up to a maximum of 498,500. The Supplemental Pension Promise
provides an annual retirement benefit of 20% of all accruals made by Kronos Germany. Benefits for both
plans are payable upon retirement and the attainment of ages specified in the plans. No amounts were paid or
distributed under these plans to Dr. Fiand or Mr. Roth in 2001. The estimated accrued annual benefits
payable upon normal retirement at normal retirement age for Dr. Fiand and Mr. Roth are 423,440 and
430,431, respectively.

**Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation**

Compensation for the named executive officers is set by the management development and compensation
committee of the board of directors of NL Industries. None of the named executive officers served on this
committee during 2001.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS**

As discussed above under ‘‘Business — Principal Shareholders,’’ we may be deemed to be controlled by
Harold C. Simmons. It is our policy to engage in transactions with related parties on terms, in our opinion,
no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unrelated parties. See note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The Indenture governing the notes offered hereby contains certain restrictions on our ability to enter into
transactions with affiliates. See ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’

We share certain services and resources with Kronos and NL Industries, and we rely on Kronos to
supply some of our raw materials and to purchase a portion of our products.

Certain of our sales are made to Kronos’ North American Subsidiaries. Such sales, consisting primarily
of TiO2, were $39 million in 2001, $54 million in 2000 and $57 million in 1999, and were $18 million in the
first three months of 2002 and $13 million in the first three months of 2001. The transfer price for such TiO2
sales is an amount equal to 95% of the North American trade price less certain selling expenses and
approximates the selling price that would have been paid if the same product had been sold to our third-party
distributors.

We purchase a nominal amount of TiO2 from Kronos’ North American Subsidiaries. Such purchases
were $1 million in 2001, $7 million in 2000 and $5 million in 1999, and were nil in the first three months of
2002 and $1 million in the first three months of 2001. The transfer price for such TiO2 purchases are
determined in a manner similar to our sales of TiO2 to affiliates.

We purchase rutile feedstock used as a raw material in all of our chloride process TiO2 facilities from
Kronos USA for use in our facilities for an amount equal to the amount paid by Kronos to the third-party
supplier plus a 2.5% administrative fee. Such feedstock purchases were $92 million in 2001, $89 million in
2000 and $88 million in 1999, and were $23 million in the first three months of 2002 and $18 million in the
first three months of 2001.

We own certain technology and trademarks used in our TiO2 business. We have granted a perpetual
license to Kronos’ North American Subsidiaries to use such technology and trademarks in their TiO2
operations. Such license is royalty-free other than with respect to Kronos Canada, from which we receive a
royalty based upon specified percentages of sales generated by Kronos Canada. Royalty income from Kronos
Canada was $5 million in 2001, $6 million in each of 2000 and 1999, and was $1 million in each of the first
three months of 2002 and 2001.

Kronos’ North American Subsidiaries and certain other affiliates provide certain management, financial,
tax planning, risk management and other administrative services to us on a fee basis. Such charges are based
upon estimates of the time devoted by the employees of the provider of the services to our affairs, and the
compensation of such persons. Because of the number of companies affiliated with NL Industries, we believe
that we benefit from cost savings and economies of scale gained by not having certain management, financial
and administrative staffs duplicated at each entity, thus allowing certain individuals to provide services to
multiple companies but only be compensated by one entity. Management fees we paid pursuant to these
agreements were $0.2 million in each of 2001 and 2000, $0.7 million in 1999, and were $0.3 million in the
first three months of 2002 and $0.1 million in the first three months of 2001. In addition, Dr. Wigdor and
Mr. Hardy, each of whom is one of our officers, are also officers of NL Industries and Kronos. From time to
time, our employees may also provide certain engineering services to Kronos’ Canadian operations for which
we are compensated based on a time-and-materials basis. The amount received for providing such services
has not been material.

We and Kronos are both members of NL Industries’ consolidated U.S. federal income tax group. As
such, we are a party to an income tax sharing agreement with Kronos. Effective January 1, 2001, the NL
Industries tax group, including us, are included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax group of Contran.
As a member of the Contran tax group, NL Industries is a party to a separate tax sharing agreement with
Valhi. NL Industries’ tax sharing agreement with Valhi provides that NL Industries calculate its liability for

58


-----

U.S. income taxes on a separate-company basis using the tax elections made by Contran. During 2002, our
tax sharing agreement with Kronos was amended pursuant to which our liability for U.S. income taxes is
computed on a separate-company basis using tax elections consistent with Kronos’ tax elections. We will
make distributions to or receive contributions from Kronos in the amounts we would have paid to or received
from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service had we not been a member of the NL Industries tax group, but rather
a separate taxpayer. Any contribution we would receive from Kronos under the amended tax sharing
agreement is limited to amounts we previously paid to Kronos under such agreement. We have never paid any
distributions to Kronos nor have we received any contributions from Kronos under our tax sharing agreement
with them. We would not have reported a different provision for income taxes in 1999, 2000 and 2001 if the
provision for income taxes in such periods had been computed in accordance with the tax allocation policy
contained in our amended tax sharing agreement with Kronos. See note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

We have certain indebtedness owed to NL Industries and its affiliates. Such indebtedness is discussed in
note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Interest
expense on such indebtedness was $34 million in 2001, $29 million in 2000 and $30 million in 1999, and
was $10 million in the first three months of 2002 and $6 million in the first three months of 2001. All of this
indebtedness either will be repaid with the proceeds from our sale of notes or contributed to our equity upon
completion of our sale of the notes.

We are party to master global Contran and NL Industries insurance coverage policies with regard to
property, business interruption, excess liability and other coverages. The costs associated with these policies
aggregated $7.1 million, $3.1 million and $2.9 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

The amounts receivable from and payable to affiliates are summarized in note 15 to the consolidated
financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**DESCRIPTION OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES’ NEW CREDIT FACILITY**

We anticipate that two subsidiaries of Kronos Norway (Kronos Titan A/S and Titania A/S), Kronos
Germany and Kronos Belgium (collectively the ‘‘Bank Borrowers’’) will enter into a new senior secured
credit facility (the ‘‘New Credit Facility’’) with a syndicate of banks led by Deutsche Bank AG. The
documentation for the New Credit Facility has not yet been negotiated, and the final documentation may
contain provisions more or less restrictive than those set forth below. As such, all information relating to the
New Credit Facility is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the documents anticipated
to be entered into in connection with the New Credit Facility.

**General**

We expect the New Credit Facility to provide for up to 480 million in revolving credit loans available to
refinance our outstanding indebtedness and provide for our ongoing operating needs. Upon the closing of the
New Credit Facility and after the initial expected borrowing under the New Credit Facility, we expect that the
Bank Borrowers will have approximately 440 million available for additional borrowing under that facility.
The New Credit Facility is expected to replace existing bank arrangements in place, and is expected to mature
in three years.

**Guarantees; Security**

We expect that the Bank Borrowers will be subject to covenants under the New Credit Facility, as will
certain current and future subsidiaries, if any. We also expect that Kronos Germany and Kronos Belgium will
guarantee all outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility is expected to
be secured by the working capital assets of the four co-borrowers and a pledge of the shares of Kronos
Norway.

**Interest; Fees**

We expect that interest under the New Credit Facility will be payable at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR plus the applicable margin spread. Unused commitment fees will be due quarterly. We anticipate
that the applicable margin spread will range between 175 basis points and 200 basis points, depending upon
facility usage. Undrawn commitment fees are expected to be 75 basis points per annum.

**Conditions to Funding**

Borrowing under the New Credit Facility will be conditioned upon the issuance of the notes offered
hereby, the repayment of certain outstanding bank loans, and other customary closing conditions.

**Conditions and Events of Default**

The New Credit Facility will contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for agreements of this
type, including, among others, covenants restricting our ability to (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) create
liens on our assets, (iii) make certain investments and loans, (iv) consolidate, merge or sell assets and
(v) change the character of our business.

We also expect to be required to comply with certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios.
These financial tests and ratios are expected to include requirements to maintain (i) a maximum leverage ratio
and (ii) a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the loan documentation).

The New Credit Facility will also include customary events of default. Events of default under the New
Credit Facility will include non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of
representations and warranties in any material respect, bankruptcy and insolvency events, cross-defaults and a
default in the event of a change of control (as defined). An event of default under the facility will permit the
lenders to accelerate the maturity of indebtedness under the facility, and may result in cross-defaults under
other indebtedness of us or our subsidiaries.

-----

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture (the ‘‘Indenture’’) between itself and The Bank of
New York, as Trustee (the ‘‘Trustee’’). The following is a summary of the material provisions of the
Indenture. It does not include all of the provisions of the Indenture. We urge you to read the Indenture
because it defines your rights. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made
part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the ‘‘TIA’’). A copy of
the Indenture may be obtained from the Company or the initial purchasers. You can find definitions of certain
capitalized terms used in this description under ‘‘— Certain Definitions.’’ For purposes of this section,
references to the ‘‘Company’’ include only KII and not its Subsidiaries and ‘‘Notes’’ shall include the
exchange notes to be issued pursuant to the exchange offer described in the ‘‘Exchange Offer; Registration
Rights’’ section.

The Notes will be senior obligations of the Company, ranking equally in right of payment with all our
other senior indebtedness. The Notes will be secured by a senior Lien on 65% of the Capital Stock of each of
the first-tier operating Subsidiaries of the Company.

The Company will issue the Notes in fully registered form in denominations of 41,000 and integral
multiples thereof. The Trustee will initially act as Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes. The Notes may
be presented for registration or transfer and exchange at the offices of the Registrar. The Company may
change any Paying Agent and Registrar without notice to holders of the Notes (the ‘‘Holders’’). The
Company will pay principal (and premium, if any) on the Notes at the Trustee’s corporate office in New
York. At the Company’s option, interest may be paid at the Trustee’s corporate trust office or by check
mailed to the registered address of Holders. So long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, the Company will maintain a special agent or, as the case may be, a paying and transfer agent in
Luxembourg. Any Notes that remain outstanding after the completion of the Exchange Offer, together with
the Exchange Notes issued in connection with the Exchange Offer, will be treated as a single class of
securities under the Indenture.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

An aggregate principal amount of 4270 million of Notes will be issued in the offering. The Notes will
mature on, 2009. Additional Notes may be issued from time to time, subject to the limitations set
forth under ‘‘— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness.’’ Interest on the
Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable semiannually in cash on each
and commencing on, 2002, to the persons who are registered Holders at the
close of business on the and immediately preceding the applicable interest payment date.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest
has been paid, from and including the date of issuance.

The Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of any mandatory sinking fund.

**Redemption**

_Optional Redemption._ Except as described below, the Notes are not redeemable before, 2005
(3.5 years after the Issue Date). Thereafter, the Company may redeem the Notes at its option, in whole or in
part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as
percentages of the principal amount thereof) if redeemed during the twelve-month period (or, in the case of

61


-----

the period commencing on, 2007, six-month period) commencing on of the year set forth
below:

**Year** **Percentage**

2005 ******************************************************************** %
2006 ******************************************************************** %
2007 ******************************************************************** %
2008 and thereafter ******************************************************** 100.000%

In addition, the Company must pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed.

_Optional Redemption upon Public Equity Offerings._ At any time, or from time to time, on or prior to
, 2005, the Company may, at its option, use the net cash proceeds of one or more Public Equity
Offerings (as defined below) to redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of the Notes issued under the
Indenture at a redemption price of % of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to the date of redemption; provided that:

(1) at least 65% of the principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture remains outstanding
immediately after any such redemption; and

(2) the Company makes such redemption not more than 90 days after the consummation of any
such Public Equity Offering.

‘‘Public Equity Offering’’ means an underwritten public offering of Qualified Capital Stock of the
Company, Kronos or NL Industries pursuant to a registration statement filed with the Commission in
accordance with the Securities Act (or pursuant to a similar or reasonably equivalent process in the European
Union or in any one or more states that are members of the European Union as of the Issue Date or in
Norway); provided that, in the event of a Public Equity Offering by Kronos or NL Industries, such issuer
directly or indirectly contributes to the equity capital of the Company the portion of the net cash proceeds of
such Public Equity Offering necessary to pay the aggregate redemption price (plus accrued interest to the date
of redemption) of the Notes to be redeemed pursuant to the preceding paragraph.

_Optional Redemption upon a Change of Control._ At any time on or prior to, 2005, the Notes
may also be redeemed or purchased (by the Company or any other Person) in whole but not in part, at the
Company’s option, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, the date of
redemption or purchase (the ‘‘Redemption Date’’) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). Such redemption or purchase may
be made upon notice mailed by first-class mail to each Holder’s registered address, not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (but in no event shall such notice be mailed more than 180 days
after the occurrence of such Change of Control). The Company may provide in such notice that payment of
such price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption or purchase may
be performed by another Person. Any such notice may be given prior to the occurrence of the related Change
of Control, and any such redemption, purchase or notice may, at the Company’s discretion, be subject to the
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including but not limited to the occurrence of the related
Change of Control.

‘‘Applicable Premium’’ means, with respect to a Note at any Redemption Date, the greater of (i) 1.0%
of the principal amount of such Note and (ii) the excess of (A) the present value at such Redemption Date of
(1) the redemption price of such Note on, 2005 (such redemption price being that described in the
first paragraph of this ‘‘Redemption’’ section) plus (2) all required remaining scheduled interest payments due
on such Note through, 2005, computed using a discount rate equal to the Adjusted Bund Rate, over
(B) the principal amount of such Note on such Redemption Date. Calculation of the Applicable Premium will
be made by the Company or on behalf of the Company by such Person as the Company shall designate;
_provided, however, that such calculation shall not be a duty or obligation of the Trustee._

62


-----

‘‘Adjusted Bund Rate’’ means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the mid-market yield, under the
heading which represents the average for the immediately prior week, appearing on Reuters page
AABBUND01, or its successor, for the maturity corresponding to, 2009 (if no maturity date is
within three months before or after, 2009, yields for the two published maturities most closely
corresponding to, 2009 shall be determined and the Bund yield shall be interpolated or
extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), plus 0.50%. The Bund
Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.

**Selection and Notice of Redemption**

In the event that the Company chooses to redeem less than all of the Notes, selection of the Notes for
redemption will be made by the Trustee either:

(1) in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on
which the Notes are listed; or

(2) on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate.

No Notes of a principal amount of 41,000 or less shall be redeemed in part. If a partial redemption is
made with the proceeds of a Public Equity Offering, the Trustee will select the Notes only on a pro rata basis
or on as nearly a pro rata basis as is practicable (subject to the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream
Luxembourg). Notice of redemption will be mailed by first-class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days
before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. In the event
Notes are to be redeemed, the Company will also publish a notice of redemption in accordance with the
procedures described under ‘‘— Notices.’’ On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on
Notes or portions thereof called for redemption as long as the Company has deposited with the Paying Agent
funds in satisfaction of the applicable redemption price.

**Holding Company Structure**

The Company’s assets consist primarily of investments in its operating Subsidiaries. The Company’s cash
flow and its ability to service Indebtedness, including the Company’s ability to pay the interest on and
principal of the Notes, depends upon the distribution of the earnings of its Subsidiaries, whether in the form
of dividends, partnership distributions, advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations, to
service its debt obligations. In addition, the claims of the Holders are subject to the prior payment of all
liabilities (whether or not for borrowed money) and to any preferred stock interest of such Subsidiaries of the
Company. There can be no assurance that, after providing for all prior claims, there would be sufficient assets
available from the Company and its Subsidiaries to satisfy the claims of the Holders of Notes. See ‘‘Risk
Factors — If our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us, then we will not be able to make
payments on our debt, including the notes’’ and ‘‘Risk Factors — The notes are secured only by the pledge of
65% of the stock or other equity interests of certain of our first-tier subsidiaries, and assets of our
subsidiaries will first be applied to repay indebtedness and liabilities of our subsidiaries and may not be
sufficient to repay the notes.’’

In addition to the foregoing, the Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all of the
Indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company’s Subsidiaries, which, on a pro forma basis as of March 31,
2002, would have been approximately $220 million (including approximately $74 million in deferred income
taxes) recorded on our pro forma balance sheet. Furthermore, the Indebtedness of certain of the Company’s
Subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement is or will be secured by Liens on substantially all current assets of
such Subsidiaries. The Notes will not have the benefit of this collateral, nor any other assets of the
Company’s Subsidiaries. Accordingly, if an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement, the lenders
under the Credit Agreement will have a right to such assets and may foreclose upon their collateral. In that
case, such assets would first be used to repay in full amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and
may not be available to repay the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy event affecting any of the Subsidiaries,
local bankruptcy law would be likely to apply. In general, such local bankruptcy law affords significant
protection for senior secured creditors and there can be no assurances that, in the event of bankruptcy events

63


-----

affecting Subsidiaries of the Company, senior secured creditors could take actions that would materially and
adversely affect the value of the Company’s ongoing business and the equity value of such Subsidiaries. The
remaining value, if any, of the Company’s assets may not be sufficient to repay the Notes.

**Security**

The Notes are secured only by the pledge of 65% of the Capital Stock of the Company’s first-tier
operating Subsidiaries. Each of the pledges securing the Notes will be made under and will be governed by
the local law of the jurisdiction where each of our pledged Subsidiaries are formed; those jurisdictions are
Denmark, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. As a result, the validity of those pledges and the ability
of Holders to realize any benefit associated with the pledged shares may be limited under applicable local law
as any action to enforce the stock pledges must be taken under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction and
such laws may differ in significant respects from the laws of the United States. Furthermore, the rights of the
Trustee or the Holders to foreclose upon and sell the pledged shares upon the occurrence of a default will be
subject to limitations under applicable local bankruptcy laws if a bankruptcy proceeding were commenced
against the Company or its Subsidiaries. Any delay or inability to realize any benefit associated with the Lien
in any jurisdiction or the application of local bankruptcy laws that are contrary to Holders’ interests could
have a material adverse effect on the Lien we have granted on certain of the Company’s first-tier Subsidiaries
and could result in an inability to realize the full value of the share pledges entered into in connection with
the issuance of the Notes.

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each Holder will have the right to require that the
Company purchase all or a portion of such Holder’s Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the
‘‘Change of Control Offer’’), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued
interest to the date of purchase.

Within 60 days following the date upon which the Change of Control occurred, the Company must send,
by first class mail, a notice to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of
the Change of Control Offer. Such notice shall state, among other things, the purchase date, which must be
no earlier than 30 days nor later than 45 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may be
required by law (the ‘‘Change of Control Payment Date’’). In the event of a Change of Control, the Company
will also publish a notice of the offer to purchase in accordance with the procedures described under
‘‘— Notices.’’ Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be
required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled ‘‘Option of Holder to Elect Purchase’’ on the reverse
of the Note completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of
business on the third business day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a
third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Company will have available
funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control purchase price for all the Notes that might be delivered by
Holders seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. In the event the Company is required to purchase
outstanding Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Company expects that it would seek third party
financing to the extent it does not have available funds to meet its purchase obligations. However, there can
be no assurance that the Company would be able to obtain such financing.

Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor the Trustee may waive the covenant relating to a
Holder’s right to redemption upon a Change of Control. Restrictions in the Indenture described herein on the
ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur additional Indebtedness, to grant Liens on its
property, to make Restricted Payments and to make Asset Sales may also make more difficult or discourage a

64


-----

takeover of the Company, whether favored or opposed by the management of the Company. Consummation of
any such transaction in certain circumstances may require redemption or repurchase of the Notes, and there
can be no assurance that the Company or the acquiring party will have sufficient financial resources to effect
such redemption or repurchase. Such restrictions and the restrictions on transactions with Affiliates may, in
certain circumstances, make more difficult or discourage any leveraged buyout of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by the management of the Company. While such restrictions cover a wide variety of
arrangements which have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions, the Indenture may not
afford the Holders protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged transaction,
reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection
with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the ‘‘Change of Control’’ provisions of the Indenture, the
Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the ‘‘Change of Control’’ provisions of the Indenture by virtue thereof.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants:

_Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness._ The Company will not, and will not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume, guarantee, acquire, become liable,
contingently or otherwise, with respect to, or otherwise become responsible for payment of (collectively,
‘‘incur’’) any Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness); provided, however, that if no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or as a consequence of the incurrence
of any such Indebtedness, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is, or, upon such incurrence,
becomes, a Guarantor may incur Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Acquired Indebtedness) and any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not or will not, upon such incurrence, become a Guarantor may
incur Acquired Indebtedness, in each case if on the date of the incurrence of such Indebtedness, after giving
effect to the incurrence thereof, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is greater
than 2.5 to 1.0.

The Company and any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor will not incur any Indebtedness that is
expressly subordinated to any senior Indebtedness of the Company or any such Guarantor unless such
Indebtedness is also expressly subordinated on the same basis to the Notes or any such guarantees.

_Limitation on Restricted Payments._ The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution (other than dividends or distributions
payable in Qualified Capital Stock of the Company) on or in respect of shares of the Company’s Capital
Stock to holders of such Capital Stock;

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Capital Stock of the Company or
any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire shares of any class of such Capital Stock;

(3) make any principal payment on, purchase, defease, redeem, prepay, decrease or otherwise
acquire or retire for value, prior to any scheduled final maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled
sinking fund payment, any Indebtedness of the Company that is subordinate or junior in right of payment
to the Notes; or

(4) make any Investment (other than Permitted Investments) (each of the foregoing actions set forth
in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) being referred to as a ‘‘Restricted Payment’’);

65


-----

if at the time of such Restricted Payment or immediately after giving effect thereto,

(i) a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(ii) the Company is not able to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted
Indebtedness) in compliance with the ‘‘Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness’’ covenant;
_provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (ii), the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the_
Company, after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, must be greater than 3.0 to 1.0; or

(iii) the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments (including such proposed Restricted Payment) made
subsequent to the Issue Date (the amount expended for such purposes, if other than in cash, being the fair
market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company) shall
exceed the sum of:

(v) 75% of the cumulative Consolidated Net Income (or if cumulative Consolidated Net Income
shall be a loss, minus 100% of such loss) of the Company earned subsequent to the Issue Date and on
or prior to the date the Restricted Payment occurs (the ‘‘Reference Date’’) (treating such period as a
single accounting period); plus

(w) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from any Person (other than
a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) from the issuance and sale subsequent to the Issue Date and on
or prior to the Reference Date of Qualified Capital Stock of the Company or warrants, options or other
rights to acquire Qualified Capital Stock of the Company (but excluding any debt security that is
convertible into, or exchangeable for, Qualified Capital Stock); plus

(x) without duplication of any amounts included in clause (iii)(w) above, 100% of the aggregate net
cash proceeds of any equity contribution received by the Company from a holder of the Company’s
Capital Stock (excluding, in the case of clause (iii)(w) and this clause (iii)(x), any net cash proceeds
from a Public Equity Offering to the extent used to redeem the Notes in compliance with the provisions
set forth under ‘‘Redemption — Optional Redemption upon Public Equity Offerings.’’); plus

(y) without duplication, the sum of:

(1) the aggregate amount returned in cash on or with respect to Investments (other than
Permitted Investments) made subsequent to the Issue Date whether through interest payments,
principal payments, dividends or other distributions or payments;

(2) the net cash proceeds received by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from
the disposition of all or any portion of Investments (other than Permitted Investments) made
subsequent to the Issue Date other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; and

(3) upon redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary, the fair market
value of such Subsidiary; provided, however, that the sum of amounts governed by clauses (1),
(2) and (3) above shall first be included under this clause (y) and, to the extent that the sum of
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above exceeds the aggregate amount of all Investments (other than Permitted
Investments) made subsequent to the Issue Date, shall be included under clause (v) above as
included in Consolidated Net Income; plus

(z) $25 million.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph do not
prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration of such dividend if the
dividend would have been permitted on the date of declaration;

(2) the acquisition or redemption of any shares of Capital Stock of the Company, either (i) solely in
exchange for shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the Company or (ii) through the application of net
proceeds of a substantially concurrent sale for cash (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company) of shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the Company;

66


-----

(3) the acquisition or redemption of any Indebtedness of the Company that is subordinate or junior
in right of payment to the Notes either (i) solely in exchange for shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the
Company or (ii) through the application of net proceeds of (a) a substantially concurrent sale for cash
(other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of shares of Qualified Capital Stock of the
Company or (b) if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Refinancing
Indebtedness;

(4) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, repurchases
by the Company of Common Stock of the Company (or options or warrants to purchase such Common
Stock) from directors, officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
authorized representatives upon the death, disability, retirement or termination of employment of such
directors, officers and employees, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $3 million in any calendar year;

(5) on or before 200 days after the Issue Date, the partial or complete redemption of any one or
more of (i) the 738 shares of the Company’s outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, $100 par value,
(ii) the 647 shares of the Company’s outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, $100 par value, and (iii) the
5,500,000 shares of the Company’s outstanding Profit Participation Certificates, DM100 par value, in
each case including any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, using as consideration the Company’s
notes or loans receivable from its Affiliates and existing as of the Issue Date (including accrued and
unpaid interest thereon);

(6) on or before 200 days from the Issue Date, the partial or complete conversion into Qualified
Capital Stock of the Company of any one or more of (i) the 738 shares of the Company’s outstanding
Series A Preferred Stock, $100 par value, (ii) the 647 shares of the Company’s outstanding Series B
Preferred Stock, $100 par value, and (iii) the 5,500,000 shares of the Company’s outstanding Profit

thereon;

(7) on or before 200 days from the Issue Date, the dividend or other transfer by the Company to

(8) on or before 200 days from the Issue Date, the redemption of any Qualified Capital Stock of
the Company, using as consideration all or a portion of the Company’s notes receivable from Affiliates
and existing as of the Issue Date (including accrued and unpaid interest thereon); and

(9) one or more Restricted Payments of the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes,
on or promptly after the Issue Date as set forth in, and for the purposes described under, ‘‘Use of
Proceeds’’ and, if any net proceeds remain after such Restricted Payment(s), additional Restricted
Payment(s), promptly after the Issue Date, in an aggregate amount up to the amount of such remaining
net proceeds from such issuance and sale.

In determining the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments made subsequent to the Issue Date in
accordance with clause (iii) of the immediately preceding paragraph, amounts expended pursuant to
clauses (1), (2)(ii) (to the extent included in the calculation of net cash proceeds in clause (iii)(w) above),
3(ii)(a) (to the extent included in the calculation of net cash proceeds in clause (iii)(w) above) and (4) shall
be included in such calculation and amounts expended pursuant to clauses (2)(i), (2)(ii) (to the extent not
included in the calculation of net cash proceeds in clause (iii)(w) above), (3)(i), (3)(ii)(a) (to the extent not
included in the calculation of net cash proceeds in clause (iii)(w) above), 3(ii)(b), (5), (6), (7), (8) and
(9) shall be excluded from such calculation, in each case without duplication.

_Limitation on Asset Sales._ The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value of the assets sold or otherwise
disposed of (as determined in good faith by the Company’s Board of Directors);

67


-----

(2) at least 75% of the consideration received by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, from such Asset Sale shall be in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents and is received at
the time of such disposition; provided, however, that for the purposes of this provision, the amount of
any liability that would be shown on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance with GAAP and immediately prior to the time of such
Asset Sale, other than liabilities that are by their terms expressly subordinated to the Notes, that are
assumed by the transferee of any such Asset Sale, will be deemed to be cash; and

(3) upon the consummation of an Asset Sale, the Company shall apply, or cause such Restricted
Subsidiary to apply, the Net Cash Proceeds relating to such Asset Sale within 365 days of receipt thereof
either:

(a) to prepay any secured senior Indebtedness of the Company or senior Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary and, in the case of any such senior Indebtedness under any revolving credit
facility, effect a permanent reduction in the availability under such revolving credit facility;

(b) to acquire or otherwise make an investment or enter into a binding commitment to acquire
or otherwise make an investment in properties and assets (including Capital Stock) that replace the
properties and assets (including Capital Stock) that were the subject of such Asset Sale or in
properties and assets (including Capital Stock) that will be used in the business of the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries as existing on the Issue Date or in businesses reasonably related thereto
(‘‘Replacement Assets’’); and/or

(c) a combination of prepayment and investment permitted by the foregoing clauses (3)(a) and
(3)(b).

On the 366th day after an Asset Sale or such earlier date, if any, as the Board of Directors of the
Company or of such Restricted Subsidiary determines not to apply the Net Cash Proceeds relating to such
Asset Sale as set forth in clauses (3)(a), (3)(b) and (3)(c) of the preceding paragraph (each, a ‘‘Net Proceeds
Offer Trigger Date’’), the aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds which have not been applied on or before
such Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date as permitted in clauses (3)(a), (3)(b) and (3)(c) of the preceding
paragraph (each a ‘‘Net Proceeds Offer Amount’’) shall be applied by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary to make an offer to purchase (the ‘‘Net Proceeds Offer’’) on a date (the ‘‘Net Proceeds Offer
Payment Date’’) not less than 30 nor more than 45 days following the applicable Net Proceeds Offer Trigger
Date, from all Holders on a pro rata basis, that amount of Notes equal to the Net Proceeds Offer Amount at
a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to the date of purchase; provided, however, that if at any time any non-cash consideration
received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be, in connection
with any Asset Sale is converted into or sold or otherwise disposed of for cash (other than interest received
with respect to any such non-cash consideration), then such conversion or disposition shall be deemed to
constitute an Asset Sale hereunder and the Net Cash Proceeds thereof shall be applied in accordance with this
covenant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate
an Asset Sale without complying with such provision to the extent that (1) at least 80% of the consideration
for such Asset Sale constitutes Replacement Assets and (2) such Asset Sale is for fair market value. Any
consideration that does not constitute Replacement Assets that is received by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any Asset Sale permitted under this paragraph will constitute Net
Cash Proceeds and will be subject to the provisions set forth in the preceding paragraph.

The Company or such Restricted Subsidiary may defer the Net Proceeds Offer until there is an aggregate
unutilized Net Proceeds Offer Amount equal to or in excess of $20 million resulting from one or more Asset
Sales (at which time, the entire unutilized Net Proceeds Offer Amount, and not just the amount in excess of
$20 million, shall be applied as required pursuant to this paragraph).

In the event of the transfer of substantially all (but not all) of the property and assets of the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries as an entirety to a Person in a transaction permitted under ‘‘— Merger,

68


-----

Consolidation and Sale of Assets,’’ which transaction does not constitute a Change of Control, the successor
corporation shall be deemed to have sold the properties and assets of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries not so transferred for purposes of this covenant, and shall comply with the provisions of this
covenant with respect to such deemed sale as if it were an Asset Sale. In addition, the fair market value of
such properties and assets of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries deemed to be sold shall be deemed
to be Net Cash Proceeds for purposes of this covenant.

Each Net Proceeds Offer will be mailed to the record Holders as shown on the register of Holders within
25 days following the Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date, with a copy to the Trustee, and shall comply with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture. Upon receiving notice of the Net Proceeds Offer, Holders may elect to
tender their Notes in whole or in part in integral multiples of 41,000 in exchange for cash. To the extent
Holders properly tender Notes in an amount exceeding the Net Proceeds Offer Amount, Notes of tendering
Holders will be purchased on a pro rata basis (based on amounts tendered). A Net Proceeds Offer shall
remain open for a period of 20 business days or such longer period as may be required by law.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection
with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to a Net Proceeds Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture, the Company shall
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the ‘‘Asset Sale’’ provisions of the Indenture by virtue thereof.

After consummation of any Net Proceeds Offers, any Net Proceeds Offer Amount not applied to any
such purchase may be used by the Company for any purpose permitted by the other provisions of the
Indenture.

To the extent that any or all of the Net Cash Proceeds related to an Asset Sale of a Restricted Subsidiary
are prohibited or delayed by applicable law from being repatriated (in the form of dividends, loans or
otherwise) to the Company, the portion of such Net Cash Proceeds so affected shall not be required to be
applied at the time provided above, but may be retained by the applicable Restricted Subsidiary so long, but
only so long, as such applicable law will not permit repatriation to the Company (the Company having agreed
to cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to promptly take all actions required by the applicable law to
permit such repatriation). After such repatriation of any such affected Net Cash Proceeds is permitted under
such applicable law, such repatriation shall be immediately effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds
will be applied in a manner as described in this covenant.

_Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries._ The
Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability
of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on or in respect of its Capital Stock;

(2) make loans or advances or to pay any Indebtedness or other obligation owed to the Company or
any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Company; or

(3) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company,

(f) customary restrictions in the Credit Agreement, to the extent and in the manner in effect on the
Issue Date, and customary restrictions in other agreements governing Permitted Indebtedness to the
extent such restrictions would not reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the ability of the
Company to timely pay the principal and interest on the Notes;

(g) customary restrictions on the transfer of assets subject to any Lien permitted under the
Indenture imposed by the holder of such Lien;

(h) customary restrictions imposed by any agreement to sell assets or Capital Stock permitted under
the Indenture to any Person pending the closing of such sale;

(l) an agreement governing Indebtedness incurred to Refinance the Indebtedness issued, assumed or
incurred pursuant to an agreement referred to in clause (b), (d), (e), (f) or (j) above; provided, however,
that the provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction contained in any such Indebtedness are
not materially more restrictive in the aggregate as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company
in its good faith judgment than the provisions relating to such encumbrance or restriction contained in
agreements referred to in such clause (b), (d), (e), (f) or (j).

_Limitation on Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries._ The Company will not permit any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any Preferred Stock (other than to the Company or to a Wholly Owned
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) or permit any Person (other than the Company or a Wholly Owned
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) to own any Preferred Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company.

_Limitation on Liens._ The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or permit or suffer to exist any Liens of any kind
against or upon any property or assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries whether owned
on the Issue Date or acquired after the Issue Date, or any proceeds therefrom, or assign or otherwise convey
any right to receive income or profits therefrom, unless:

(1) in the case of Liens securing Indebtedness that is expressly subordinate or junior in right of
payment to the Notes, the Notes are secured by a Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior
in priority to such Liens; and

(2) in all other cases, the Notes are equally and ratably secured, except for:

(a) Liens existing as of the Issue Date to the extent and in the manner such Liens are in effect
on the Issue Date and any amendments, extensions, renewals or substitutions thereof provided that

of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries not securing the Indebtedness so
Refinanced; and

(g) Permitted Liens.

_Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets._ The Company will not, in a single transaction or series of
related transactions, consolidate or merge with or into any Person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of (or cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to sell, assign, transfer,
lease, convey or otherwise dispose of) all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (determined on a
consolidated basis for the Company and the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries) whether as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to any Person unless:

(1) either:

(a) the Company shall be the surviving or continuing corporation; or

(b) the Person (if other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or into which the
Company is merged or the Person which acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or
other disposition the properties and assets of the Company and of the Company’s Restricted
Subsidiaries substantially as an entirety (the ‘‘Surviving Entity’’):

(x) shall be a corporation organized and validly existing under the laws of the United
States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia; and

(y) shall expressly assume, by supplemental indenture (in form and substance satisfactory
to the Trustee), executed and delivered to the Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the

the Consolidated Net Worth of the Company immediately prior to such transaction and (b) shall be able
to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) pursuant to the

-----

(4) the Company or the Surviving Entity shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate
and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition and, if a supplemental indenture is required in connection with such
transaction, such supplemental indenture comply with the applicable provisions of the Indenture and that
all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been satisfied.

For purposes of the foregoing, the transfer (by lease, assignment, sale or otherwise, in a single
transaction or series of transactions) of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of one or more
Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company the Capital Stock of which constitutes all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Company, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Company.

The Indenture will provide that upon any consolidation, combination or merger or any transfer of all or

merged or to which such conveyance, lease or transfer is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and
may exercise every right and power of, the Company under the Indenture and the Notes with the same effect
as if such surviving entity had been named as such.

Without limiting any of the activities and transactions that Kronos Titan-GmbH & Co. OHG, a
partnership, may engage in or undertake consistent with the Indenture, Kronos Titan-GmbH & Co. OHG may
through a merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction continue or succeed as a
corporation incorporated under the laws of Germany; provided that such transaction does not adversely affect
the Lien on the Capital Stock of Kronos Titan-GmbH & Co. OHG for the benefit of the Holders.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will consolidate or merge with
NL Industries or any successor to NL Industries.

Each Guarantor (other than any Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the
terms of the Guarantee and the Indenture in connection with any transaction complying with the provisions of

organized and existing under the laws of the European Union, any state that is a member of the
European Union on the Issue Date, the United States, any State thereof, the District of Columbia or
Norway;

(2) such entity assumes by supplemental indenture all of the obligations of the Guarantor on the
Guarantee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing; and

surviving entity) or another Guarantor need only comply with clause (4) of the first paragraph of this
covenant.

rendering of any service) with, or for the benefit of, any of its Affiliates (each an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’),
other than Affiliate Transactions on terms that are no less favorable than those that might reasonably have
been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s-length basis from a Person that is not an
Affiliate of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary.

common plan) involving aggregate payments or other property with a fair market value in excess of
$2 million shall be approved by the Board of Directors of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, such approval to be evidenced by a Board Resolution stating that such Board of Directors has
determined that such transaction complies with the foregoing provisions. If the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company enters into an Affiliate Transaction (or a series of related Affiliate Transactions
related to a common plan) that involves an aggregate fair market value of more than $12.5 million, the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall, prior to the consummation thereof, obtain
a favorable opinion as to the fairness of such transaction or series of related transactions to the Company or
the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, from a financial point of view, from an Independent
Financial Advisor and file the same with the Trustee.

(4) purchases and sales of product and raw materials, insurance arrangements and payments, all of
the foregoing in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or as may be necessary to
accommodate legal, regulatory or other changes in the business of the Company and its Restricted

-----

(5) Restricted Payments (or Permitted Investments set forth in clauses (4), (7) and (13) of the

_Limitation of Guarantees by Restricted Subsidiaries._ The Company will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, by way of the pledge of any intercompany note or otherwise, to assume,
guarantee or in any other manner become liable with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company or any

guarantee or other instrument provided by such Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such subordinated
Indebtedness shall be subordinated to the Guarantee pursuant to subordination provisions no less
favorable to the Holders of the Notes than those contained in such other Indebtedness.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Notes shall (and
shall provide by its terms that it shall) be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without
any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, upon:

(1) the unconditional release of such Restricted Subsidiary from its assumption, guarantee or other
liability in respect of the Indebtedness in connection with which such Guarantee was executed and
delivered pursuant to the preceding paragraph; or

(2) any sale or other disposition (by merger or otherwise) to any Person which is not a Restricted

Restricted Subsidiary; provided that (a) such sale or disposition of such Capital Stock or assets is
otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and (b) such assumption, guarantee or other
liability of such Restricted Subsidiary has been released by the holders of the other Indebtedness so
guaranteed.

shall have gross assets of less than $3 million (net of assets contributed thereto for the express purposes of
expunging contingent liabilities), and any other direct Restricted Subsidiary having gross assets of less than
$1 million), unless, concurrently with the formation, acquisition or maintenance of such Subsidiary, the
Company shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the Trustee for the benefit of
Holders, one or more pledge agreements, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
pursuant to which not less than 65% of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary is pledged to the Trustee for the

Agreement, whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the Commission, the Company will file a

the relevant Collateral Documents and reconvey the Released Collateral to the Company immediately prior to
such sale or disposition upon compliance with the condition that the Company deliver to the Trustee the
following:

(a) an officers’ certificate of the Company stating that (i) all Net Cash Proceeds, if any, from the
sale of any of the Released Collateral will be applied pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture in
respect of Asset Sales, (ii) there is no Default or Event of Default in effect and continuing on the date
thereof, (iii) the release of the Collateral and the sale or disposition will not result in a Default or Event

tendered pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or a Net Proceeds Offer);

(3) a default in the observance or performance of any other covenant or agreement contained in the
Indenture which default continues for a period of 45 days after the Company receives written notice
specifying the default (and demanding that such default be remedied) from the Trustee or the Holders of
at least 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (except in the case of a default with
respect to the ‘‘Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets’’ covenant, which will constitute an Event of
Default with such notice requirement but without such passage of time requirement);

(4) the failure to pay at final maturity (giving effect to any applicable grace periods and any
extensions thereof) the principal amount of any Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company, or the acceleration of the final stated maturity of any such Indebtedness
(which acceleration is not rescinded, annulled or otherwise cured within 20 days of receipt by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary of notice of any such acceleration) if the aggregate principal
amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in
default for failure to pay principal at final maturity or which has been accelerated (in each case with
respect to which the 20-day period described above has elapsed), aggregates $20 million or more at any
time;

(5) the repudiation by the Company of any of its obligations under any Collateral Document, or the
unenforceability of any Collateral Document against the Company if such unenforceability reasonably
would be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the Liens granted by the Company pursuant
to such Collateral Documents;

(6) one or more judgments in an aggregate amount in excess of $20 million shall have been
rendered against the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and such judgments remain
undischarged, unpaid or unstayed for a period of 60 days after such judgment or judgments become final
and non-appealable; or

(7) certain events of bankruptcy affecting the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (6) above with respect to the
Company) shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
outstanding Notes may declare the principal of and accrued interest on all the Notes to be due and payable by
notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee specifying the respective Event of Default and that it is a
‘‘notice of acceleration’’ (the ‘‘Acceleration Notice’’), and the same shall become immediately due and
payable.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (6) above with respect to the Company occurs and is
continuing, then all unpaid principal of, and premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the
outstanding Notes shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or
other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

The Indenture will provide that, at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes
as described in the preceding paragraph, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may
rescind and cancel such declaration and its consequences:

(1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree;

(2) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpayment of principal or
interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration;

(3) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest
and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has
been paid;

76


-----

(4) if the Company has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee for
its expenses, disbursements and advances; and

(5) in the event of the cure or waiver of an Event of Default of the type described in clause (6) of
the description above of Events of Default, the Trustee shall have received an officers’ certificate and an
opinion of counsel that such Event of Default has been cured or waived. No such rescission shall affect
any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may waive any existing Default or Event of
Default under the Indenture, and its consequences, except a default in the payment of the principal of or
interest on any Notes.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and
under the TIA. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, the Trustee is
under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request, order or
direction of any of the Holders, unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity. Subject
to all provisions of the Indenture and applicable law, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Notes have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

Under the Indenture, the Company is required to provide an officers’ certificate to the Trustee promptly
upon any such officer obtaining knowledge of any Default or Event of Default (provided that such officers
shall provide such certification at least annually whether or not they know of any Default or Event of Default)
that has occurred and, if applicable, describe such Default or Event of Default and the status thereof.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and the obligations of the
Guarantors discharged with respect to the outstanding Notes (‘‘Legal Defeasance’’). Such Legal Defeasance
means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by
the outstanding Notes, except for:

(1) the rights of Holders to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes when such payments are due;

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payments;

(3) the rights, powers, trust, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the Company’s obligations in
connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the
Company released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture (‘‘Covenant
Defeasance’’) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or
Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not
including non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, reorganization and insolvency events) described under
‘‘Events of Default’’ will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders
cash in Euros or Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient,
in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or on the applicable
redemption date, as the case may be and, in the event that the Trustee at any time determines the amount
on deposit is insufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the stated

77


-----

date for payment thereof or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, the Company must
irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders additional cash in Euros or
Government Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be, together with prior
deposit(s), sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to
pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the stated date for payment thereof or
on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of
counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and
will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion
of counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders will not
recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance
and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such
deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to
such deposit and the granting of Liens to secure such borrowing and such deposit) or insofar as Events
of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period ending on the
91st day after the date of deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, the Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound (other than a breach, violation or default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to
such borrowing and such deposit and the granting of Liens to secure such deposit);

(6) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that the deposit
was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders over any other creditors of the
Company or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any other creditors of the
Company or others;

(7) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of
counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent specified in the Indenture providing for or relating to
the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with; and

(8) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that:

(a) either (i) the Company has irrevocably assigned all of its ownership interest in the trust
funds to the Trustee or (ii) the Trustee has a valid perfected security interest in the trust fund; and

(b) assuming no intervening bankruptcy of the Company between the date of deposit and the
91st day following the date of deposit and that no Holder is an insider of the Company, after the
91st day following the date of deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to avoidance as a
preference under Section 547 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the opinion of counsel required by clause (2) above with respect to a
Legal Defeasance need not be delivered if all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(1) have become due and payable or (2) will become due and payable on the maturity date within one year
under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the
name, and at the expense, of the Company.

78


-----

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights or
registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all
outstanding Notes when:

(1) either:

(a) all the Notes theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes
which have been replaced or paid and Notes for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Company and thereafter repaid to the
Company or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and
payable and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee
funds in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes not
theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes to the date of deposit together with irrevocable instructions from the Company
directing the Trustee to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the
case may be;

(2) the Company has paid all other sums payable under the Indenture by the Company; and

(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel
stating that all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with.

**Modification of the Indenture**

From time to time, the Company and the Trustee, without the consent of the Holders, may amend the
Indenture or Collateral Documents for certain specified purposes, including curing ambiguities, defects or
inconsistencies, so long as such change does not, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights of
any of the Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee will be
entitled to rely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, solely on an opinion
of counsel. Other modifications and amendments of the Indenture or Collateral Documents may be made with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes issued under the
Indenture, except that, without the consent of each Holder affected thereby, no amendment may:

(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the rate of or change or have the effect of changing the time for payment of interest,
including defaulted interest, on any Notes;

(3) reduce the principal of or change or have the effect of changing the fixed maturity of any Notes,
or change the date on which any Notes may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price
therefor;

(4) make any Notes payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(5) make any change in provisions of the Indenture protecting the right of each Holder to receive
payment of principal of and interest on such Note on or after the due date thereof or to bring suit to
enforce such payment, or permitting Holders of a majority in principal amount of Notes to waive
Defaults or Events of Default;

(6) after the Company’s obligation to purchase Notes arises thereunder, amend, change or modify in
any material respect the obligation of the Company to make and consummate a Change of Control Offer
in the event of a Change of Control or make and consummate a Net Proceeds Offer with respect to any
Asset Sale that has been consummated or, after such Change of Control has occurred or such Asset Sale
has been consummated, modify any of the provisions or definitions with respect thereto; or

79


-----

(7) modify or change any provision of the Indenture or the related definitions affecting the ranking
of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture will provide that it and the Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of New York but without giving effect to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the
extent that the application of the law of another jurisdiction would be required thereby.

**The Trustee**

The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will
perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of
Default, the Trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in it by the Indenture, and use the same
degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of his own affairs.

The Indenture and the provisions of the TIA contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee,
should it become a creditor of the Company, to obtain payments of claims in certain cases or to realize on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. Subject to the TIA, the
Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; provided that if the Trustee acquires any conflicting
interest as described in the TIA, it must eliminate such conflict or resign.

**Notices**

All notices shall be deemed to have been given by (1) the mailing by first-class mail, postage prepaid, of
such notices to holders of the Notes at their registered addresses as recorded in the Register; and (2) so long
as the Exchange Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and it is required by the rules of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange, publication of such notice to the holders of the Exchange Notes in English in a
leading newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort)
or, if such publication is not practicable, in one other leading English language daily newspaper with general
circulation in Europe, such newspaper being published on each business day in morning editions, whether or
not it shall be published on Saturday, Sunday or holiday editions.

calculation and any incurrence or repayment of other Indebtedness (and the application of the proceeds
thereof), other than the incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness in the ordinary course of business for

to the incurrence of such guaranteed Indebtedness as if such Person or any Restricted Subsidiary of such
Person had directly incurred or otherwise assumed such guaranteed Indebtedness.

Furthermore, in calculating ‘‘Consolidated Fixed Charges’’ for purposes of determining the denominator
(but not the numerator) of this ‘‘Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio’’:

Date and which will continue to be so determined thereafter shall be deemed to have accrued at a fixed
rate per annum equal to the rate of interest on such Indebtedness in effect on the Transaction Date; and

duplication, of:

(1) Consolidated Interest Expense; plus

(2) the product of (x) the amount of all dividend payments on any series of Preferred Stock of such
Person (other than dividends paid in Qualified Capital Stock) paid, accrued or scheduled to be paid or
accrued during such period times (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of
which is one minus the then current effective consolidated federal, state and local income tax rate of
such Person, expressed as a decimal.

_‘‘Consolidated Interest Expense’’ means, with respect to any Person for any period, the sum of, without_
duplication:

(1) the aggregate of the interest expense of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such
period determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, including without limitation:
(a) any amortization of debt discount and amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs; (b) the
net cash costs under Interest Swap Obligations; (c) all capitalized interest; and (d) the interest portion of
any deferred payment obligation; and

(2) the interest component of Capitalized Lease Obligations paid, accrued and/or scheduled to be
paid or accrued by such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries during such period as determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP.

_‘‘Consolidated Net Income’’ means, with respect to any Person, for any period, the aggregate net income_
(or loss) of such Person and its Restricted Subsidiaries for such period on a consolidated basis, determined in
accordance with GAAP; provided that there shall be excluded therefrom:

(1) after-tax gains from Asset Sales (without regard to the $2 million limitation set forth in the
definition thereof) or abandonments or reserves relating thereto;

(2) after-tax items classified as extraordinary gains in accordance with GAAP;

(3) the net income of any Person acquired in a ‘‘pooling of interests’’ transaction accrued prior to
the date it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of the referent Person or is merged or consolidated with the
referent Person or any Restricted Subsidiary of the referent Person;

Company giving effect to such designation and an officers’ certificate certifying that such designation
complied with the foregoing conditions.

_‘‘Significant Subsidiary’’, with respect to any Person, means any Restricted Subsidiary of such Person_
that satisfies the criteria for a ‘‘significant subsidiary’’ set forth in Rule 1.02(w) of Regulation S-X under the
Exchange Act.

_‘‘Standard Securitization Undertakings’’ means representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities_
entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries which are reasonably customary in an accounts receivable or
equipment securitization transactions, as applicable.

_‘‘Subsidiary’’, with respect to any Person, means:_

entitled to be cast in the election of directors under ordinary circumstances shall at the time be owned,
directly or indirectly, by such Person; or

(2) any other Person of which at least a majority of the voting interest under ordinary circumstances
is at the time, directly or indirectly, owned by such Person.

_‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiary’’ of any Person means:_

(1) any Subsidiary of such Person that at the time of determination shall be or continue to be
designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary by the Board of Directors of such Person in the manner provided
below; and

(2) any Subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

The Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including any newly acquired or newly formed
Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary unless such Subsidiary owns any Capital Stock of, or owns or
holds any Lien on any property of, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that:

(1) the Company certifies to the Trustee that such designation complies with the ‘‘Limitation on
Restricted Payments’’ covenant; and

(2) each Subsidiary to be so designated and each of its Subsidiaries has not at the time of

the assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary only if:

effect to such designation and an officers’ certificate certifying that such designation complied with the
foregoing provisions.

_‘‘Weighted Average Life to Maturity’’ means, when applied to any Indebtedness at any date, the number_
of years obtained by dividing (a) the then outstanding aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness into
(b) the sum of the total of the products obtained by multiplying (i) the amount of each then remaining
installment, sinking fund, serial maturity or other required payment of principal, including payment at final

94


-----

maturity, in respect thereof, by (ii) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth) which will
elapse between such date and the making of such payment.

_‘‘Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary’’ of any Person means any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of such_
Person which at the time of determination is a Restricted Subsidiary of such Person.

_‘‘Wholly Owned Subsidiary’’ of any Person means any Subsidiary of such Person of which all the_
outstanding voting securities (other than in the case of a foreign Subsidiary, directors’ qualifying shares or an
immaterial amount of shares required to be owned by other Persons pursuant to applicable law) are owned by

Subsidiary by the Permitted Holders does not decrease after the Issue Date (other than in respect of directors’
qualifying shares or in respect of an immaterial amount of shares required to be owned by other Persons
pursuant to applicable law).

**EXCHANGE OFFER; REGISTRATION RIGHTS**

We and the initial purchasers will enter into a registration rights agreement (the ‘‘Registration Rights
Agreement’’) on or prior to the original issue date of the notes (‘‘Issue Date’’) pursuant to which we will
agree that we will, at our expense, for the benefit of the holders of the notes (the ‘‘Holders’’), (i) within
120 days after the Issue Date (the ‘‘Filing Date’’), file a registration statement on an appropriate registration
form (the ‘‘Exchange Offer Registration Statement’’) with respect to a registered offer (the ‘‘Exchange
Offer’’) to exchange the notes for notes (the ‘‘Exchange Notes’’) of KII, which Exchange Notes will have
terms substantially identical in all material respects to the notes (except that the Exchange Notes will not
contain terms with respect to transfer restrictions) and (ii) cause the Exchange Offer Registration Statement to
be declared effective under the Securities Act within 270 days after the Issue Date. Upon the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement being declared effective, we will offer the Exchange Notes in exchange for surrender
of the notes. We will keep the Exchange Offer open for not less than 30 days (or longer if required by
applicable law) after the date notice of the Exchange Offer is mailed to the Holders. For each of the notes
surrendered to us pursuant to the Exchange Offer, the Holder who surrendered such note will receive an
Exchange Note having a principal amount equal to that of the surrendered note. Interest on each Exchange
Note will accrue (A) from the later of (i) the last interest payment date on which interest was paid on the
note surrendered in exchange therefor, or (ii) if the note is surrendered for exchange on a date in a period
which includes the record date for an interest payment date to occur on or after the date of such exchange
and as to which interest will be paid, the date of such interest payment date, or (B) if no interest has been
paid on such note, from the Issue Date.

Under existing interpretations of the Commission contained in several no-action letters to third parties,
the Exchange Notes will be freely transferable by holders thereof (other than our affiliates) after the Exchange
Offer without further registration under the Securities Act; provided, however, that each Holder that wishes to
exchange its notes for Exchange Notes will be required to represent (i) that any Exchange Notes to be
received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business, (ii) that at the time of the
commencement of the Exchange Offer it has no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate
in the distribution (within the meaning of Securities Act) of the Exchange Notes in violation of the Securities
Act, (iii) that it is not our ‘‘affiliate’’ (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under Securities Act), (iv) if such
Holder is not a broker-dealer, that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, the distribution of
Exchange Notes and (v) if such Holder is a broker-dealer (a ‘‘Participating Broker-Dealer’’) that will receive
Exchange Notes for its own account in exchange for notes which were acquired as a result of market-making
or other trading activities, that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such Exchange
Notes. We will agree to make available, during the period required by the Securities Act, a prospectus
meeting the requirements of the Securities Act for use by Participating Broker-Dealers and other persons, if
any, with similar prospectus delivery requirements for use in connection with any resale of Exchange Notes.

If (i) because of any change in law or in currently prevailing interpretations of the Staff of the
Commission, we are not permitted to effect an Exchange Offer, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not consummated
within 300 days of the Issue Date or (iii) in certain circumstances, certain holders of unregistered Exchange
Notes so request, or (iv) in the case of any Holder that participates in the Exchange Offer, such Holder does
not receive Exchange Notes on the date of the exchange that may be sold without restriction under state and
federal securities laws (other than due solely to the status of such Holder as our affiliate within the meaning
of the Securities Act), then in each case, we will (x) promptly deliver to the Holders and the Trustee written
notice thereof and (y) at our sole expense, (a) as promptly as practicable, file a shelf registration statement
covering resales of the notes (the ‘‘Shelf Registration Statement’’), and (b) use our best efforts to keep
effective the Shelf Registration Statement until the earliest of two years after the Issue Date, such time as all
of the applicable notes have been sold thereunder. We will, in the event that a Shelf Registration Statement is
filed, provide to each Holder copies of the prospectus that is a part of the Shelf Registration Statement, notify
each such Holder when the Shelf Registration Statement for the notes has become effective and take certain
other actions as are required to permit unrestricted resales of the notes. A Holder that sells notes pursuant to
the Shelf Registration Statement will be required to be named as a selling security holder in the related
prospectus and to deliver a prospectus to purchasers, will be subject to certain of the civil liability provisions

96


-----

under the Securities Act in connection with such sales and will be bound by the provisions of the Registration
Rights Agreement that are applicable to such a Holder (including certain indemnification rights and
obligations).

If we fail to meet the targets listed above, then additional interest (the ‘‘Additional Interest’’) shall
become payable in respect of the notes as follows:

(i) if (A) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor the Shelf Registration Statement is
filed with the Commission on or prior to 120 days after the Issue Date or (B) notwithstanding that we
have consummated or will consummate an Exchange Offer, we are required to file a Shelf Registration
Statement and such Shelf Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to the date required by the
Registration Rights Agreement, then commencing on the day after either such required filing date,
Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal amount of the notes at a rate of 0.25% per annum for
the first 90 days immediately following each such filing date, such Additional Interest rate increasing by
an additional 0.25% per annum at the beginning of each subsequent 90-day period; or

(ii) if (A) neither the Exchange Offer Registration Statement nor a Shelf Registration Statement is
declared effective by the Commission on or prior to 270 days after the Issue Date or (B) notwithstanding
that we have consummated or will consummate an Exchange Offer, we are required to file a Shelf
Registration Statement and such Shelf Registration Statement is not declared effective by the
Commission on or prior to the date required by the Registration Rights Agreement, then, commencing
on the day after either such required effective date, Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal
amount of the notes at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days immediately following such date,
such Additional Interest rate increasing by an additional 0.25% per annum at the beginning of each
subsequent 90-day period; or

(iii) if (A) we have not exchanged Exchange Notes for all notes validly tendered in accordance with
the terms of the Exchange Offer on or prior to the 300th day after the Issue Date or (B) if applicable,
the Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective and such Shelf Registration Statement ceases
to be effective at any time prior to the second anniversary of the Issue Date (other than after such time
as all notes have been disposed of thereunder), then Additional Interest shall accrue on the principal
amount of the notes at a rate of 0.25% per annum for the first 90 days commencing on (x) the 300th day
after the Issue Date, in the case of (A) above, or (y) the day such Shelf Registration Statement ceases to
be effective, in the case of (B) above, such Additional Interest rate increasing by an additional 0.25% per
annum at the beginning of each subsequent 90-day period;

_provided, however, that the Additional Interest rate on the notes may not accrue under more than one of the_
foregoing clauses (i) — (iii) at any one time and at no time shall the aggregate amount of Additional Interest
accruing exceed in the aggregate 0.75% per annum; provided, further, however, that (1) upon the filing of the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement (in the case of clause (i) above),
(2) upon the effectiveness of the Exchange Offer Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement (in
the case of clause (ii) above), or (3) upon the exchange of Exchange Notes for all notes tendered (in the case
of clause (iii) (A) above), or upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement which had ceased to
remain effective (in the case of clause (iii) (B) above), Additional Interest on the notes as a result of such
clause (or the relevant subclause thereof), as the case may be, shall cease to accrue.

Any amounts of Additional Interest due pursuant to clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above will be payable in cash
on the same original interest payment dates as the notes.

Certain accounting regulations of the Commission require separate audited financial statements of Kronos
Germany and Kronos Denmark, whose stock is pledged to secure the notes. Because 65% of the stock of
each of our first-tier subsidiaries with significant assets will be pledged to secure the notes and virtually all of
our net sales are generated by subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly subject to the stock pledges, we
believe that separate audited financial statements for Kronos Germany and Kronos Denmark would not be
material to an investment decision, and such separate financial information for these subsidiaries is not
included in this offering memorandum. Further, we are requesting the Commission to relieve us from

97


-----

complying with this requirement, which would be burdensome and costly to us while providing no meaningful
benefit to investors in our view. Should the Commission not grant our request, such separate audited financial
statements will be included in our filings with the Commission. In addition, certain other technical disclosure
requirements of the Commission with respect to interest and foreign exchange rate sensitivity and a summary
of our debt and operating lease commitments are not included in this offering memorandum as we do not
consider such disclosure material to an investment decision since substantially all of such information is
contained in this offering memorandum. We do, however, intend to furnish such other technical disclosures in
our filings with the Commission.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

Because the following restrictions will apply unless we complete the Exchange Offer for the notes or
otherwise cause registration statements with respect to the resale of the notes to be declared effective under
the Securities Act, purchasers are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or
transfer of any of the notes. See ‘‘Description of the Notes.’’

None of the notes has been registered under the Securities Act and they may not be offered or sold
within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the
notes are being offered and sold by the initial purchasers only (A) to ‘‘qualified institutional buyers’’ (as
defined in Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act (‘‘Rule 144A’’)) (‘‘QIBs’’) in compliance with
Rule 144A, and (B) outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons (‘‘non-U.S. purchasers,’’
which term shall include dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a
discretionary basis for non-U.S. beneficial owners (other than an estate or trust)) in reliance upon
Regulation S under the Securities Act (‘‘Regulation S’’). As used in this section, the terms ‘‘United States’’
and ‘‘U.S. person’’ have the meanings given to them in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of notes will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

1. It is purchasing the notes for its own account or an account with respect to which it exercises
sole investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a QIB, and is aware that the
sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A and (B) a non-U.S. purchaser that is outside the
United States (or a non-U.S. purchaser that is a dealer or other fiduciary as referred to above).

2. It acknowledges that the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except as set
forth below.

3. It shall not resell or otherwise transfer any of such notes within two years after the original
issuance of the notes except (A) to us or any of our subsidiaries, (B) inside the United States to a QIB
in a transaction complying with Rule 144A, (C) inside the United States to institutional ‘‘accredited
investors’’ (as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act) (an ‘‘Accredited
Investor’’), that, prior to such transfer, furnishes (or has furnished on its behalf by a U.S. broker-dealer)
to the Trustee a signed letter containing certain representations and agreements relating to the restrictions
on transfer of the notes (the form of which letter can be obtained from such Trustee), (D) outside the
United States in compliance with Rule 904 under the Securities Act, (E) pursuant to the exemption from
registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available), (F) in accordance with another
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (and based upon an opinion of
counsel if we so request), or (G) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act.

4. It agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the notes prior notice of any
restrictions on transfer of such notes.

5. It acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of notes in certificated form or of beneficial
interests in a note in global form (a ‘‘Global Note’’) (in each case other than pursuant to an effective
registration statement) the holder of notes or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the

98


-----

case may be, may be required to provide certifications and other documentation relating to the manner of
such transfer and submit such certifications and other documentation as provided in the Indenture.

6. It understands that all of the notes will bear a legend substantially to the following effect unless
otherwise agreed by us and the holder thereof:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE ‘‘SECURITIES ACT’’), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE
OFFERED OR SOLD WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OR
BENEFIT OF, U.S. PERSONS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW. BY ITS ACQUISITION
HEREOF, THE HOLDER (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A) IT IS A ‘‘QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
BUYER’’ (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT), (B) IT IS NOT A
U.S. PERSON AND IS ACQUIRING THIS SECURITY IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION IN
COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 904 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (C) IT IS AN
ACCREDITED INVESTOR (AS DEFINED IN RULE 501(a)(1), (2), (3), OR (7) UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT (AN ‘‘ACCREDITED INVESTOR’’), (2) AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT
WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF THIS SECURITY RESELL OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS SECURITY EXCEPT (A) TO KRONOS INTERNATIONAL,
INC. OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) INSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO A QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144A UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT, (C) INSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR THAT, PRIOR TO
SUCH TRANSFER, FURNISHES (OR HAS FURNISHED ON ITS BEHALF BY A U.S.
BROKER-DEALER) TO THE TRUSTEE A SIGNED LETTER CONTAINING CERTAIN
REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY (THE FORM OF WHICH LETTER CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE
TRUSTEE FOR THIS SECURITY), (D) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN AN OFFSHORE
TRANSACTION IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 904 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (IF
AVAILABLE), (E) PURSUANT TO THE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY
RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (IF AVAILABLE), (F) IN ACCORDANCE WITH
ANOTHER EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT (AND BASED UPON AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IF KRONOS INTERNATIONAL,
INC. SO REQUESTS), OR (G) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND (3) AGREES THAT IT WILL GIVE TO EACH PERSON
TO WHOM THIS SECURITY IS TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE
EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND IN ADVANCE OF SUCH TRANSFER. IN CONNECTION WITH
ANY TRANSFER OF THIS SECURITY WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER THE ORIGINAL
ISSUANCE OF THIS SECURITY, IF THE PROPOSED TRANSFEREE IS AN ACCREDITED
INVESTOR, THE HOLDER MUST, PRIOR TO SUCH TRANSFER, FURNISH TO THE
TRUSTEE AND KRONOS INTERNATIONAL, INC. SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL OPINIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS EITHER OF THEM MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO
CONFIRM THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS BEING MADE PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION
FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES ACT. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERMS ‘‘OFFSHORE TRANSACTION,’’
‘‘UNITED STATES’’ AND ‘‘U.S. PERSON’’ HAVE THE MEANING GIVEN TO THEM BY
REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

7. It shall not sell or otherwise transfer such notes to, and each purchaser represents and covenants
that it is not acquiring the notes for or on behalf of, and will not transfer the notes to, any pension or
welfare plan (as defined in Section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(‘‘ERISA’’)), except that such a purchase for or on behalf of a pension or welfare plan shall be
permitted:

(a) to the extent such purchase is made by or on behalf of a bank collective investment fund
maintained by the purchaser in which, at any time while the notes are held by the purchaser, no
plan (together with any other plans maintained by the same employer or employee organization) has

99


-----

an interest in excess of 10% of the total assets in such collective investment fund and the conditions
of Section III of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 91-38 issued by the Department of Labor
are satisfied;

(b) to the extent such purchase is made by or on behalf of an insurance company pooled
separate account maintained by the purchaser in which, at any time while the notes are held by the
purchaser, no plan (together with any other plans maintained by the same employer or employee
organization) has an interest in excess of 10% of the total of all assets in such pooled separate
account and the conditions of Section III of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 90-1 issued by
the Department of Labor are satisfied;

(c) to the extent such purchase is made by or on behalf of an insurance company general
account maintained by the purchaser in which, at any time while the notes are held by the
purchaser, the conditions of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 95-60 issued by the
Department of Labor are satisfied;

(d) to the extent such purchase is made on behalf of a plan by (i) an investment adviser
registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that had as of the last day of its most recent
fiscal year total assets under its management and control in excess of $50,000,000 and had
stockholders’ or partners’ equity in excess of $750,000, as shown in its most recent balance sheet
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (ii) a bank as defined in
Section 202(a)(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 with equity capital in excess of
$1,000,000 as of the last day of its most recent fiscal year, (iii) an insurance company which is
qualified under the laws of more than one state to manage, acquire or dispose of any assets of a
plan, which insurance company has, as of the last day of its most recent fiscal year, net worth in
excess of $1,000,000 and which is subject to supervision and examination by a state authority
having supervision over insurance companies, or (iv) a savings and loan association, the accounts of
which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, that has made application for and
been granted trust powers to manage, acquire or dispose of assets of a plan by a State or Federal
authority having supervision over savings and loan associations, which savings and loan association
has, as of the last day of its most recent fiscal year, equity capital or net worth in excess of
$1,000,000 and, in any case, such investment adviser, bank, insurance company or savings and loan
is otherwise a qualified professional asset manager, as such term is used in Prohibited Transaction
Exception 84-14 issued by the Department of Labor, and the assets of such plan when combined
with the assets of other plans established or maintained by the same employer (or affiliate thereof)
or employee organization and managed by such investment adviser, bank, insurance company or
savings and loan do not represent more than 20% of the total client assets managed by such
investment adviser, bank, insurance company or savings and loan and the conditions of Section I of
such exemption are otherwise satisfied;

(e) to the extent such plan is a governmental plan (as defined in Section 3 of ERISA) which is
not subject to the provisions of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code; or

(f) to the extent the purchase is made by or on behalf of an investment fund managed by an
‘‘in-house asset manager’’ (the ‘‘INHAM’’) (as defined in Part IV of Prohibited Transaction Class
Exemption 96-23 issued by the Department of Labor), plans maintained by affiliates of the INHAM
and/or the INHAM have aggregate assets in excess of $250 million, and the conditions of Part I of
Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 96-23 are otherwise satisfied.

8. It acknowledges that the Trustee will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any
notes acquired by it, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the Trustee of
compliance with the restrictions set forth herein.

9. It acknowledges that we, the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy
of the foregoing acknowledgments, representations and agreements and agrees that if any of the
acknowledgments, representations or agreements deemed to have been made by its purchase of the notes

100


-----

are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify us and the initial purchasers. If it is acquiring the notes
as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment
discretion with respect to each such account and it has full power to make the foregoing
acknowledgments, representations, and agreements on behalf of each account.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

The notes are being offered and sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A
(‘‘Rule 144A Notes’’). The notes also may be offered and sold in offshore transactions in reliance on
Regulation S (‘‘Regulation S Notes’’). Except as set forth below, notes will be issued in registered, global
form in minimum denominations of 41,000 and integral multiples thereof. The notes will be issued at the
closing of the offering only against payment in immediately available funds.

The notes (whether Rule 144A Notes or Regulation S Notes) will be represented by one global note in
fully registered form without interest coupons (the ‘‘Global Note’’) and will be deposited with The Bank of
New York, London Branch, as common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (the ‘‘Common
Depositary’’), and registered in the name of a nominee of the Common Depositary. The notes will not be
eligible for clearance through The Depository Trust Company. The Global Note will be subject to certain
restrictions on transfer set forth therein and in the indenture and will bear the legend regarding such
restrictions set forth under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Except in the limited circumstances described below, owners of beneficial interests in global notes will
not be entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated notes. Transfers of beneficial interests in the global
notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective
direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may change from time to time.

_Global Notes_

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided
solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the
respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them from time to time. We take no
responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their
participants directly to discuss these matters.

Upon the issuance of the Global Note, the Common Depositary will credit, on its internal system, the
respective principal amount of the beneficial interests represented by such global note to the accounts of
Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will credit, on its
internal systems, the respective principal amounts of the individual beneficial interests in such global notes to
the accounts of persons who have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be. Such accounts
initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers. Ownership of beneficial interests in the
Global Note will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream, as the case may be. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Note will be shown on, and
the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by Euroclear or Clearstream,
as the case may be, or their nominees (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants
(with respect to interests of persons other than participants).

**As long as the Common Depositary, or its nominee, is the registered holder of a global note, the**
**Common Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner and holder**
**of the notes represented by such global notes for all purposes under the indenture and the notes. Unless**
(1) Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a clearing agency, (2) the
Common Depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Common Depositary and a
successor Common Depositary is not appointed within 120 days of such notice or (3) in the case of any note,
an event of default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such note, owners of beneficial interests in
a global note will not be entitled to have any portions of such global note registered in their names, will not
receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the

101


-----

owners or holders of the global note (or any notes represented thereby) under the indenture or the notes. In
addition, no beneficial owner of an interest in a global note will be able to transfer that interest except in
accordance with Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s applicable procedures (in addition to those under the indenture
referred to herein).

Investors may hold their interests in the Global Note through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are
participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such systems.
Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests in the Global Note on behalf of their participants through
customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of the Common Depositary. All
interests in the Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Payments of the principal of and interest on the Global Note will be made to the order of the Common
Depositary or its nominee as the registered owner thereof. Neither KII, the Trustee, the Common Depositary
nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating
to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the global notes or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

We expect that the Common Depositary, in its capacity as paying agent, upon receipt of any payment or
principal or interest in respect of a global note representing any notes held by it or its nominee, will
immediately credit the accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, which in turn will
immediately credit accounts of participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, with payments in
amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such global note for
such notes as shown on the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be. We also expect that
payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in such global note held through such participants
will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for
the accounts of customers registered in ‘‘street name.’’ Such payments will be the responsibility of such
participants.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can act only on behalf of their respective participants, who in turn
act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of a holder of a beneficial interest in
global notes to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or
Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a
definitive certificate for such interest. The laws of some countries and some U.S. states require that certain
persons take physical delivery of securities in certificated form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests in a global note to such persons may be limited.

Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be
effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of
one or more participants to whose account with Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, interests in the
global notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of
default under the notes, Euroclear and Clearstream reserve the right to exchange the global notes for legended
notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to their respective participants.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us as follows: Euroclear and Clearstream each hold securities
for their account holders and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions by electronic
book-entry transfer between their respective account holders, thereby eliminating the need for physical
movements of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities.

Euroclear and Clearstream each provide various services including safekeeping, administration, clearance
and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and
Clearstream each also deal with domestic securities markets in several countries through established
depository and custodial relationships. The respective systems of Euroclear and Clearstream have established

102


-----

an electronic bridge between their two systems across which their respective account holders may settle trades
with each other.

Account holders in both Euroclear and Clearstream are world-wide financial institutions including
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, trust companies and clearing corporations. Indirect access of both
Euroclear and Clearstream is available to other institutions that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with an account holder of either system.

An account holder’s overall contractual relations with either Euroclear or Clearstream are governed by
the respective rules and operation procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream and any applicable laws. Both
Euroclear and Clearstream act under such rules and operating procedures only on behalf of their respective
account holders, and have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their respective account
holders.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of
interests in global notes among participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to do
so, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. Neither we nor the Trustee will have
any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

_Certificated Notes_

If any depositary is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the notes for the
reasons set forth above, we will issue certificates for such notes in definitive, fully registered, non-global form
without interest coupons in exchange for the Global Notes. Certificates for notes delivered in exchange for
any global note or beneficial interests therein will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved
denominations, requested by Euroclear, Clearstream or the Common Depositary (in accordance with their
customary procedures).

Certificates for non-global notes issued in exchange for a Global Note (or any portion thereof) will bear
the legend referred to under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ The holder of a non-global note may transfer such note,
subject to compliance with the provisions of the applicable legend, by surrendering it at the office or agency
maintained by us for such purpose in London, which initially will be the office of the Trustee or of the
Transfer Agent in Luxembourg. Upon the transfer, change or replacement of any note bearing a legend, or
upon specific request for removal of a legend on a note, we will deliver only notes that bear such legend, or
will refuse to remove such legend, as the case may be, unless there is delivered to us such satisfactory
evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel, as may reasonably be required by us that neither such
legend nor any restrictions on transfer set forth therein are required to ensure compliance with the provisions
of the Securities Act. Before any note in non-global form may be transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of an interest in any global note, the transferor will be required to provide the Trustee with a
restricted global note certificate. Upon transfer or partial redemption of any note, new certificates may be
obtained from the Transfer Agent in Luxembourg.

Notwithstanding any statement herein, we and the Trustee reserve the right to impose such transfer,
certification, exchange or other requirements, and to require such restrictive legends on certificates evidencing
notes, as they may determine are necessary to ensure compliance with the securities laws of the United States
and the states therein and any other applicable laws or as Euroclear or Clearstream may require.

_Same-Day Settlement and Payment_

The indenture will require that payments in respect of the notes represented by the global notes,
including principal, premium, if any, interest and liquidated damages, if any, be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the global note holder. With respect to notes in
certificated form, we will make all payments of principal, premium, if any, interest and liquidated damages, if
any, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts specified by the holders thereof or, if no
such account is specified, by mailing a check to each such holder’s registered address. Certificated notes may

103


-----

be surrendered for payment at the offices of the Trustee or, so long as the notes are listed on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, the Paying Agent in Luxembourg on the maturity date of the notes. We expect that
secondary trading in any certificated notes will also be settled in immediately available funds.

**PRIVATE PLACEMENT**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the ‘‘Purchase Agreement’’)
between us and the initial purchasers, we have agreed to sell to the initial purchasers, and the initial
purchasers have agreed, severally, to purchase from us, all of the notes.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by its
counsel.

The initial purchasers have agreed to resell the notes (a) to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and
(b) outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. See ‘‘Notice to
Investors.’’ The notes will initially be offered at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial
offering of the notes, the offering price and other selling terms of the notes may from time to time be varied
by the initial purchasers.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may
be required to make in respect thereof.

Prior to this offering, there has been no active market for the notes. We have applied for the notes to be
listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend
to make a market in the notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not
obligated, however, to make a market in the notes and any such market making may be discontinued at any
time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity
of, or trading markets for, the notes.

In connection with this offering, certain persons participating in this offering may engage in transactions
that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may bid
for and purchase notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the notes. The initial purchasers may also
overallot this offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase notes in the open
market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and purchase notes
in market making transactions and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the
respective market price of the notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The initial purchasers are
not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.

The initial purchasers or their affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in
the future investment banking, commercial lending and financial advisory services to us and our affiliates in
the ordinary course of business. Deutsche Bank AG, an affiliate of one of the initial purchasers, is the
administrative agent, and affiliates of the initial purchasers are lenders under our subsidiaries’ new credit
facility.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**United States Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of some material United States federal income tax considerations
relevant to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the notes offered by this memorandum, but does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax considerations relating to the notes. This summary is
based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), Treasury regulations, rulings of
the Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’) and judicial decisions in existence on the date hereof, all of which
are subject to change. Any such change could apply retroactively and could affect adversely the tax
consequences described below. No advance tax ruling has been sought or obtained from the IRS regarding the
tax consequences of the transactions described herein.

For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Person is:

) an individual who is a citizen of the United States or who is resident in the United States for United
States federal income tax purposes;

) a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes), that is organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof;

) an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

) a trust that is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States and is subject to the
control of one or more United States persons as described in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, or that
has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States
person.

For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the notes who or which is a
U.S. Person and a Non-U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the notes other than a U.S. Holder.

This summary does not discuss all United States federal tax considerations, such as estate and gift tax
consequences to U.S. Holders, that may be relevant to a Holder in light of its particular circumstances. This
summary does not address the federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to certain Holders that
may be subject to special treatment (including, without limitation, Holders subject to the alternative minimum
tax, banks, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, small business investment
companies, partnerships or other pass-through entities, dealers in securities or currencies, broker-dealers,
persons who hold shares as part of a straddle, hedging, constructive sale, or conversion transaction, and
U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar). Furthermore, this summary does not address
any aspects of state, local or other taxation. This summary is limited to those Holders who purchase notes in
the initial offering at the initial offering price and who hold notes as ‘‘capital assets’’ within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code. In the case of any Non-U.S. Holder who is an individual, the following discussion
assumes that this individual was not a former United States citizen, and was not formerly a resident of the
United States for United States federal income tax purposes.

If a partnership (including for this purposes any entity treated as a partnership for United States federal
income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of the notes, the treatment of a partner in the partnership will
generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. A Holder of notes
that is a partnership and partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors about the United States
federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of the notes.

**This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, and should not be construed**
**to be, legal, business or tax advice to any particular Holder. Prospective investors are urged to consult**
**their tax advisors regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of acquiring, holding**
**and disposing of the notes as well as any tax consequences that may arise under the laws of any foreign,**
**state, local or other taxing jurisdiction.**

105


-----

_Consequences to U.S. Holders_

_Stated Interest._ Stated interest on the notes will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the
time the interest accrues or is received in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for United
States federal income tax purposes.

We intend to take the position for United States federal income tax purposes that any additional interest
on the notes as a result of a registration default and any redemption premium paid upon a change in control
should be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income when received or accrued in accordance with the
U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for federal income tax purposes. This position is based in part on our
determination that, as of the date of issuance of the notes, the possibility that such additional payments will
actually be made is a ‘‘remote’’ or ‘‘incidental’’ contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury
regulations. Our determination that the possibility is a remote or incidental contingency is binding on each
U.S. Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS, on its federal income tax return for the
year during which the note is acquired, that the U.S. Holder is taking a different position. Regardless of our
position, however, the IRS may assert that the possibility that such additional payments will actually be made
is not a remote or incidental contingency. If such an assertion by the IRS is successful, the timing and
character of the U.S. Holder’s income from the notes may be affected.

The interest on the notes will be paid in euros rather than in United States dollars. In general, a
U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of accounting will be required to include in income the United States
dollar value of the amount of interest income received, whether or not the payment is received in United
States dollars or converted into United States dollars. The United States dollar value of the amount of interest
received is the amount of foreign currency interest paid, translated at the spot rate on the date of receipt. The
U.S. Holder will not have exchange gain or loss on the interest payment, but may have exchange gain or loss
when the U.S. Holder disposes of any foreign currency received.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting is generally required to include in income the
United States dollar value of interest accrued during the accrual period. Accrual basis U.S. Holders may
determine the amount of income recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two
methods. Under the first method, the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest is translated at the average rate for
the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the average rate
for the partial period within the taxable year). For this purpose, the average rate is the simple average of spot
rates of exchange for each business day of such period or other average exchange rate for the period
reasonably derived and consistently applied by the U.S. Holder. Under the second method, a U.S. Holder can
elect to accrue interest at the spot rate on the last day of an interest accrual period (in the case of a partial
accrual period, the last day of the taxable year) or, if the last day of an interest accrual period is within five
business days of the receipt or payment, the spot rate on the date of receipt or payment. Any such election
will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder both at the beginning of the first taxable year to
which the election applies and thereafter acquired, and may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS.
An accrual basis U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss on the receipt of a foreign currency
interest payment if the exchange rate on the date payment is received differs from the rate applicable to the
previous accrual of that interest income. The foreign currency gain or loss of a U.S. Holder will generally be
treated as United States sourced ordinary income or loss.

_Original Issue Discount._ If the stated redemption price at maturity of a note exceeds its ‘‘issue price,’’
the excess is treated as original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) that is taxable to the holder as ordinary income on a
current basis. However, if the amount of this excess is less than a specified de minimis amount (generally
0.25% of the product of the stated redemption price at maturity and the number of complete years to maturity
from the date of issue) the OID will be treated as zero. The issue price of the notes is the price paid by the
first buyer of such notes.

The issue price of the notes is expected to be the amount set forth on the cover page of this offering
memorandum, but is subject to change based on the actual sale of the notes. Because the stated redemption
price of the notes is not expected to exceed the issue price by more than the specified de minimis amount,
any de minimis OID on the notes will not be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income on a current basis

106


-----

(unless the U.S. Holder makes an affirmative election to accrue such de minimis OID and all stated interest
into income on a constant yield basis). The remainder of this discussion assumes that there will not be OID
on the notes.

_Disposition of Notes._ In the case of a sale or other disposition (including a retirement) of a note, a
U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received (other
than any amount representing accrued but unpaid stated interest, which is taxable as ordinary income) and the
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal
the U.S. Holder’s cost of the note in United States dollars, reduced by the amount in United States dollars of
any payments (other than stated interest) made on such note . Except as described below with respect to
currency exchange gain or loss, gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition of a
note generally will constitute capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers from the sale or
other disposition of a note held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of United States federal
income taxation. The deductibility of a capital loss realized on the sale or other disposition of a note may be
subject to limitations.

With respect to the sale or other disposition (including a retirement) of a note denominated in euros, the
amount realized in euros will be considered to be (1) first, the payment of accrued but unpaid interest (on
which exchange gain or loss will be recognized as described in the section entitled ‘‘Stated Interest’’ above),
and (2) second, a payment of principal. With respect to such payment of principal, gain or loss will be
computed in euros and translated on the date of sale or other disposition. Additionally, exchange gain or loss
will be separately computed in euros on the amount of principal to the extent that the rate of exchange on the
date of sale or other disposition differs from the rate of exchange on the date the note was acquired.
Exchange gain or loss computed on accrued interest and principal will be realized, however, only to the
extent of total gain or loss realized on the transaction.

In the case of a note denominated in euros, the cost of the note to the U.S. Holder will be the United
States dollar value of the purchase price in euros translated at the spot rate for the date of purchase. The
conversion of United States dollars into euros and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a note
generally will not result in a taxable gain or loss for a U.S. Holder.

_Disposition of Euros._ A U.S. Holder will have a tax basis in any euros received as interest on a note,
or received on the sale or other disposition of a note, equal to the United States dollar value of such euros on
the date of receipt. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition of such euros
will be ordinary income or loss.

_Exchange of Notes._ The exchange of notes for Exchange Notes in the Exchange Offer will not
constitute a taxable event for U.S. Holders. As a result, (1) a U.S. Holder should not recognize taxable gain
or loss as a result of exchanging notes for Exchange Notes pursuant to the exchange offer, (2) the holding
period of the Exchange Notes should include the holding period of the notes exchanged, and (3) the adjusted
tax basis of the Exchange Notes should be the same as the adjusted tax basis of the notes exchanged
immediately before such exchange.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting._ We, our paying agent or a broker may be required to
provide the IRS with certain information, including the name, address and taxpayer identification number of
U.S. Holders, the aggregate amount of principal and interest (and premium, if any) and sales proceeds paid to
that Holder during the calendar year, and the amount of tax withheld, if any. This obligation, however, does
not apply with respect to certain U.S. Holders including corporations, tax-exempt organizations, qualified
pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts. In the event that a U.S. Holder subject to
the reporting requirements described above fails to supply its correct taxpayer identification number in the
manner required by applicable law or is notified by the IRS that it has failed to properly report payments of
interest and dividends, we, our paying agent or a broker may be required to ‘‘backup’’ withhold tax (at a rate
equal to 30% for tax years beginning before January 1, 2004, 29% for tax years beginning between
January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2006, and 28% for tax years beginning on January 1, 2006 and
thereafter) on each payment of interest and principal (and premium, if any) and sales proceeds on or with
respect to the notes.

107


-----

Backup withholding is not an additional tax; any amounts so withheld may be credited against the
United States federal income tax liability of the Holder or refunded if the amounts withheld exceed such
liability, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.

_Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders_

_Interest Income._ Interest earned on a note by a Non-U.S. Holder will be considered ‘‘portfolio
interest,’’ and will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding, if:

) the certification requirements described generally below are satisfied and the Non-U.S. Holder is not
(i) a ‘‘controlled foreign corporation’’ that is related to us as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the
Code, (ii) a bank receiving the interest on a loan made in the ordinary course of its business, or (iii) a
person who owns, directly or under the attribution rules of Section 871(h)(3)(C) of the Code, 10% or
more of the total combined voting power of all our stock;

) the interest is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United
States by the Non-U.S. Holder; and

) we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the beneficial Holder is a U.S. Person and we
can reliably associate the interest payment with the certification documents provided to us.

The certification requirements will be satisfied if either (i) the beneficial owner of the note timely
certifies to us or our paying agent, under penalties of perjury, that such owner is a Non-U.S. Holder and
provides its name and address, or (ii) a custodian, broker, nominee, or other intermediary acting as an agent
for the beneficial owner (such as a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that
holds customers’ securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business) that holds the notes in such
capacity timely certifies to us or our paying agent, under penalties of perjury, that such statement has been
received from the beneficial owner of the notes by such intermediary, or by any other financial institution
between such intermediary and the beneficial owner, and furnishes to us or our paying agent a copy thereof.
The foregoing certification may be provided on a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8IMY, as
applicable, or any successor forms, duly executed under penalties of perjury. With respect to the certification
requirement for notes that are held by an entity that is classified for United States federal income tax
purposes as a foreign partnership, the applicable Treasury Regulations provide that, unless the foreign
partnership has entered into a withholding agreement with the IRS, the foreign partnership will be required,
in addition to providing an intermediary Form W-8IMY, to attach an appropriate certification by each partner.

Any interest earned on a note, and any gain realized on a sale or other disposition (including a
retirement) of a note, that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United
States by a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to United States federal income tax at regular graduated rates as
if the Non-U.S Holder were a U.S. Holder. In addition, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, the Non-U.S.
Holder may also be subject to a 30% branch profits tax (unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable treaty)
imposed on any such effectively connected earnings and profits. However, such income will not be subject to
United States federal income tax withholding, if the Non-U.S. Holder furnishes a properly completed IRS
Form W-8ECI to us or our paying agent.

Any payments to a Non-U.S. Holder of interest that do not qualify for the ‘‘portfolio interest’’
exemption, and that are not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United
States by the Non-U.S. Holder, will be subject to United States federal income tax and withholding at a rate
of 30% (or at a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty).

_Disposition of Notes._ Any gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition
(including a retirement) of a note will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding if
(i) the gain is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States by
the Non-U.S. Holder, and (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder who is an individual, such individual is not
present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, or the
individual does not have a ‘‘tax home’’ in the United States and the gain is not attributable to an office or
other fixed place of business maintained in the United States by the individual.

108


-----

_Estate Tax Consequences._ Any note that is owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident (as
specially defined for United States federal estate tax purposes) of the United States at the date of death will
not be included in such individual’s estate for United States federal estate tax purposes, unless the individual
owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of all our stock, or, at the time of such
individual’s death, payments in respect of the notes would have been effectively connected with the conduct
by such individual of a trade or business in the United States.

_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting._ We must report annually to the IRS and to each NonU.S. Holder any interest on the notes that is subject to withholding or that is exempt from U.S. withholding
tax pursuant to a tax treaty or the ‘‘portfolio interest’’ exemption. Copies of these information returns may
also be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the
country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides.

In the case of payments of principal on the notes, backup withholding and information reporting will not
apply if the holder has made the requisite certification, described in the section entitled ‘‘Interest Income’’
above or otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that neither we nor our paying agent has actual
knowledge that (i) the holder is a U.S. Holder, or (ii) the conditions of any other exemption are not, in fact,
satisfied.

The payment of the proceeds on the disposition of a note to or through the U.S. office of a broker
generally will be subject to information reporting and potential backup withholding unless a holder either
certifies its status as a Non-U.S. Holder under penalties of perjury on IRS Form W-8BEN (or a suitable
substitute form) and meets certain other conditions or otherwise establishes an exemption. If the foreign office
of a foreign broker (as defined in applicable Treasury regulations) pays the proceeds of the sale of a note to
the seller thereof, backup withholding and information reporting generally will not apply. Information
reporting requirements (but not backup withholding) will apply, however, to a payment of the proceeds of the
sale of a note by (1) a foreign office of a custodian, nominee, other agent or broker that is a U.S. Person,
(2) a foreign custodian, nominee, other agent or broker that derives 50% or more of its gross income for
certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (3) a foreign custodian, nominee,
other agent or broker that is a controlled foreign corporation for United States federal income tax purposes or
(4) a foreign partnership if at any time during its tax year one or more of its partners are U.S. Persons who,
in the aggregate, hold more than 50% of the income or capital interest of the partnership or if, at any time
during its taxable year, the partnership is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United
States, unless the custodian, nominee, other agent, broker or foreign partnership has documentary evidence in
its records that the holder is not a U.S. Person and certain other conditions are met or the holder otherwise
establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax; any amounts so withheld may be credited against the
United States federal income tax liability of the holder or refunded if the amounts withheld exceed such
liability, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.

**Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of some of the material Luxembourg income tax consequences
relevant to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the notes offered by this offering memorandum for a
non-resident Holder of a note. This summary is based on Luxembourg laws, regulations, rulings and decisions
now in effect, all of which are subject to change.

**This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, and should not be construed**
**to be, legal, business or tax advice to any particular Holder. Prospective investors are urged to consult**
**their tax advisors regarding the Luxembourg income tax consequences of acquiring, holding and**
**disposing of the notes as well as any tax consequences that may arise under the laws of any foreign,**
**state, local or other taxing jurisdiction.**

109


-----

_Withholding Tax_

Under Luxembourg tax laws currently in effect, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal,
interest, accrued but unpaid interest or accretions of yield to maturity in respect of the notes, nor is any
Luxembourg withholding tax payable by such Holders on redemption or repurchase of the notes. There is no
income tax due upon redemption or repurchase of, or on capital gains on the sale of, any notes held by a
non-resident, as long as the notes are not held through a permanent establishment in Luxembourg.

No stamp, value added, registration or similar taxes or duties will, under present Luxembourg law, be
payable in Luxembourg by the Holders of notes in connection with the issuance of the notes.

**German Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary of some of the material German income tax consequences
relevant to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of notes for a resident and non-resident Holder of a
note. This summary is based on German laws, regulations, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which
are subject to change.

**This summary is of a general nature only and is not intended to be, and should not be construed**
**to be, legal, business or tax advice to any particular holder. Prospective investors are urged to consult**
**their tax advisors regarding the German income, trade and solidarity tax consequences of acquiring,**
**holding and disposing of the notes as well as any tax consequences that may arise under the laws of any**
**foreign, state, local or other taxing jurisdiction.**

_Tax Residents_

Payments of interest on the notes, including interest having accrued up to the sale of a note and credited
separately (‘‘Accrued Interest’’) to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons whose residence,
habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control is located in Germany) are subject
to German corporate income tax (plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon (Solidaritaetszurschlag)). Such
interest is also subject to trade tax if the notes form part of the property of a German trade or business.

Any OID in excess of certain threshold amounts is taxed as interest income in the year the note is sold
or redeemed, provided the note can be classified as a financial innovation (Finanzinnovation), including,
among other things, zero coupon notes or discounted notes. However, if the note is part of property of a trade
or business in Germany, the OID amount must be taken into account pro rata as interest income over the
term of the note and may also be subject to trade tax. Because the stated redemption price of the notes is not
expected to exceed the issue price by more than a de minimis amount, no portion of the OID, if any, on the
notes will be taxable to a German Holder as interest income on a current or amortized basis. The remainder
of this discussion assumes that there will not be OID on the notes.

Capital gains from the disposal of notes by German-resident corporate Holders of notes will be subject
to corporate income tax (plus a solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon) and trade tax.

If the notes are held in a custodial account that the holder maintains with a German branch of a German
or non-German financial or financial services institution (the ‘‘Disbursing Agent’’), a 30% withholding tax on
interest payments (Zinsabschlagstieuer), plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge on such tax, will be levied, resulting
in a total tax charge of 31.65% of the gross interest payment. Withholding tax is also imposed on Accrued
Interest.

In computing the tax to be withheld, the Disbursing Agent may deduct from the basis of the withholding
tax any Accrued Interest paid by the holder of a note to the Disbursing Agent during the same calendar year.
No withholding tax will be deducted if the holder of the note has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a
certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the relevant local tax office.

Withholding tax and the solidarity surcharge thereon are credited as prepayments against the German
corporate income tax and the solidarity surcharge liability of the German resident. Amounts overwithheld will
entitle the holder to a refund, based on an assessment to tax.

_Nonresidents_

Interest, including Accrued Interest, and capital gains with respect to a note held by a German
nonresident are not subject to German taxation, unless:

(1) the note forms part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a
permanent representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the Holder; or

(2) the interest income otherwise constitutes German-source income (such as income from the
letting and leasing of certain property located in Germany).

In situations (1) and (2), a tax regime similar to that explained above under ‘‘Tax Residents’’ applies.
Capital gains from the disposition of the Notes are, however, only taxable in situation (1).

Nonresidents of Germany are, in general, exempt from German withholding tax on interest and the
solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest is subject to German taxation as set forth in the
preceding paragraph and the Notes are held in a custodial account with a disbursing agent, withholding tax is
levied as explained above under ‘‘Tax Residents.’’

**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS**

To the Board of Directors and Common Stockholder of Kronos International, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, redeemable preferred stock, profit participation certificates and common
stockholder’s equity (deficit) and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Kronos International, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1, the accompanying financial statements exclude the accounts of Kronos Canada,
Inc., formerly a wholly owned subsidiary that was sold to Kronos, Inc. on April 30, 2002.

**KRONOS INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Note 1 — Organization and Basis of Presentation:**

Kronos International, Inc. (‘‘KII’’) is incorporated in the state of Delaware, U.S.A., with its seat of
management in Leverkusen, Germany. KII is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kronos, Inc. (‘‘Kronos’’), a
wholly owned subsidiary of NL Industries, Inc. (‘‘NL’’). NL conducts its titanium dioxide pigments (‘‘TiO2’’)
operations through Kronos. At April 30, 2002 and March 31, 2002, Valhi, Inc. (‘‘Valhi’’) and Tremont
Corporation (‘‘Tremont’’), each affiliates of Contran Corporation (‘‘Contran’’), held approximately 62% and
21%, respectively, of NL’s outstanding common stock. Valhi and Tremont held approximately 61% and 21%,
respectively, of NL’s outstanding common stock at December 31, 2001. At April 30, 2002, March 31, 2002
and December 31, 2001, Contran and its subsidiaries held approximately 94% of Valhi’s outstanding common
stock, and a company 80%-owned by Valhi and 20%-owned by NL held approximately 80% of Tremont’s
outstanding common stock. Substantially all of Contran’s outstanding voting stock is held by trusts
established for the benefit of certain children and grandchildren of Harold C. Simmons, of which
Mr. Simmons is the sole trustee. Mr. Simmons, the Chairman of the Board of NL and the Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Contran and Valhi and a director of Tremont, may be deemed to control
each of such companies and KII.

KII’s current operations are conducted primarily through its German, Belgian and Norwegian subsidiaries
with three TiO2 plants in Germany, one TiO2 plant in Belgium and one TiO2 plant and an ilmenite ore mining
operation in Norway. KII also operates TiO2 sales and distribution facilities in England, France, Denmark and
the Netherlands. Prior to April 30, 2002, KII also conducted operations in Canada through Kronos Canada,
Inc. (‘‘KC’’), its wholly owned subsidiary. Effective April 30, 2002, in anticipation of a proposed debt
securities offering, KII sold 100% of KC’s capital stock to Kronos in exchange for a promissory note
receivable in the amount of $217 million bearing interest of 7.87% per annum with a maturity date of
April 30, 2012. KII has accounted for the disposition of KC as a change in accounting entity. Accordingly,
KII’s consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to exclude the assets, liabilities, results
of operations and cash flows of KC for all periods presented. KII’s cash dividends received from KC and
cash capital contributions to KC prior to April 30, 2002 are reflected as part of ‘‘other capital transactions
with affiliates, net’’ in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows. The effect of the change in
accounting entity as a result of the sale of KC to Kronos was to reduce KII’s net income by the following
amounts:

**(In thousands)**
Net income ********************************************** $11,365 $14,155 $10,133

Information included in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated
financial statements as of April 30, 2002 and March 31, 2002 and for the four months ended April 30, 2002
and 2001, and the three months ended March 31, 2002 and 2001 is unaudited. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the information for
the interim periods have been made. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of the operating results for a full year or of future operations. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the U.S. (‘‘GAAP’’) have been condensed or omitted for the interim periods.

**Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:**

**_Principles of Consolidation and Management’s Estimates_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KII and its majority-owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘‘Company’’). All material intercompany accounts and balances have been

F-10


-----

eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under
different assumptions or conditions.

**_Translation of Foreign Currencies_**

The functional currencies of the Company include the euro, the Norwegian kroner and the United
Kingdom pound sterling. Assets and liabilities of the Company are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end rates
of exchange and revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates prevailing during
the year. Resulting translation adjustments are included in other comprehensive income (loss), net of related
income taxes. Currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in income currently and include amounts
related to KII’s U.S. dollar-denominated note payable to Kronos that has been remeasured into the
non-U.S. dollar functional currency of KII. See Note 8.

**_Cash Equivalents_**

Cash equivalents include bank deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally average cost) or market. Amounts are removed
from inventories at average cost.

**_Property, Equipment, Depreciation and Depletion_**

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Interest costs related to major, long-term capital projects are
capitalized as a component of construction costs. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals
are expensed; expenditures for major improvements are capitalized.

Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of ten to
forty years for buildings and three to twenty years for machinery and equipment. Depletion of mining
properties is computed by the unit-of-production and straight-line methods.

When events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets may be impaired, an evaluation is
performed to determine if an impairment exists. Such events or changes in circumstances include, among
other things, (i) significant current and prior periods or current and projected periods with operating losses,
(ii) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or (iii) a significant change in the extent or manner
in which an asset is used. All relevant factors are considered. The test for impairment is performed by
comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows (exclusive of interest expense) associated with the
asset to the asset’s net carrying value to determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash flow
value is required. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company assesses the impairment of other long-lived assets
(such as property and equipment and mining properties) in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (‘‘SFAS’’) No. 144 as discussed under ‘‘Other’’ below.

**_Long-Term Debt and Notes Payable to Affiliates_**

Where applicable, long-term debt and notes payable to affiliates are stated net of unamortized original
issue discount (‘‘OID’’). OID is amortized over the period during which cash interest payments are not
required and deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the applicable issue, both by the interest
method.

F-11


-----

**_Employee Benefit Plans_**

Accounting and funding policies for retirement plans are described in Note 10.

The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion (‘‘APBO’’) No. 25, ‘‘Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,’’ and its various
interpretations. Under APBO No. 25, no compensation cost is generally recognized for fixed stock options in
which the exercise price is not less than the market price on the grant date. Compensation cost recognized by
the Company in accordance with APBO No. 25 was nil in each of 1999, 2000 and 2001. The Company is
charged by NL for stock options exercised by employees of the Company and the amount of expense
recognized by the Company was nil, $.2 million and nil in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. See Note 17.

**_Environmental Remediation Costs_**

Environmental remediation costs are accrued when estimated future expenditures are probable and
reasonably estimable. The estimated future expenditures generally are not discounted to present value.
Recoveries of remediation costs from other parties, if any, are reported as receivables when their receipt is
deemed probable. At December 31, 2000 and 2001, no receivables for recoveries have been recognized.

**_Net Sales_**

The Company adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (‘‘SEC’’) Staff Accounting Bulletin
(‘‘SAB’’) No. 101, ‘‘Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,’’ as amended, in 2000. Revenue generally
is realized or realizable and earned when all of the requirements of SAB No. 101 are met, including when
title and the risks and rewards of ownership passes to the customer (generally at the time the product is
shipped to the customer). The impact of adopting SAB No. 101 was not material. Fees charged to customers
for shipping and handling are included in net sales.

**_Repair and Maintenance Costs_**

The Company performs planned major maintenance activities throughout the year. Repair and
maintenance costs estimated to be incurred in connection with planned major maintenance activities are
accrued in advance and are included in cost of goods sold.

**_Shipping and Handling Costs_**

Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expense and were
$37 million in 1999, $33 million in each of 2000 and 2001, $8.5 million and $8.4 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, and $11.2 million and $10.3 million for the four months ended
April 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

**_Income Taxes_**

KII is a member of NL’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax group (the ‘‘NL Tax Group’’). KII is a
party to a U.S. federal income tax sharing agreement (the ‘‘Kronos Tax Agreement’’). Effective January 1,
2001, the NL Tax Group, including KII, are included in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax group of
Contran (the ‘‘Contran Tax Group’’). As a member of the Contran Tax Group, NL is a party to a separate tax
sharing agreement (the ‘‘Contran Tax Agreement’’). The Contran Tax Agreement provides that NL calculate
its liability for U.S. income taxes on a separate-company basis using the tax elections made by Contran.
During 2002 the Kronos Tax Agreement was amended (the ‘‘Amended Kronos Tax Agreement’’). The
Amended Kronos Tax Agreement provides that Kronos calculate KII’s liability for U.S. income taxes on a
separate-company basis using tax elections consistent with Kronos’ tax elections. Pursuant to the Amended
Kronos Tax Agreement, KII is to make distributions to or receive contributions from Kronos in the amounts
it would have paid to or received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service had it not been a member of the
NL Tax Group, but rather a separate taxpayer. Contributions under the Amended Kronos Tax Agreement are
limited to amounts previously distributed under the agreement. No distributions have yet been made or

F-12


-----

received under the Amended Kronos Tax Agreement. KII would not have reported a different provision for
income taxes in 1999, 2000 and 2001 if the provision for income taxes in such periods had been computed in
accordance with the tax allocation policy contained in the Amended Kronos Tax Agreement.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities, including investments in subsidiaries not included in the NL Tax Group. The Company periodically
evaluates its deferred tax assets in the various taxing jurisdictions in which it operates and adjusts any related
valuation allowance. The Company’s valuation allowance is equal to the amount of deferred tax assets which
the Company believes do not meet the ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ recognition criteria.

**_Derivatives and Hedging Activities_**

The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, ‘‘Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,’’
as amended, effective January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.
Under SFAS No. 133, all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
The accounting for changes in fair value of derivatives is dependent upon the intended use of the derivative.
As permitted by the transition requirements of SFAS No. 133, as amended, the Company exempted from the
scope of SFAS No. 133 all host contracts containing embedded derivatives which were issued or acquired
prior to January 1, 1999. The Company is not a party to any significant derivative or hedging instrument
covered by SFAS No. 133 at December 31, 2001, and there was no impact on the Company’s financial
statements from adopting SFAS No. 133.

The Company periodically uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and other types of contracts to
manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk with respect to financial assets or liabilities. The Company has
not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past, nor does it currently anticipate
doing so in the future. The Company was not a party to any such contracts during 1999, 2000 and 2001.

**_Other_**

Effective July 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 141, ‘‘Business Combinations,’’ for all business
combinations initiated on or after July 1, 2001, and all purchase business combinations (including step
acquisitions). Under SFAS No. 141, all business combinations will be accounted for by the purchase method,
and the pooling-of-interests method will be prohibited.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 144, ‘‘Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,’’ effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions of existing GAAP with
respect to the recognition and measurement of long-lived asset impairment contained in SFAS No. 121,
‘‘Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of.’’
However, SFAS No. 144 provides new guidance intended to address certain significant implementation issues
associated with SFAS No. 121, including expanded guidance with respect to appropriate cash flows to be used
to determine whether recognition of any long-lived asset impairment is required, and if required how to
measure the amount of the impairment. SFAS No. 144 also requires that any net assets to be disposed of by
sale to be reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and expands the reporting of
discontinued operations to include any component of an entity with operations and cash flows that can be
clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002 did
not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

**_New Accounting Principles Not Yet Adopted_**

The Company will adopt SFAS No. 143, ‘‘Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,’’ no later than
January 1, 2003. Under SFAS No. 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation covered
under the scope of SFAS No. 143 would be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred, with
an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability would be
accreted to its present value, and the capitalized cost would be depreciated over the useful life of the related

F-13


-----

asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity would either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or
incur a gain or loss upon settlement. The Company is still studying this standard to determine, among other
things, whether it has any asset retirement obligations which are covered under the scope of SFAS No. 143,
and the effect, if any, to the Company of adopting SFAS No. 143 has not yet been determined.

**Note 3 — Business and Geographic Segments:**

The Company’s operations are conducted in one operating business segment — the production and sale
of TiO2. Titanium dioxide pigments are used to whiten, brighten and add opacity to thousands of commonly
used products, such as paints, plastics and paper, as well as fibers, rubber, ceramics, inks and cosmetics. All
of the Company’s net assets are located in Europe and are attributable to the TiO2 reportable operating
segment.

The Company evaluates its TiO2 segment performance based on operating income. Operating income is
defined as income before income taxes, minority interest, interest expense, interest expense to affiliates,
certain nonrecurring items and certain general corporate items. Corporate items excluded from operating
income include corporate expense, interest income from affiliates, gains and losses from the disposal of longlived assets outside the ordinary course of business, and currency transaction gains and losses related to KII’s
U.S. dollar-denominated note payable to Kronos discussed in Note 8. The accounting policies of the TiO2
segment are the same as those described in Note 2. Interest income included in the calculation of TiO2
operating income is disclosed in Note 11 as ‘‘Trade interest income.’’

rates on the euro-denominated note payable and the Norwegian kroner-denominated note payable were 5.33%
and 7.92% at December 31, 2000, 3.84% and 7.27% at December 31, 2001, 3.84% and 7.17% at March 31,
2002, and 4.00% and 7.29% at April 30, 2002, respectively.

Unused lines of credit available for borrowing under the Company’s non-U.S. credit facilities
approximated $8 million at December 31, 2001, March 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002.

$194,000 $480,363 $451,800 $270,000

NL had $194 million of 11.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2003 (the ‘‘Notes’’) at December 31, 2000
and 2001 ($169 million at March 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002). KII has a Second-Tier Senior Mirror Note
(the ‘‘KII Mirror Note’’) payable to Kronos, which has a First-Tier Senior Mirror Note (the ‘‘Kronos Mirror
Note’’) payable to NL. The terms of the KII Mirror Note and the Kronos Mirror Note are identical to the
terms of the Notes with respect to the maturity dates and interest rates with interest paid semi-annually. The
Notes are collateralized by a first priority lien on the common stock, and redeemable preferred stock and
profit participation certificates of KII, the KII Mirror Note, the Kronos Mirror Note and other collateral
pledged by NL and Kronos. An acceleration with respect to the principal amount of the Notes will result in
an automatic acceleration of the KII Mirror Note and the Kronos Mirror Note. In 2000 NL redeemed

F-16


-----

$50 million (par value) of the Notes using cash provided by KII, prepaying $50 million (par value) of the KII
Mirror Note. On March 22, 2002, NL redeemed $25 million principal amount of the Notes at the current call
price of 100%, and as a result $25 million principal amount of the KII Mirror Note was repaid.

The indenture pursuant to which NL issued the Notes contains a number of covenants and restrictions
which, among other things, restricts the ability of the Company to incur debt, incur liens, merge or
consolidate with, or sell or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to another entity.

The quoted market price of the Notes per $100 principal amount was $101, $101.73 and $100.58
December 31, 2000, March 31, 2001 and April 30, 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2001, March 31,
2002 and April 30, 2002 the quoted market price of the Notes per $100 principal amount was $100.47,
$100.35 and $100.34, respectively, which the Company believes is a reasonable approximation of the fair
value of the KII Mirror Note for the periods presented.

The euro-denominated note payable to Kronos (4323.9 million, 4328.6 million and 4112.7 million at
December 31, 2001, March 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002, respectively) is due in 2010 and bears interest at
6% payable monthly. The euro note payable to Kronos was established in 2001 as a result of a series of
noncash transactions between KII, NL and Kronos. A portion of the note payable (4217.6 million, including
interest of 46.3 million) was prepaid in April 2002, using as consideration an equivalent amount of KII’s
euro-denominated note receivable from NL. See Note 17.

**Note 10 — Employee Benefit Plans:**

**_Company-Sponsored Pension Plans_**

The Company maintains various defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees.
Personnel are covered by plans in their respective countries.

Certain actuarial assumptions used in measuring the defined benefit pension assets, liabilities and
expenses are presented below.

**Years Ended December 31,**
**1999** **2000** **2001**
**(Percentages)**
Discount rate *************************************** 5.8 to 6.3 6.0 to 6.5 5.8 to 7.3

Long-term rate of return on plan assets ***************** 6.0 to 9.0 7.0 to 8.0 6.8 to 7.8

Plan assets are comprised primarily of investments in corporate equity and debt securities, short-term
investments, mutual funds and group annuity contracts.

SFAS No. 87, ‘‘Employers’ Accounting for Pension Costs’’ requires that an additional pension liability
be recognized when the unfunded accumulated pension benefit obligation exceeds the unfunded accrued
pension liability. Variances from actuarially assumed rates will change the actuarial valuation of accrued
pension liabilities, pension expense and funding requirements in future periods.

Certain of the Company’s tax returns in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions are being examined and
tax authorities have proposed or may propose tax deficiencies, including penalties and interest.

A reduction in the German ‘‘base’’ income tax rate from 30% to 25%, enacted in October 2000, became
effective January 1, 2001. The reduction in the German income tax rate resulted in $5.7 million of additional
deferred income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2000 due to a reduction of the Company’s deferred
income tax asset related to certain German tax attributes. The Company does not expect its future current
income tax expense to be affected by the rate change in Germany.

The Company received tax assessments from the Norwegian tax authorities proposing tax deficiencies,
including related interest, of NOK 39.3 million pertaining to 1994 and 1996. The Company was unsuccessful
in appealing the tax assessments and in June 2001 paid NOK 39.3 million ($4.3 million when paid) to the
Norwegian tax authorities. The Company was adequately reserved for this contingency. The lien on the
Company’s Fredrikstad, Norway TiO2 plant in favor of the Norwegian tax authorities has been released.

The Company has received preliminary tax assessments for the years 1991 to 1997 from the Belgian tax
authorities proposing tax deficiencies, including related interest, of approximately 410.4 million ($9.2 million
at December 31, 2001, and $9.1 million at both March 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002). The Company has filed
protests to the assessments for the years 1991 to 1997. The Company is in discussions with the Belgian tax
authorities and believes that a significant portion of the assessments is without merit.

No assurance can be given that the Company’s tax matters will be favorably resolved due to the inherent
uncertainties involved in court and tax proceedings. The Company believes that it has provided adequate
accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which may ultimately result from all such
examinations and believes that the ultimate disposition of such examinations should not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recognized a $23.2 million income tax benefit
attributable to a decrease in the valuation allowance due to a change in estimate of the Company’s ability to
utilize certain German income tax attributes that did not previously meet the ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’
recognition criteria.

The Company recognized a $40 million noncash income tax benefit in 1999 comprised of a favorable
resolution of the Company’s tax contingency in Germany ($14 million) and a net reduction in the Company’s
deferred income tax valuation allowance due to a change in estimate of the Company’s ability to utilize
certain income tax attributes under the ‘‘more-likely-than-not’’ recognition criteria ($26 million).

The $26 million net reduction in the Company’s deferred income tax valuation allowance in 1999 is
comprised of (i) a $50 million decrease in the valuation allowance to recognize the benefit of certain
deductible income tax attributes which the Company now believes meet the recognition criteria as a result of,
among other things, a corporate restructuring of the Company’s German subsidiaries offset by (ii) a
$24 million increase in the valuation allowance to reduce the previously recognized benefit of certain other
deductible income tax attributes which the Company now believes do not meet the recognition criteria due to
a change in German tax law.

At December 31, 2001, March 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002 the Company had approximately
$317 million, $312 million and $324 million, respectively, of income tax loss carryforwards in Germany with
no expiration date.

**Note 14 — Leverkusen Fire and Insurance Claim:**

A fire on March 20, 2001 damaged a section of the Company’s Leverkusen, Germany 35,000 metric ton
sulfate-process TiO2 plant (‘‘Sulfate Plant’’) and, as a result, production of TiO2 at the Leverkusen facility
was halted. The fire did not enter the Company’s adjacent 125,000 metric ton chloride-process TiO2 plant
(‘‘Chloride Plant’’), but did damage certain support equipment necessary to operate that plant. The damage to
the support equipment resulted in a temporary shutdown of the Chloride Plant.

On April 8, 2001, repairs to the damaged support equipment were substantially completed and full
production resumed at the Chloride Plant. The Sulfate Plant became approximately 50% operational in
September 2001 and became fully operational in late October 2001. The damages to property and the
business interruption losses caused by the fire were covered by insurance as noted below, but the effect on the
financial results of the Company on a quarter-to-quarter basis was impacted by the timing and amount of
insurance recoveries.

The Company settled its insurance claim involving the Leverkusen fire for approximately $56 million
during the fourth quarter of 2001 ($46 million received as of December 31, 2001, with the remaining
$9.5 million received in January 2002), of which approximately $27 million related to business interruption
and approximately $29 million related to property damage, clean-up costs and other extra expenses. The
Company recognized a $17.5 million pre-tax gain in 2001 related to the property damage recovery after
deducting $11.6 million of clean-up costs and other extra expenses incurred and the carrying value of assets
destroyed in the fire. The gain was excluded from the determination of operating income. The $27 million of
business interruption proceeds recognized in 2001 were allocated between other income, excluding corporate,

which reflects recovery of lost margin ($7 million) and as a reduction of cost of sales to offset unallocated
period costs ($20 million). No additional insurance recoveries related to the Leverkusen fire are expected to
be received and there was no impact on the results of operations of the Company during the first four months
of 2002.

**Note 15 — Related Party Transactions:**

The Company may be deemed to be controlled by Harold C. Simmons. Corporations that may be
deemed to be controlled by or affiliated with Mr. Simmons sometimes engage in (a) intercorporate
transactions such as guarantees, management and expense sharing arrangements, shared fee arrangements, tax
sharing agreements, joint ventures, partnerships, loans, options, advances of funds on open account, and sales,
leases and exchanges of assets, including securities issued by both related and unrelated parties and
(b) common investment and acquisition strategies, business combinations, reorganizations, recapitalizations,
securities repurchases, and purchases and sales (and other acquisitions and dispositions) of subsidiaries,
divisions or other business units, which transactions have involved both related and unrelated parties and have
included transactions which resulted in the acquisition by one related party of a publicly held minority equity
interest in another related party. While no transactions of the type described above are planned or proposed
with respect to the Company other than as set forth in these financial statements, the Company from time to
time considers, reviews and evaluates such transactions and understands that Contran, Valhi, NL, Kronos and
related entities consider, review and evaluate, such transactions. Depending upon the business, tax and other
objectives then relevant, and restrictions under the NL indenture and other agreements, it is possible that the
Company might be a party to one or more such transactions in the future.

It is the policy of the Company to engage in transactions with related parties on terms, in the opinion of
the Company, no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained from unrelated parties.

The Company is a party to a cost sharing agreement with Kronos whereby Kronos provides certain
management, financial, insurance and administrative services to the Company on a fee basis. The Company’s
expense was $.7 million in 1999, $.2 million in 2000 and 2001, $.1 million and $.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, and $.1 million and $.4 million for the four months ended April 30,
2001 and 2002, respectively.

Sales of TiO2 to Kronos (US), Inc. (‘‘KUS’’), an affiliate, were $46.3 million in 1999, $41.1 million in
2000, $32.0 million in 2001, $10.1 million and $14.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and
2002, and $12.1 million and $17.4 million for the four months ended April 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively.
Sales of TiO2 to KC were $10.4 million in 1999, $12.4 million in 2000, $7.2 million in 2001, $3.1 million
and $3.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, and $3.4 million for each of the four
months ended April 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

KUS purchases the rutile and slag feedstock used as a raw material in all of the Company’s chloride
process TiO2 facilities. The Company purchases such feedstock from KUS for use in its facilities for an
amount equal to the amount paid by KUS to the third-party supplier plus a 2.5% administrative fee. Such
feedstock purchases were $88.2 million in 1999, $89.4 million in 2000, $91.5 million in 2001, $18.1 million
and $23.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, and $18.1 million and $23.1 million
in the four months ended April 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

Purchases of TiO2 from KUS were $3.7 million in 1999, $3.9 million in 2000, $1.2 million in 2001,
$1.1 million and nil for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, and $1.2 million and nil for the
four months ended April 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Purchases of TiO2 from KC were $1.1 million in
1999, $3.4 million in 2000, $.1 million in 2001, and nil for the three and four months ended March 31, 2001
and 2002, and April 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

Royalty income received from KC for use of certain of the Company’s intellectual property was
$5.9 million in 1999, $5.8 million in 2000, $5.4 million in 2001, $1.4 million and $1.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2001 and 2002, and $2.0 million and $1.8 million for the four months ended
April 30, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

Interest income from affiliates related to notes receivable from affiliates was $1.6 million in 1999,
$23.1 million in 2000, $36.2 million in 2001, $6.7 million and $8.9 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 and 2002, and $9.0 million and $11.9 million for the four months ended April 30, 2001 and
2002, respectively.

The Company is party to master global NL insurance coverage policies with regard to property, business
interruption, excess liability, and other coverages. The costs associated with these policies aggregated
$2.9 million, $3.1 million and $7.1 million in 1999, 2000 and 2001.

**Note 16 — Redeemable Preferred Stock and Profit Participation Certificates:**

The Company’s redeemable preferred stock and profit participation certificates structure at December 31,
2001 and 2000, March 31, 2002, and April 30, 2002, respectively, is summarized below:

_Preferred Stock — $100 par value; 2,000 Shares Authorized:_

_Series A (February 1999) — 1,000 shares authorized, 738 shares issued and outstanding, designated_
nonvoting cumulative preferred stock, Series A, with an annual dividend rate of $11,354 per share
(cumulative and unpaid dividends of $15.9 million, $24.3 million, $26.4 million and $27.1 million at
December 31, 2000 and 2001, March 31, 2002, and April 30, 2002, respectively), and with liquidation
and redemption preferences of $257,361 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series A
shares ($189.9 million) were issued to Kronos in February 1999 as a result of a capital contribution to
the Company via the reduction of affiliate notes payable to NL and Kronos. The Series A shares may be
redeemed by the Company or Kronos on or after February 1, 2002.

_Series B (February 1999) — 1,000 shares authorized, 647 shares issued and outstanding, designated_
nonvoting cumulative preferred stock, Series B, with an annual dividend rate of $11,347 per share
(cumulative and unpaid dividends of $14.7 million, $22.0 million, $23.9 million and $24.5 million at
December 31, 2000 and 2001, March 31, 2002, and April 30, 2002, respectively) and with liquidation
and redemption preferences of $257,193 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The Series B
shares were issued to Kronos in February 1999 in exchange for Kronos’ contribution to the Company of
its intellectual property and the shares were recorded at carryover basis in accordance with GAAP due to
the common control of the Company and Kronos. The intellectual property was transferred to the

F-25


-----

Company and recorded at Kronos’ carryover basis of zero. Thus, the original basis of the Series B shares
was zero and the shares have been accreted to the redemption value of $166.4 million at March 31, 2002
and April 30, 2002 using the interest method. The Series B shares may be redeemed by the Company or
Kronos on or after February 1, 2002.

Kronos waived its right to redeem the Series A and Series B redeemable preferred stock prior to
November 1, 2003.

_Profit Participation Certificates (‘‘PPCs’’) (December 1999) — DM100 par value: 5,500,000 shares_
authorized, issued and outstanding, designated nonvoting cumulative preferred PPCs, with an annual
dividend of 4% per share based on earnings of the Company and before any common stock dividends to
Kronos. Kronos has waived its right to dividend distributions for all periods presented and through
December 2002. The PPCs were issued to Kronos ($284.3 million) in December 1999 as part of a
recapitalization of the Company. The PPC shares may be redeemed at the Company’s or Kronos’ option
after due notice of one year is given at par value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.

**Note 17 — Capital Stock and Notes Receivable from Affiliates:**

**_Common Stock_**

Common stock — $100 par value: (voting) — 100,000 shares authorized (3,196 shares issued and
outstanding at April 30, 2002, March 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively).

**_Common Stock Options_**

The NL Industries, Inc. 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘‘NL Option Plan’’) provides for the
discretionary grant of restricted common stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights (‘‘SARs’’) and other
incentive compensation to officers and other key employees of the Company. Although certain stock options
granted pursuant to a similar plan which preceded the NL Option Plan (‘‘Predecessor Option Plan’’) remain
outstanding at December 31, 2001, no additional options may be granted under the Predecessor Option Plan.

Up to five million shares of NL common stock may be issued pursuant to the NL Option Plan and, at
December 31, 2001, 3,663,000 shares were available for future grants. The NL Option Plan provides for the
grant of options that qualify as incentive options and for options which are not so qualified. Generally, stock
options and SARs (collectively, ‘‘options’’) are granted at a price equal to or greater than 100% of the
market price at the date of grant, vest over a five year period and expire ten years from the date of grant.
Restricted stock, forfeitable unless certain periods of employment are completed, is held in escrow in the
name of the grantee until the restriction period expires. No SARs have been granted under the NL Option
Plan.

At December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 options to purchase 12,600, 7,200 and 17,500 shares,
respectively, were exercisable and options to purchase 26,400 shares become exercisable in 2002. Of the
exercisable options, options to purchase 12,400 shares at December 31, 2001 had exercise prices less than
NL’s December 31, 2001 quoted market price of $15.27 per share. Outstanding options at December 31,
2001 expire at various dates through 2011, with a weighted-average remaining life of eight years.

The pro forma information required by SFAS No. 123, ‘‘Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,’’ is
based on an estimation of the fair value of options issued subsequent to January 1, 1995. The weightedaverage fair values of options granted during 1999, 2000 and 2001 were $6.94, $4.83 and $7.52 per share,
respectively. The fair values of employee stock options were calculated using the Black-Scholes stock option
valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions for grants in 1999, 2000 and 2001: stock
price volatility of 50%, 48% and 46% in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively; risk-free rate of return of 6% in
1999 and 5% in 2000 and 2001; dividend yield of 1.2% in 1999, 4.9% in 2000 and 4.0% in 2001; and an
expected term of 9 years in 1999, 2000 and 2001. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair
value of the options is amortized to expense over the options’ vesting period.

The Company’s pro forma net income available to common stock was as follows.

**_Notes Receivable from Affiliates_**

Long-term notes receivable from affiliates were included as a component of equity in accordance with
GAAP as settlement of these affiliate notes receivable balances is not currently contemplated within the
foreseeable future. The notes are summarized in the following table.

The 6.0% fixed-rate euro-denominated note receivable from NL (4323.9 million, 4328.6 million and
4112.7 million at December 31, 2001, March 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002) matures in 2010 with interest
payable monthly. The note receivable from NL was established in 2001 as a result of a series of noncash
transactions between KII, NL and Kronos. The note receivable from NL was reduced in April 2002 to
$101 million and correspondingly, KII’s note payable to Kronos was also reduced to $101 million. See
Note 8. The 8.7% fixed-rate note receivable from NL matures in 2008 with interest payable quarterly.
Variable-rate notes receivable consists of eight individual notes from NL of which five mature in 2003 and
three mature in 2010, with interest rates ranging from U.S. LIBOR plus .625% to U.S. LIBOR plus 1.625%
(6.789% to 7.789% at December 31, 2000, 2.5875% to 3.5875% at December 31, 2001, and 2.5875% to
3.5875% at March 31, 2002 and April 30, 2002, respectively) payable semi-annually.

The Company has two notes receivable from Kronos. The fixed-rate note receivable of $217 million
matures in 2012, bears interest at 7.87% and arose from the sale of KC to Kronos in April 2002. See Note 1.
The variable rate note receivable ($44.9 million) matures in 2003 and bears interest at U.S. LIBOR plus
1.625% (7.789% at December 31, 2000, and 3.5875% at December 31, 2001, March 31, 2002 and April 30,
2002, respectively) payable semi-annually.

The Company periodically converts interest receivable from affiliates to notes receivable from affiliates.
For the years ended 1999, 2000, 2001, and the three and four months ended March 31, 2002 and April 30,
2002, respectively, the interest transferred to notes receivable from affiliates totaled nil, $24.8 million,
$25.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively.

**Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies:**

**_Leases_**

The Company leases, pursuant to operating leases, various manufacturing and office space and
transportation equipment. Most of the leases contain purchase and/or various term renewal options at fair
market and fair rental values, respectively. In most cases management expects that, in the normal course of
business, leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases.

The Company’s principal German operating subsidiary leases the land under its Leverkusen TiO2
production facility pursuant to a lease expiring in 2050. The Leverkusen facility, with approximately twothirds of the Company’s current TiO2 production capacity, is located within the lessor’s extensive
manufacturing complex. Under a separate supplies and services agreement expiring 2011, the lessor provides
some raw materials, auxiliary and operating materials and utilities services necessary to operate the

F-28


-----

Leverkusen facility. Currently, both the lease and the supplies and services agreements restrict the Company’s
ability to transfer ownership or use of the Leverkusen facility.

Net rent expense aggregated $7 million in 1999, and $6 million in 2000 and 2001, respectively. At
December 31, 2001, minimum rental commitments under the terms of noncancellable operating leases were as
follows:

**_Capital Expenditures_**

At December 31, 2001 the estimated cost to complete capital projects in process approximated
$4 million to complete the reconstruction of the Leverkusen Sulfate Plant.

**_Purchase Commitments_**

KUS has long-term supply contracts that provide for certain affiliates’ chloride feedstock requirements
through 2003. The Company and certain of its affiliates purchase chloride feedstock underlying these longterm supply contracts from KUS. See Note 15. The agreements require KUS to purchase certain minimum
quantities of feedstock with average minimum annual purchase commitments aggregating approximately
$159 million.

**_Environmental, Product Liability and Litigation Matters_**

The Company’s operations are governed by various foreign environmental laws and regulations. Certain
of the Company’s businesses are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture or use of substances or
compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws.
As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain past and current operations and products of
the Company have the potential to cause environmental or other damage. The Company has implemented and
continues to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks. The policy of the
Company is to maintain compliance with applicable foreign environmental laws and regulations at all of its
facilities and to strive to improve its environmental performance. It is possible that future developments, such
as stricter requirements of environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder, could adversely affect the
Company’s production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of such substances as well as
the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company’s production facilities operate in an environmental regulatory framework in which
governmental authorities typically are granted broad discretionary powers which allow them to issue operating
permits required for the plants to operate. The Company believes all of its plants are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental laws.

The Company is also involved in various other environmental, contractual, product liability and other
claims and disputes incidental to its business.

F-29


-----

The Company currently believes the disposition of all claims and disputes, individually or in the
aggregate, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity.

**_Concentrations of Credit Risk_**

Sales of TiO2 accounted for approximately 90% of net sales during 1999, 2000 and 2001. The remaining
sales result from the mining and sale of ilmenite ore (a raw material used in the sulfate pigment production
process), and the manufacture and sale of iron-based water treatment chemicals (derived from co-products of
the TiO2 production processes). TiO2 is generally sold to the paint, plastics and paper, as well as fibers,
rubber, ceramics, inks and cosmetics markets. Such markets are generally considered ‘‘quality-of-life’’
markets whose demand for TiO2 is influenced by the relative economic well-being of the various geographic
regions. TiO2 is sold to over 4,000 customers, with the top ten customers approximating 24% of net sales in
1999 and 2000, and 23% of net sales in 2001. Approximately 75% of the Company’s TiO2 sales by volume
were to Europe in 1999, 2000 and 2001. Approximately 10% of sales by volume were to North America in
1999, 2000 and 2001.

held no derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2000 and 2001, March 31, 2002, and April 30,
2002.

**Note 20 — Capital Contribution:**

On January 31, 2000, NL contributed its investment of $291.9 million in NL Capital Corporation
(‘‘NLCC’’), a wholly owned subsidiary of NL, to Kronos, which immediately contributed it to KII. NLCC
then merged with KII (with KII being the surviving corporation in the merger.) The net assets acquired in the
merger were recorded at predecessor carryover basis in accordance with GAAP due to the common control of
KII and NLCC by NL. NLCC previously conducted NL’s rheological additives business which was sold in
1998. Substantially all of the net proceeds from the sale of the operational assets related to the rheological
additives business were loaned to NL and Kronos. Subsequent to the sale, NLCC did not conduct any

operations and its major assets held were such notes receivable from affiliates. Of the $291.9 million,
$278.9 million represented noncurrent notes receivable from NL and Kronos, which were classified as a
reduction of stockholder’s equity at the time of the merger.
