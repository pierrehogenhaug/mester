429,Offerings 2017.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"We refer to EBITDA in various places in this offering memorandum. We define EBITDA as net income before income taxes, interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA is used by our management to assess the performance of our operations. We believe disclosure of EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to analyze the performance of our operations in the same way that our management assesses performance. EBITDA is a supplemental financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and has important limitations as an analytical tool. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, this measure is defined differently by different companies in our industry and, accordingly, such measure as used in this offering memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC and in public disclosures of “non-GAAP financial measures,” such as those mentioned above and ratios related thereto. These measures are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. These rules govern the manner in which non-GAAP financial measures are publicly presented and require, among other things: - a presentation with equal or greater prominence of the most comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP; and - a statement disclosing the purposes for which management uses the non-GAAP financial measure. The rules prohibit, among other things: - the exclusion of charges or liabilities that require, or will require, cash settlement or would have required cash settlement, absent an ability to settle in another manner, from a non-GAAP liquidity measure; and -vii ----- - the adjustment of a non-GAAP performance measure to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it has occurred in the past two years or is reasonably likely to recur within the next two years. Please see “Summary—Summary Financial Data and Other Information” for a further discussion and quantification of non-GAAP financial measures used in this offering memorandum, including the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and to investors and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

429,Offerings 2017.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.1,Competitive strengths,7.1.1,Well-Positioned to Capitalize on TiO2 Market Strength and Economic Growth,"We are well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing improvement in the TiO2 industry cycle as demonstrated by our recent results. Industry data suggests that global TiO2 demand will have increased by approximately 9% between 2015 and 2017 while net production capacity increased by approximately 4%, creating an environment favorable for TiO2 price increases. The TiO2 markets are in the process of returning to more normalized levels following a period of reduced demand during the 2012 – 2014 time period, as discussed above. Various TiO2 key demand drivers are projected to remain strong, supporting continued sector strengthening. The Leading Indicator of Home Remodeling Activity is forecasted to increase 6.7% in 2017 and 2.0% per year through 2025; expected global GDP growth rates for 2017 and 2018 are 3.5% and 3.6%, respectively; end-use demand for coatings and plastics remain strong with IHS Chemical projecting 4.0% and 3.4% CAGRs for 2016-2021, respectively. If prices continue to increase in and beyond 2017, and as capacity utilization increases globally, TiO2 margins are expected to increase to more historically normalized levels. We started 2017 with average selling prices 10% higher than the beginning of 2016, and average selling prices increased by an additional 12% in the first half of 2017. Despite recent pricing momentum, prices remain significantly below prior peak levels. Following industry-wide increases in production volumes in 2016, most western TiO2 producers are running near 100% of practical capacity and TiO2 inventory levels have declined significantly at both the producer and customer level. With the strong sales volumes experienced in the first half of 2017, we continue -4 ----- to see evidence of strengthening demand for TiO2 products in our primary markets. TZMI projects future TiO2 price increases, reflecting continued positive industry outlook. In addition to our efforts to maximize profitability, current market conditions have allowed us to execute new long-term supply contracts with strategic customers to mitigate future volatility in pricing levels. We have exposure to both emerging and mature markets, and believe that our geographic mix positions us to take advantage of significant growth opportunities. We have invested in commercial and sales and marketing resources in export markets by investing in distribution centers and by making a broad strategic commitment to building and firmly entrenching our presence in those areas. In order to do so, we have made efforts to improve these regional customer relationships, and have proactively shifted sales volumes to export customers in order to continue to strengthen our presence. We believe that long-term volumes in these geographies will drive value for the overall business through all cycles.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289
429,Offerings 2017.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.1,Competitive strengths,7.1.2,Leading Market Position Anchored in World Class Products and Production Technology,"We are one of the top five global producers of TiO2, the second largest TiO2 producer in Europe and the largest chloride process TiO2 producer in Europe, with production capacity of approximately 555,000 metric tons per year, accounting for approximately 9% of global TiO2 production. We have a 17% market share in Western Europe and 16% market share in North America and are the leading seller of TiO2 in several countries, including Germany, the largest consumer of TiO2 on a per capita basis. Approximately 75% of our production capacity utilizes the chloride process, which is closely guarded by the major western producers due to its technological advantages in many applications. In addition to the process know-how, the chloride process requires significant capital investments for greenfield expansions, uninterrupted power supplies and highly skilled labor forces, all of which have prevented emerging market participants from building meaningful chloride process capabilities. Additionally, the chloride process produces a high volume, high grade pigment, while providing lower total conversion costs through higher pigment yield, less waste, lower energy requirements and lower labor costs. Our typical chloride process cost structure is comprised of approximately 49% feedstock, 28% fixed cost, 9% utilities and 14% other raw materials. Since some of the traditional incentives for manufacturers to locate in China, such as relatively lower labor costs, are not as important for the chloride process, and the chloride process requires a stable, uninterrupted power supply (which may not be as prevalent in China as other parts of the world), the incentive for Chinese competitors to invest in chloride process technology is lessened. Therefore, western producers collectively produce approximately 90% of the world’s total chloride production, which we believe is superior in quality to Chinese TiO2, that is virtually all based on sulfate production processes and is typically used in different applications. Many coatings and plastics applications, which comprise over 80% of industry demand by volume, typically require the highest quality TiO2 that is only produced by the major western producers. We have world-class facilities throughout North America and Europe, including the most recent greenfield plant in the western world and the only sulfate process plant in North America. We and our predecessors have produced and marketed TiO2 in North America and Europe, our primary markets, for over 100 years. We believe the stability of our ownership structure (since 1986) provides multiple points of differentiation versus our competitors. Building on our history of innovation, we maintain a dedicated team of scientists, chemists, process engineers, and technicians. We offer a broad portfolio of products that include over 40 different grades of TiO2 for plastics and coatings by leveraging our dual chloride / sulfate process capabilities, in addition to continuously improving the quality of existing grades through our technical support -5 ----- department. Since 2012, we have added 4 new grades for pigments and other applications. We have increased production capacity by approximately 9.0% over the past ten years through innovative de-bottlenecking requiring only moderate capital expenditures, and it is reasonably likely we will set a new company record for production volumes in 2017. Unlike most competitors, all of our chloride process plants utilize the same technology, which enables improvements to be efficiently implemented in all plants at minimal cost. The aforementioned investments have enhanced Kronos’ ability to achieve economies of scale benefits.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289
429,Offerings 2017.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.1,Competitive strengths,7.1.3,Vertically Integrated Production Process; Security of Feedstock Supply,"Our raw material procurement capabilities and vertically integrated sulfate production configuration distinguish us from many of our peers. The primary raw materials used in the TiO2 sulfate production process are titanium-containing feedstock, primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag and sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid is widely available, titanium containing feedstock used in the sulfate process is distributed by a limited number of suppliers principally in Norway, Canada, Australia, India South Africa, and China. We are one of the few vertically integrated producers of sulfate-process pigments, with 100% vertical integration in our sulfate business in Europe (representing 22% of total production capacity). We own and operate two ilmenite mines in Norway which supplied all of our feedstock requirements for our European sulfate process plants and 93% of total feedstock needs for our sulfate process pigment plants globally in 2016. Based on internal estimates, we expect these reserves to last over 50 years, thereby meeting European feedstock requirements into the foreseeable future. Historically, sales to third parties have ranged from 45% to 70% of our ilmenite ore production, providing a natural hedge to fluctuations in feedstock prices. We have also established long-term relationships with third-party ore suppliers that provide a secure source of feedstock for all chloride process facilities, as well as the sulfate process line in Varennes, Quebec (which is not serviced by our Norwegian sources). We source feedstock from multiple suppliers, and over 70% of our third party chloride process feedstock requirements are purchased under long-term contracts (the remainder of our chloride process feedstock ore requirements are currently provided under contracts with a term of one year or less which are subject to renewal). We have a proven track record of securing sufficient feedstock to operate our plants due to our relationships with these suppliers and others. If approved, the proposed merger of Tronox and Cristal will result in only three material buyers of chloride process feedstock in the market (as Tronox’s internal feedstock ore sources would be expected to cover the majority of the needs of the combined entity), while the market is served by numerous suppliers. In addition, we have developed manufacturing processes that allow waste material from the sulfate TiO2 production to be converted into profitable iron-based chemical coproducts instead of being disposed, which helps us avoid additional expense.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

As a result, we have consistently generated positive cash from operations despite historical TiO2 sector volatility. Our cost structure is optimized at full production levels and as such, we target production levels at 100% of practical capacity, subject to market demand. Our goal is to achieve these targets by ensuring we have maximum product demand and reliable production assets, The flexibility associated with our chloride and sulfate process capabilities and our vast and diverse product portfolio allow us to shift into different end markets beyond coatings and plastics depending on demand trends, thereby helping us to maintain relatively high production capacity utilization rates. We intend to continue production rates in-line with recent levels. We actively manage our working capital balances by optimizing manufacturing schedules, increasing inventory turnover and reducing finished goods and raw materials inventory. Our vertical integration in Europe enables us to further harmonize the raw material and pigment production schedules. Our working capital balances typically act as a counter balance to our earnings results in order to smooth cash generation through the cycle. -7 ----- We plan to make capital expenditures required to maintain and improve the overall performance, safety and reliability of our manufacturing asset base as well as implement new accounting and manufacturing systems.

Historically, we have taken decisive action in response to industry conditions, undertaken proactive efforts to mitigate fixed cost inflation, and made disciplined investments in production capabilities to support our growth. We regularly seek opportunities for further improvements across our Company. In 2015 we initiated a restructuring plan designed to improve our long-term cost structure, which resulted in approximately $19 million of annual cost savings. These workforce reductions did not negatively impact our ability to operate our production facilities at their practical capacity rates, as evidenced by the production levels we achieved in 2016 and our anticipated record production in 2017. Through careful planning and an organizational re-design, we are in the process of implementing other cost reduction initiatives throughout the organization that are expected to generate additional savings through 2020 and beyond, with minimal to no impact on our operational and commercial capabilities. We also actively invest in process productivity improvements. We have increased our production capacity by a CAGR of 2.0% since 1995 through innovative production debottlenecking and process engineering enhancements without any brownfield or greenfield investments since 1992. Unlike most competitors, all of our chloride process plants utilize the same technology, which enables improvements to be efficiently implemented in all plants at minimal costs.

The market for TiO2 is extremely competitive, and we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, technical service, price, and the availability of high performance pigment grades. Pricing is largely a product of negotiation between suppliers and their respective customers. Cost advantages are typically driven by scale of plants, proprietary process technology, production know-how and environmental regulations and, to a lesser extent, type of feedstock, source of energy, and cost of local labor. The primary raw materials used in sulfate and chloride process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock (including ilmenite, rutile, chloride and sulfate slag and synthetic rutile). The global market for titanium-bearing ores is diverse in terms of supplier options, and the market is structured by short and long-term contracts with market-based pricing subject to ongoing negotiations throughout each year, often on a quarterly basis. In the past we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to titanium-bearing ore supply contracts prior to their expiration. We believe there is more than ample global supply of titanium containing feedstock ore, and do not currently expect any difficulties in procuring sufficient quantities of ore necessary to operate our plants for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we have structured a portion of our feedstock contracts with pricing mechanisms in an attempt to reduce earnings volatility through all cycles. These procurement dynamics allow us to be flexible in response to pricing fluctuations and quantity obligations. Our vertically integrated structure in the sulfate production business provides further protection by allowing us to capture margin despite broader variability in pricing. As a critical component of everyday applications such as coatings, plastics, paper, and other specialty products, TiO2 is considered a “quality of life” product, and demand has generally been driven by global economic activity and GDP per capita. There is currently no effective substitute for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties capable of achieving comparable opacity and brightness in a cost-effective manner. As such, customer demands for TiO2 generally increase with rising standards of living in various regions of the world. Our customers also differentiate their finished products based on product quality which drives increased demand for TiO2, because of its superior performance attributes. According to industry estimates, TiO2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% since 1990. Per capita consumption of TiO2 in Western Europe and the United States far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO2 on a per capita basis. Markets for TiO2 are generally increasing in South America, Eastern Europe, the Asia Pacific region and China and we believe these are significant markets where we expect continued growth as economies in these regions continue to develop and quality-of-life products, including TiO2, experience greater demand. Historically, the TiO2 industry has been highly sensitive to supply and demand dynamics. Changes in TiO2 consumption levels and available production capacity result in changes to TiO2 industry operating rates and have a direct impact on our profitability. During 2010 and 2011, TiO2 demand reached levels that approximated estimated industry capacity, leading to a period of supply shortage and peak profitability. Beginning in 2012, the TiO2 industry experienced decreased sales and production volumes as the majority of TiO2 producers and consumers undertook inventory de-stocking initiatives in response to global economic weakness and uncertainty. As demand weakened, TiO2 industry operating rates declined, leading to declines in selling prices. At the same time, industry contracts for the procurement of feedstock ore generally switched from contracts with long-term fixed pricing mechanisms to pricing mechanisms more generally based on spot pricing. This transition was accompanied by significant increases in the cost of feedstock ore, which also led to reduced profitability until -3 ----- feedstock ore costs began to moderate beginning in 2015. Between 2013 and 2014, the TiO2 industry was characterized by flat sales volumes driven primarily by low demand and widespread destocking efforts. Profitability across the industry continued to lag in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 as producers experienced low utilization rates despite demand recovering. Since the first quarter of 2016, however, inventory levels and consumption patterns have stabilized and the industry has begun to see improvement in pricing as a result of growing demand levels and continued capacity rationalization. This positive momentum is expected to continue, driving additional upside relative to historically normalized price and margin levels. Although overall industry demand is expected to continue to strengthen through 2017 as a result of improving worldwide economic conditions, we do not expect any other significant efforts will be undertaken by us or our principal competitors to further increase capacity via new TiO2 plants or brownfield expansions in Europe or North America in the foreseeable future. Due to the constraints of high capital costs and extended lead time associated with adding significant new TiO2 production capacity, especially for premium grades of TiO2 products produced from the chloride process, we believe increased and sustained profit margins will be necessary to financially justify major expansions of TiO2 production capacity required to meet expected future growth in demand. As a result of relative customer inventory levels during the recent past and the resulting adverse effect on global TiO2 pricing, some industry projects to increase TiO2 production capacity have been cancelled or deferred indefinitely, and announcements have been made regarding the closure of certain facilities. Given the lead time required for production capacity expansions, a shortage of TiO2 could occur if economic conditions improve and global demand levels for TiO2 increase sufficiently.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

See “Description of Notes—Redemption for Tax Reasons.” Payment of Additional Amounts . . In the event that taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from payments on the Notes or the guarantees thereof, the Issuer or the Guarantors will, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, pay such additional amounts as will result in the payment of the amounts which would have been payable in respect of such Notes had no such withholding or deduction been required after deduction or withholding of such taxes (the “Additional Amounts”). See “Description of Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts.” Change of Control Offer . . . . . . . . . . If Parent or the Issuer experiences certain change of control events, the Issuer must offer to repurchase the Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the applicable repurchase date.

These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications as described under “Description of Notes— Certain Covenants.” Many of these covenants will cease to apply to the Notes during any time that the Notes have investment grade ratings from both Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor’s so long as there is no default under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes— Certain Covenants—Covenant Suspension.” No Registration Rights . . . . . . . . . . . The offer and sale of the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and no offer to exchange the Notes in a transaction registered under the Securities Act will be made.

For the year ended December 31, 2016 and the six month period ended June 30, 2017, 93% and 94%, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to sales of TiO2. TiO2 is used in many “quality of life” products for which demand historically has been linked to global, regional and local gross domestic product and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events or economic conditions. Such events are likely to cause a decrease in demand for our products and, as a result, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Pricing within the global TiO2 industry over the long term is cyclical and changes in economic conditions, especially in Western industrialized nations, can significantly impact our earnings and operating cash flows. Historically, the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of increasing and decreasing demand. Relative changes in the selling prices for our products are one of the main factors that affect the level of our profitability. In periods of increasing demand, our selling prices and profit margins generally will tend to increase, while in periods of decreasing demand our selling prices and profit margins generally tend to decrease. In addition, pricing may affect customer inventory levels as customers may from time to time accelerate purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price increases or defer purchases of TiO2 in advance of anticipated price decreases. Our ability to further increase capacity without additional investment in greenfield or brownfield capacity increases may be limited and as a result, our profitability may become even more dependent upon the selling prices of our products.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

Competition is based on a number of factors, such as price, product quality and service. Some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products if their costs are lower than our costs. In addition, some of our competitors’ financial, technological and other resources may be greater than our resources and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Further, consolidation of our competitors or customers may result in reduced demand for our products or make it more difficult for us to compete with our competitors.

In addition, many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase.",13.3.1,,"The number of sources for and availability of certain raw materials is specific to the particular geographical region in which a facility is located. For example, titanium-containing feedstocks suitable for use in our TiO2 facilities are available from a limited number of suppliers around the world. Political and economic instability in the countries from which we purchase our raw material supplies could adversely affect their availability. If our worldwide vendors were unable to meet their contractual obligations and we were unable to obtain necessary raw materials, we could incur higher costs for raw materials or may be required to reduce production levels. We experienced significantly higher ore costs in 2012 which carried over into 2013. We have seen moderation in the purchase cost of third-party feedstock ore since 2013. We may also experience higher operating costs such as energy costs, which could affect our profitability. We may not always be able to increase our selling prices to offset the impact of any higher costs or reduced production levels, which could reduce our earnings and decrease our liquidity. We have long-term supply contracts that provide for our TiO2 feedstock requirements that currently expire through 2019. While we believe we will be able to renew these contracts, there can be no assurance we will be successful in renewing them or in obtaining long-term extensions to them prior to expiration. Our current agreements (including those entered into through February 2017) require us to purchase certain minimum quantities of feedstock with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $605 million in years subsequent to December 31, 2016. In addition, we have other long-term supply and service contracts that provide for various raw materials and services. These agreements require us to purchase certain minimum quantities or services with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $158 million at December 31, 2016.

We endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which our products are imported. However, we may be unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property in key jurisdictions. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights. Although it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, or adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know-how. We also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, know-how or trade secrets could result in a material loss of our competitive position, which could lead to significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of resources and management’s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings.

It is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these or other types of cases for which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity, or which may be beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters.

To date, the permit system in effect in the various countries in which we operate has not had a material adverse effect on our financial results. However, if further greenhouse gas legislation were to be enacted in one or more countries, it could negatively impact our future results from operations through increased costs of production, particularly as it relates to our energy requirements or our need to obtain emissions permits.

Kronos is permitted by the terms of its debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions therein. Kronos’ inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations or to refinance its debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on Kronos’ business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, covenants in Kronos’ debt agreements, including the Indenture governing the Notes, could limit its ability to engage in certain transactions and pursue its business strategies, which could adversely affect liquidity. Kronos’ indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders and creditors, including: - limiting Kronos’ ability to borrow money for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes, guarantee additional debt or issue redeemable, convertible of preferred equity; - limiting Kronos’ ability to make distributions or prepay its debt, incur liens, enter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries, sell or otherwise dispose of assets (including capital stock of subsidiaries), enter into transactions with affiliates and merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of its assets; - requiring Kronos to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to payments on indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development, and other corporate requirements; - increasing Kronos’ vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; - limiting Kronos’ ability to respond to business opportunities; -22 ----- - increasing Kronos’ vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions; - limiting Kronos’ flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and - placing Kronos at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors. Indebtedness outstanding under the North American Revolving Credit Agreement and European Credit Agreement accrues interest at variable rates. To the extent market interest rates rise, the cost of Kronos’ debt would increase, adversely affecting Kronos’ financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition to our indebtedness, at December 31, 2016, we were party to various lease and other agreements (including feedstock ore purchase contracts and other long-term supply and service contracts, as discussed above) pursuant to which, along with our indebtedness, we are committed to pay approximately $433 million in 2017. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our future ability to generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flows from operating activities sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when they become due and to fund our other liquidity needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt before maturity.

We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations.

Further, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements, including the Indenture and the North American Revolving Credit Agreement and European Credit Agreement, could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions.

Under United States federal bankruptcy -25 ----- law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the issuance of the Notes, the delivery of guarantees, and the granting of security interests related to the Notes could be avoided as fraudulent transfers or conveyances if a court determined that the Issuer, at the time it issued the Notes or granted the security interests related to the Notes or any of the Guarantors, at the time they delivered the applicable guarantee or granted the security interests related to the Notes (or, in some jurisdictions, at the time payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee thereof), - issued the Notes or provided the applicable guarantee, as the case may be, or granted the security interests related to the Notes, with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding any present or future creditor; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for issuing the Notes or providing such guarantee, as the case may be, or granting the security interests related to the Notes, and - one of the following applies: - it was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such issuance, provision, or granting, - it was engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital, or - it intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. In addition, any payment by the debtor or a Guarantor under the Notes or a guarantee of the Notes could be voided and required to be returned to the debtor or Guarantor, as the case may be, or deposited in a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the debtor or Guarantor. Among other things, under United States bankruptcy law, a payment may be avoided as a preference if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any outside party and such payment would give such insider or outsider party more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the United States Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for such guarantee and/or lien if such Guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes and/or such guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether the Issuer or a Guarantor was solvent at the relevant time which, if applicable in a particular jurisdiction, may be when payment became due under the Notes or a guarantee. Regardless of the actual standard applied by the court, we cannot be certain that the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee, or the granting of a security interest related to the Notes or a guarantee, would not be avoided as a preference, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise, or that the issuance of the Notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to -26 ----- the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s other debt. Generally, however, a debtor or a guarantor would be considered insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets, - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature, or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. To the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds unenforceable for any other reason the Notes or a guarantee, your claims against the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor would be eliminated or limited, and to the extent that a court avoids or otherwise finds unenforceable for any other reason the liens related to the Notes or a guarantee, you would lose the benefit of such security interest and your claims under the Notes and related guarantees could be effectively subordinated to our secured debt. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts already received from the Issuer or such Guarantor. Further, the avoidance of the Notes, a related guarantee, or a lien related to the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt that, in turn, could result in acceleration of such debt. In certain circumstances, a court may subordinate claims in respect of the Notes or a guarantee to all other debts of an Issuer or a Guarantor, or take other actions detrimental to the noteholders, based on equitable or other grounds. We cannot be certain as to the standards that a court might apply and whether it might find such subordination or other actions appropriate. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect the guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance law or may reduce or eliminate the Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless. Even if the guarantees of the Notes remain in force, the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantee may not be sufficient to pay the Notes in full when due and, even if the liens securing the guarantees related to the Notes remain in force, the value of the Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests, the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company or which is entered into within a certain period prior to insolvency or bankruptcy, may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of a Guarantor may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantee and that the applicable court may determine the guarantee should be limited or voided.

The Notes Collateral is comprised primarily of the equity interests in certain subsidiaries of the Issuer and the Guarantors (including the Parent) and excludes all other assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors. Accordingly, holders of the Notes will have no direct recourse to the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the Notes and the note guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any obligations secured by the assets of the Issuer and/or the Guarantors. By its nature, some or all of the Notes Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. The value of the assets pledged as Notes Collateral for the Notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, competition or other future trends. No appraisal of the value of the collateral has been made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this offering memorandum and the value of the Notes Collateral at any time is subject to fluctuations that will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers for the collateral. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Notes Collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, after first satisfying our obligations in full under claims that are effectively senior to the Notes, if any. There also can be no assurance that the Notes Collateral will be saleable and, even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Notes Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by the holders of the Notes from the sale of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes and the obligations under the Notes will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other senior unsecured indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. In addition, in any United States bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, it is possible that we, as debtor in possession, any trustee in bankruptcy, or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the Notes Collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing is less than the then-current principal amount of the Notes. Upon a finding by a United States bankruptcy court that the Notes were undercollateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes could be bifurcated between a secured claim in an amount equal to the value of the Notes Collateral and an unsecured claim with respect to the remainder of its claim, which would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Notes Collateral. The consequences of a finding of undercollateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the Notes to receive post-petition interest and costs, including attorneys’ fees or other fees and expenses, and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the Notes to receive “adequate protection” under United States bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at any time prior to such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments would be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the Notes. Thus, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Notes Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other senior secured obligations, interest may cease to accrue on the Notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Notes Collateral will be sufficient to pay the obligations due under the Notes. -31 ----- The collateral agent’s ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as making additional filings.

These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Notes Collateral in any foreclosure and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Notes Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the Notes Collateral may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited.

429,Offerings 2017.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.33,Rights of holders of the Notes may be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.,13.33.1,,"If a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us, the ability of holders of the Notes to collect on the Notes may be significantly impaired. A bankruptcy case may be commenced by us or by certain unsecured or undersecured creditors as provided in the United States Bankruptcy Code. The right of the collateral agent for the Notes to repossess and dispose of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to, or possibly even after, the collateral agent for the Notes has repossessed and disposed of the Notes Collateral. Under the United States Bankruptcy Code, the “automatic stay” prohibits a secured creditor, such as the collateral agent for the Notes, from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, applicable bankruptcy law and/or the bankruptcy court generally permit the debtor to continue to retain and to use of the Notes Collateral, and the proceeds, products, rents, or profits of the Notes Collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances, but it is generally intended to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral from diminution as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. “Adequate protection” may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, of such type, at such time, and in such amount as the bankruptcy court may determine. The bankruptcy court has broad discretionary powers in all these matters, including the valuation of the Notes Collateral and the nature, accessibility or value of any other Notes Collateral that may be substituted for it. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case or -34 ----- the length of the delay in making any such payments, whether or when the collateral agent for the Notes could or would repossess or dispose of the Notes Collateral, the value of the Notes Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Notes Collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Notes Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the holders of the Notes would be “undersecured.” Federal United States bankruptcy laws do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, costs and attorneys’ fees on the “undersecured” portion of a creditor’s claims during a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of its claims. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, the following factors, among others, might bear on recoveries by holders of the Notes: - a debtor in a bankruptcy case does not have the ability to compel performance of a “financial accommodation,” including the funding of any undrawn loans that might be contemplated to fund operations; - the bankruptcy court may approve debtor-in-possession financing that may be required to be repaid before secured and other creditors are paid; - other secured creditors may seek, and perhaps receive, relief from the automatic stay to foreclose their respective liens; and - the cost, delay, and procedures of bankruptcy, including potentially pursuing a reorganization plan, could affect operations, revenues, and the value available for creditors. Moreover, in a bankruptcy proceeding, the bankruptcy court would have broad discretion to approve (or disapprove) transactions and otherwise take actions that could disadvantage the holders of the Notes. Among other things, any disposition of the Notes Collateral during a bankruptcy case would require permission from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances). Accordingly, there can be no assurances, pending or following the completion of such a proceeding, with respect to the following, among other things: whether and when any payments under the Notes would be made; whether the terms and conditions of the Notes or any rights of the holders of the Notes would be altered or ignored without the consent of holders of Notes; whether holders of the Notes would be able to enforce their rights against the Guarantors under their guarantees; and whether and to what extent holders of Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or receive any payment at all (or in what form). Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a bankruptcy court could order substantive consolidation of either of the Issuer or a Guarantor with one or more of their affiliates or subsidiaries. We believe that the Issuer and the Guarantors have observed and will observe certain formalities and operating procedures that are generally recognized requirements for maintaining their respective separate existences, and that their respective assets and liabilities can be readily identified as distinct from each other’s and from those of their affiliates and subsidiaries.

TiO2 is used for a variety of manufacturing applications, including plastics, paints, paper and other industrial products. During 2016 and the first six months of 2017, approximately one-half of our sales volumes were sold into European markets. We believe we are the largest producer of TiO2 in Europe with an estimated 17% share of European TiO2 sales volumes in 2016. In addition, we estimate we had a 16% share of North American TiO2 sales volumes in 2016. Our production facilities are located throughout Europe and North America. We consider TiO2 to be a “quality of life” product, with demand affected by gross domestic product, or GDP, and overall economic conditions in our markets located in various regions of the world. Over the long-term, we expect demand for TiO2 will grow by 2% to 3% per year, consistent with our expectations for the long-term growth in GDP. However, even if we and our competitors maintain consistent shares of the worldwide market, demand for TiO2 in any interim or annual period may not change in the same proportion as the change in GDP, in part due to relative changes in the TiO2 inventory levels of our customers. We believe that our customers’ inventory levels are influenced in part by their expectation for future changes in market TiO2 selling prices as well as their expectation for future availability of product. Although certain of our TiO2 grades are considered specialty pigments, the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigment products with price and availability being the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service. The factors having the most impact on our reported operating results are: - TiO2 selling prices, - Our TiO2 sales and production volumes, - Manufacturing costs, particularly raw materials such as third-party feedstock ore, maintenance and energy-related expenses, and - Currency exchange rates (particularly the exchange rate for the United States dollar relative to the euro, the Norwegian krone and the Canadian dollar). Our key performance indicators are our TiO2 average selling prices, our level of TiO2 sales and production volumes and the cost of our third-party feedstock ore. TiO2 selling prices generally follow industry trends and the selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures. In addition, our effective income tax rate in both 2015 and 2016 was impacted by certain favorable and unfavorable developments discussed below. -42 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

We reported higher net income in 2017 in part due to higher income from operations in 2017 resulting from the favorable effects of higher average selling prices, higher sales and production volumes and lower raw materials and other production costs. In addition, our results in the first six months of 2017 include the recognition of a non-cash deferred income tax benefit as a result of a net decrease in our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations ($162.6 million in the year-to-date period). Our results in the first six months of 2016 include: - a pre-tax insurance settlement gain of $3.4 million ($2.6 million net of income tax expense), and - a non-cash deferred income tax expense as a result of a net increase in our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations aggregating $2.9 million. We reported net income of $43.3 million for 2016 as compared to a net loss of $173.6 million for 2015. We reported net income in 2016 as compared to a net loss in 2015 due to higher income from operations in 2016, as well as an aggregate $159.0 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations recognized in 2015, and an aggregate $12.0 million pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) charge on our investment in a marketable equity security recognized in 2015. Our income from operations improved in 2016 primarily due to the net impact of higher sales and production volumes and lower average selling prices in 2016, a $21.7 million charge associated with the implementation of certain workforce reductions in 2015, lower raw materials and other production costs in 2016 (including cost savings resulting from workforce reductions implemented in 2015), the recognition of an insurance settlement gain totaling $4.3 million in 2016 from two separate business interruption claims and the net effect of changes in currency exchange rates. Of the $21.7 million charge related to the workforce reductions, $10.8 million was classified as part of cost of sales and $10.9 million was classified in selling, general and administrative expense. We reported a net loss of $173.6 million for 2015 as compared to net income of $99.2 million for 2014. We reported a net loss in 2015 primarily due to lower income from operations, the recognition of an aggregate $159.0 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations, the recognition of an aggregate $12.0 million pre-tax OTTI charge on our investment in a marketable equity security, and a $21.7 million charge associated with the implementation of certain workforce reductions. Comparability of our results was also impacted by lower average selling prices in 2015, partially offset by the favorable effects of higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing and other production costs (primarily raw materials) and the net effect of changes in currency exchange rates. Our net income in 2016 includes: - a pre-tax insurance settlement gain of $4.3 million ($3.2 million net of income tax expense) recognized in the first, second and fourth quarters, - the recognition of a net $3.4 million current income tax benefit related to the execution and finalization of an Advance Pricing Agreement between the United States and Canada, -43 ----- - the recognition of an aggregate $2.2 million non-cash tax benefit as the result of a net decrease in our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations, recognized in the second, third and fourth quarters, and - the recognition of a $2.4 million non-cash income tax expense related to an increase in our reserve for uncertain tax positions, mostly recognized in the fourth quarter. Our net loss in 2015 includes: - the recognition of an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations of $159.0 million, mostly recognized in the second quarter, - the third quarter recognition of an aggregate pre-tax OTTI loss on our investment in a marketable equity security of $12.0 million ($7.8 million net of income tax benefit), and - a pre-tax charge of $21.7 million ($18.5 million net of income tax benefit) related to workforce reduction costs, mostly recognized in the second quarter.

429,Offerings 2017.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,17.3.1,,"The accompanying “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto, the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation, income tax and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ significantly from previously-estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions. The following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements: - _Long-lived assets—We recognize an impairment charge associated with our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, whenever we determine that recovery of such long-lived asset is not probable. Such determination is made in accordance with the applicable GAAP requirements of Accounting Standard Codification, or ASC, Topic 36010-35 Property, Plant and Equipment and is based upon, among other things, estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset. Significant judgment is required in estimating such cash flows. Adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived asset, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in -44 ----- the future. We do not assess our property and equipment for impairment unless certain impairment indicators specified in ASC Topic 360-10-35 are present. We did not evaluate any long-lived assets for impairment during 2016 because no such impairment indicators were present. - _Benefit plans—We maintain various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions, or OPEB, plans. The amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and OPEB expenses and the reported amounts of pension asset and accrued pension and OPEB costs are actuarially determined based on several assumptions, including discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expected health care trend rates and expected mortality. Variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases, as applicable, in the recognized pension and OPEB obligations, pension and OPEB expenses and funding requirements. These assumptions are more fully described below under “Defined Benefit Pension Plans” and “OPEB Plans.” - _Income taxes—We recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities for each tax-paying jurisdiction in which we operate are netted and presented as either a noncurrent deferred income tax asset or liability, as applicable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, it is possible that we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would morelikely-than-not be realized in the future, resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made. For example, at December 31, 2016, we have substantial net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in Germany (the equivalent of $638 million for German corporate purposes and $71 million for German trade tax purposes) and in Belgium (the equivalent of $93 million for Belgian corporate tax purposes), all of which have an indefinite carryforward period. As a result, we have net deferred income tax assets with respect to these two jurisdictions, primarily related to these NOL carryforwards. The German corporate tax is similar to the United States federal income tax, and the German trade tax is similar to the United States state income tax. As more fully described below under “Results of Operations—Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015—Income Tax Expense,” at December 31, 2016, we had a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance recognized with respect to such net deferred income tax assets of our Belgian and German operations. As more fully described below under “Results of Operations—Comparison of Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 to Six Months Ended June 30, 2016—Income tax expense (benefit),” at June 30, 2017, we concluded that such deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was no longer required to be recognized with respect to such net deferred income tax assets of our Belgian and German operations. We record a reserve for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is more-likely-thannot our tax positions will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. It is possible that in the future we may change our assessment regarding the probability that our tax positions will prevail that would require an adjustment to the amount of our reserve for uncertain tax positions that could either increase or decrease, as applicable, reported net income in the period the change in assessment was made. -45 ----- In addition, we evaluate at the end of each reporting period whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our non-United States subsidiaries are permanently reinvested (as that term is defined in GAAP). While we may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested, facts and circumstances can change in the future and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances, such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our non-United States subsidiaries or a change in tax law, could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested. In such an event, we would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental United States income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously-considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were to be distributed to the United States. - _Contingencies—We record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies and commitments become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. However, new information may become available or circumstances (such as applicable laws and regulations) may change, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters (and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change). Results from operations is impacted by certain of these and other significant judgments and estimates, such as allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories, impairment of equity method investments and long-lived assets, defined benefit pension plans and loss accruals. In addition, net income is impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

TiO2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures, changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs. Our sales volumes increased 5% in the first six months of 2017 as compared to the first six months of 2016 primarily due to higher sales in the North American and export markets, partially offset by lower sales in the Latin American market. Our sales volumes in the first half of 2017 set a new overall record for a first-six-month period. In addition to the impact of changes in average TiO2 selling prices and sales volumes, we estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately $15 million as compared to the first six months of 2016. _Cost of sales—Cost of sales decreased $0.6 million in the first six months of 2017 compared_ to the same period in 2016 primarily due to the net impact of a 5% increase in sales volumes, efficiencies related to a 9% increase in TiO2 production volumes, lower raw materials and other production costs of approximately $14 million and currency fluctuations (primarily the euro). Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 71% in the first six months of 2017 compared to 86% in the same period of 2016 due to the favorable impact of higher average selling prices, lower raw materials and other production costs and efficiencies related to higher production volumes. -47 ----- _Other operating income and expense, net—Other operating income and expense in the first_ six months of 2016 includes an insurance settlement gain of $3.4 million related to a 2014 business interruption claim. _Gross margin and income from operations—Income from operations increased by $112.2_ million in the first six months of 2017 compared to the first six months of 2016. Income from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to 15% in the first six months of 2017 from 2% in the same period of 2016. This increase was driven by the increase in gross margin, which increased to 29% for the first six months of 2017 compared to 14% for the first six months of 2016. As discussed and quantified above, our gross margin increased primarily due to the effects of higher average selling prices, higher sales and production volumes and lower raw materials and other production costs. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased income from operations by approximately $13 million in the first six months of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. _Other non-operating income (expense)—Interest expense decreased $0.7 million, or 7%, in_ the first six months of 2017 compared to 2016. We currently expect our interest expense for all of 2017 will be comparable to 2016. _Income tax expense (benefit)—We recognized income tax benefit of $120.1 million in the_ first six months of 2017 compared to an income tax expense of $2.5 million in the first six months of 2016. The difference is primarily due to the effect of the reversal of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance associated with our German and Belgian operations in 2017, as discussed below. Our earnings are subject to income tax in various United States and non-United States jurisdictions, and the income tax rates applicable to our pre-tax earnings (losses) of our non-United States operations are generally lower than the income tax rates applicable to our United States operations. Excluding the effect of any increase or decrease in our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, we would generally expect our overall effective tax rate to be lower than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily because of our non-United States operations. Our effective income tax rate in the first six months of 2017, excluding the impact of the reversal of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances we recognized, was higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 35%, primarily due to the income tax effect associated with the expected repatriation in 2017 of certain of our current-year earnings generated by our European subsidiaries. Our effective income tax rate in the first six months of 2016, excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances we recognized, was also higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 35%. Although we reported positive pre-tax earnings in the first six months of 2016, we recognized a net income tax benefit in the first six months of 2016, excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation we recognized, primarily because we are required under ASC 740-270 to compute the interim tax provision by calculating an estimated annual effective tax rate. Because the estimate is based on full year income, the tax rate differences may not have a meaningful relationship to quarterly or year-to-date interim pre-tax income and may produce unusual and unexpected relationships to other tax rate reconciling items. Excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance we recognized, our effective income tax rate and the net income tax benefit recognized in the first six months of 2016 was not indicative of the effective income tax rate or income tax expense (benefit) we expected for the full year of 2016, in part given the near break-even pre-tax results we recognized in the first six months of 2016. See Note 11 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax provision to our actual tax provision. We have substantial net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in Germany (the equivalent of $638 million for German corporate purposes and $71 million for German trade tax purposes at -48 ----- December 31, 2016) and in Belgium (the equivalent of $93 million for Belgian corporate tax purposes at December 31, 2016), all of which have an indefinite carryforward period. As a result, we have net deferred income tax assets with respect to these two jurisdictions, primarily related to these NOL carryforwards. The German corporate tax is similar to the United States federal income tax, and the German trade tax is similar to the United States state income tax. Prior to June 30, 2015, and using all available evidence, we had concluded no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was required to be recognized with respect to these net deferred income tax assets under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria, primarily because (i) the carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, (ii) we utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three-year period, and (iii) we expected to utilize the remainder of the carryforwards over the long term. We had also previously indicated that facts and circumstances could change, which might in the future result in the recognition of a valuation allowance against some or all of such deferred income tax assets. However, as of June 30, 2015, and given our operating results during the second quarter of 2015 and our expectations at that time for our operating results for the remainder of 2015, which had been driven in large part by the trend in our average TiO2 selling prices over such periods as well as the $21.1 million pre-tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the implementation of certain workforce reductions, we did not have sufficient positive evidence to overcome the significant negative evidence of having cumulative losses in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters in both our German and Belgian jurisdictions at June 30, 2015 (even considering that the carryforward period of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards is indefinite, one piece of positive evidence). Accordingly, at June 30, 2015, we concluded that we were required to recognize a non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria with respect to our German and Belgian net deferred income tax assets at such date. We recognized an additional non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance during the second half of 2015 due to losses recognized by our German and Belgian operations during such period. During 2016, we recognized an aggregate $2.2 million non-cash tax benefit as the result of a net decrease in such deferred income tax valuation allowance, as the impact of utilizing a portion of our German NOLs during such period more than offset the impact of additional losses recognized by our Belgian operations during such period. Such valuation allowance aggregated approximately $173 million at December 31, 2016 ($153 million with respect to Germany and $20 million with respect to Belgium). During the first six months of 2017, we recognized an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $12.7 million as a result of a net decrease in such deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, due to utilizing a portion of both the German and Belgian NOLs during such period. We continue to believe we will ultimately realize the full benefit of these German and Belgian NOL carryforwards, in part because of their indefinite carryforward period. As previously disclosed, our ability to reverse all or a portion of either the German or Belgian valuation allowance is dependent on the presence of sufficient positive evidence, such as the existence of cumulative profits in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters or profitability in recent quarters during which such profitability was trending upward throughout such period, and the ability to demonstrate future profitability for a sustainable period. As noted below, we determined such conditions were satisfied at June 30, 2017. Although our Belgian operations were profitable in the first quarter of 2017 and we utilized a portion of the Belgian NOLs during such period, our Belgian operations continued to have cumulative losses in the most recent twelve quarters at March 31, 2017. Although the results of our German operations had improved during 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, indicating a change in the negative trend in earnings that existed at December 31, 2015, and we utilized a portion of our German NOLs during 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, and we had cumulative income with respect to our German operations for the most recent twelve consecutive quarters at March 31, 2017, the sustainability of such positive trend in earnings had not yet been -49 ----- demonstrated at such date. As previously disclosed, while neither our business as a whole nor any of our principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent, TiO2 sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting seasons. While we have some insight into the overall demand expected to be generated by a particular year’s paint season and TiO2 pricing at the end of the first quarter (the start of the paint season), we have much greater insight and certainty regarding overall demand and TiO2 pricing for a particular year’s paint season by the end of the second quarter of the year, in part because some factors, such as weather, can have an impact on both overall demand and pricing each year. Accordingly, at March 31, 2017 we did not have sufficient positive evidence to support a sustainable profit trend and consequently, we did not have sufficient positive evidence under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria to support reversal of the entire valuation allowance related to our German or Belgian operations at such date. During the second quarter of 2017, our German and Belgian operations continued to be profitable, and both reported levels of profitability higher as compared to the first quarter of 2017. As discussed above, our consolidated results of operations in general, and our German and Belgian operations in particular, were favorably impacted during the quarter by, among other things, continued higher average TiO2 selling prices and higher sales volumes. Our German operations had cumulative income for the most recent twelve consecutive quarters at June 30, 2017. While our Belgian operations had cumulative losses in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters at June 30, 2017, such operations generated income in both the first and second quarters of 2017, with higher income in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter, the amount of cumulative losses of our Belgian operations for the most recent twelve consecutive quarters was lower as of June 30, 2017 as compared to both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and we expect to have cumulative profits in the third and fourth quarters. Our production facilities have been operating at near practical capacity utilization rates in the first six months of 2017. In addition, consistent with our expectation regarding our consolidated results of operations for the remainder of 2017 (as discussed below under the “Outlook” subsection), we currently believe it is likely our German and Belgian operations will continue to report improved operating results in 2017 as compared to 2016. Accordingly, at June 30, 2017 we concluded we now have sufficient positive evidence under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria to support reversal of the entire valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations. As discussed below, a large portion of the remaining valuation allowance is reversed as of June 30, 2017, but a portion of the remaining valuation allowance will be reversed during the second half of 2017. Such sufficient positive evidence includes, among other things, the existence of cumulative profits in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters (Germany) or profitability in recent quarters during which such profitability was trending upward throughout such period (Belgium), the ability to demonstrate future profitability in Germany and Belgium for a sustainable period (as supported by, among other things, recent trends in profitability, driven in large part by increases in TiO2 selling prices, and continued strong demand indicating that such profitability trends will continue in the future), and the indefinite carryforward period for the German and Belgian NOLs. Accordingly, our income tax benefit in the first six months of 2017 includes an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $149.9 million related to such reversal at June 30, 2017 ($141.9 million related to Germany, and $8.0 million related to Belgium). Such income tax benefit associated with reversal of the German and Belgian valuation allowance excludes the non-cash income tax benefit of $12.7 million, also recognized in the first six months of 2017, as discussed above. In addition to the above amounts, our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance increased by $9.5 million during the first six months of 2017 as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, which was recognized as part of other comprehensive income (loss). -50 ----- In accordance with the ASC 740-270 guidance regarding accounting for income taxes at interim dates, the amount of the valuation allowance reversed at June 30, 2017 ($149.9 million) relates to our change in judgment regarding the realizability of the related deferred income tax asset as it relates to future years (i.e. 2018 and after). A change in judgment regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets as it relates to the current year is considered in determining the estimated annual effective tax rate for the year. Accordingly, of the aggregate $173 million deferred income tax asset valuation allowance recognized at December 31, 2016, approximately $163 million has been reversed through June 30, 2017, and the remaining $20 million (which relates to the expected level of profitability of our German and Belgian operations in calendar 2017) will be reversed during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 (such aggregate reversal amount includes the $9.5 million increase to our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance as a result of changes in currency exchange rates recognized as part of other comprehensive income (loss)).

Our average selling prices at the beginning of 2016 were 17% lower as compared to the beginning of 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, our average selling prices began to rise due to the successful implementation of previously-announced price increases and average selling prices continued to rise through the remainder of 2016. Our average selling prices at the end of 2016 were 10% higher than at the end of 2015, with higher prices in all major markets, most notably in export markets. We experienced higher sales volumes in North American, European and export markets in 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Latin American market in 2016 as compared to 2015. -52 ----- The following table shows our capacity utilization rates during 2015 and 2016. **2015** **2016** First Quarter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 93% 97% Second Quarter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100% 95% Third Quarter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 95% 100% Fourth Quarter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 92% 100% Overall . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 95% 98% Our production rates in the first and fourth quarters of 2015 were impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at certain facilities, as well as necessary improvements to ensure continued compliance with our permit regulations, which resulted in longer-than-normal maintenance shutdowns in some instances. We continued to experience moderation in the cost of TiO2 feedstock ore procured from third parties in 2015 and 2016. Our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold declined throughout 2015 and 2016 due to the moderation in the cost of TiO2 feedstock and the cost savings achieved from the 2015 implementation of a restructuring plan discussed below. Consequently, our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2016 was slightly lower than our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold in 2015 (excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates). In the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a restructuring plan designed to improve our long-term cost structure. A portion of such expected cost savings are planned to occur through workforce reductions. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015, we implemented certain voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions at certain of our facilities impacting approximately 160 individuals. We recognized an aggregate $21.7 million charge in 2015 (substantially all of which was recognized in the second quarter) for such workforce reductions we had implemented through December 31, 2015, $10.8 million of which is classified as part of cost of sales and $10.9 million of which is classified in selling, general and administrative expense. The charge associated with the workforce reductions implemented in the third and fourth quarters of 2015, which impacted approximately 50 individuals, was not material due to the applicable law affecting such individuals, which generally provides for a short notice period (if any) and the payment of a nominal amount of severance (if any). See Note 13 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. _Net sales—Our net sales increased 1% or $15.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily_ due to the net effect of a 7% increase in sales volumes (which increased net sales by approximately $94 million) and a 3% decrease in average TiO2 selling prices (which decreased net sales by approximately $40 million). TiO2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally as a result of competitive market pressures, changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs. Our sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales in North American, European and export markets partially offset by lower sales in the Latin American market. Our sales volumes in 2016 set a new overall record for a full-year period. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately $9 million, or 1%, as compared to 2015. _Cost of sales—Cost of sales decreased $49.2 million or 4% in 2016 compared to 2015 due to_ the net impact of lower raw materials and other production costs of approximately $76 million (primarily caused by the lower third-party feedstock ore costs, as discussed above), approximately $4.6 million in savings resulting from workforce reductions implemented in 2015, -53 ----- a 3% increase in TiO2 production volumes and currency fluctuations (primarily the euro). In addition, cost of sales in 2015 includes approximately $10.8 million of severance costs related to the workforce reduction plan discussed above. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 81% in 2016 compared to 86% in 2015, as the favorable effects of lower raw materials and other production costs, efficiencies related to higher production volumes, and the impact of the $10.8 million workforce reduction charge classified in cost of sales in 2015 and associated cost savings from such workforce reduction realized in 2016 more than offset the unfavorable impact of lower average selling prices, as discussed above. _Other operating income and expense, net—Other operating income and expense, net in_ 2016 was $175.9 million, a decrease of $17.5 million compared to 2015. Other operating income and expense, net in 2015 included $10.9 million of severance costs related to workforce reductions classified in selling, general and administrative expense. Other operating income and expense, net in 2016 includes the favorable impact of approximately $5.6 million in cost savings realized from the workforce reductions implemented in 2015 along with income aggregating $4.3 million related to insurance settlement gains from two separate business interruption claims. _Gross margin and income (loss) from operations—Income from operations increased by_ $82.2 million, from a loss from operations of $1.1 million in 2015 to income from operations of $81.1 million in 2016. Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales increased to 6% in 2016 from less than 1% in 2015. This increase was driven by the increase in gross margin, which increased to 19% in 2016 compared to 14% in 2015, as well as the impact of the $10.9 million 2015 workforce reduction charge classified in selling, general and administrative expense and the associated cost savings from such workforce reductions realized in 2016 of $5.6 million, and the income aggregating $4.3 million related to insurance settlement gains from two separate business interruption claims. As discussed and quantified above, our gross margin increased primarily due to the net effect of lower selling prices, lower raw material and other production costs (including 2015 workforce reduction charges of $10.8 million classified as cost of sales and the associated $4.6 million of cost savings from such workforce reduction realized in 2016), higher sales volumes and higher production volumes. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates increased income from operations by approximately $14 million in 2016 as compared to 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 13% of net sales in 2016 and 2015. _Other non-operating income (expense)—We recognized a $12.0 million pre-tax impairment_ charge in the third quarter of 2015 due to other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in a marketable equity security available for sale. See Note 6 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense increased $2.0 million from $18.5 million in 2015 to $20.5 million in 2016 primarily due to the interest rate swap contract which was effective September 30, 2015 and higher average debt levels in 2016. See Note 8 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. _Income tax expense—We recognized income tax expense of $17.9 million in 2016 compared_ to income tax expense of $142.8 million in 2015. As discussed above, our income tax expense in 2015 includes an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax expense of $159.0 million related to the recognition of a deferred income tax asset valuation for our German and Belgian operations -54 ----- (mostly recognized in the second quarter), while our income tax expense in 2016 includes an aggregate $2.2 million non-cash tax benefit as the result of a net decrease in such deferred income tax valuation allowance. Our earnings are subject to income tax in various United States and non-United States jurisdictions, and the income tax rates applicable to our pre-tax earnings (losses) of our non-United States operations is generally lower than the income tax rates applicable to our United States operations. Our income tax expense in 2016 includes a $3.4 million current income tax benefit related to the execution and finalization of an Advance Pricing Agreement between the United States and Canada. Excluding the effect of any increase or decrease in our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, we would generally expect our overall effective tax rate to be lower than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily because of our non-United States operations. Our effective income tax rate in 2015, excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances we recognized, was higher than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to a current United States income tax benefit attributable to current year losses of one of our non-United States subsidiaries. Our effective income tax rate in 2016, excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances we recognized and the change to prior year tax as discussed above, was higher than the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a fourth quarter increase in our reserve for uncertain tax positions.

(18)% - Thousands of metric tons _Net sales—Our net sales decreased 18% or $303.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014,_ primarily due to the net effect of a 14% decrease in average TiO2 selling prices (which decreased net sales by approximately $231 million) and a 6% increase in sales volumes (which increased net sales by approximately $99 million). TiO2 selling prices will increase or decrease generally -55 ----- as a result of competitive market pressures, changes in the relative level of supply and demand as well as changes in raw material and other manufacturing costs. Our sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales in certain European and export markets, partially offset by lower sales in North American markets. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates decreased our net sales by approximately $138 million, or 8%, as compared to 2014. _Cost of sales—Cost of sales decreased $145.7 million or 11% in 2015 compared to 2014 due_ to the net impact of lower raw materials and other production costs of approximately $26 million (primarily caused by the lower third-party feedstock ore costs, as discussed above), a 3% increase in TiO2 production volumes and currency fluctuations (primarily the euro). In addition, cost of sales in 2015 includes approximately $10.8 million of severance costs related to the workforce reduction plan discussed above. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 86% in 2015 compared to 79% in 2014, as the unfavorable impact of lower average selling prices and the workforce reduction charge more than offset the favorable effects of lower raw material costs and efficiencies related to higher production volumes, as discussed above. _Gross margin and income (loss) from operations—Income from operations decreased by_ $150.8 million, from income of $149.7 million in 2014 to a loss from operations of $1.1 million in 2015. Income (loss) from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to less than 1% in 2015 from 9% in 2014. This decrease was driven by the decline in gross margin, which decreased to 14% in 2015 compared to 21% in 2014, as well as the negative impact of the workforce reduction charge classified as part of other operating expense ($10.9 million). As discussed and quantified above, our gross margin decreased primarily due to the net effect of lower selling prices, workforce reduction costs classified as part of cost of sales ($10.8 million), lower manufacturing costs (primarily raw materials), higher production volumes, and higher sales volumes. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates increased income from operations by approximately $40 million in 2015 as compared to 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately 13% and 12% of net sales for 2015 and 2014, respectively. As discussed above, the relative increase in 2015 is primarily due to the workforce reduction charge classified as part of selling, general and administrative expense ($10.9 million). _Other non-operating income (expense)—We recognized a $12.0 million pre-tax impairment_ charge in the third quarter of 2015 due to other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in a marketable equity security available for sale. See Note 6 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest expense increased $1.5 million from $17.0 million in 2014 to $18.5 million in 2015 primarily due to higher average debt levels mostly offset by lower average interest rates in 2015. See Note 8 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. _Income tax expense—We recognized income tax expense of $142.8 million in 2015_ compared to income tax expense of $34.5 million in 2014. As discussed above, our income tax expense in 2015 includes an aggregate non-cash deferred income tax expense of $159.0 million related to the recognition of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance for our German and Belgian operations (mostly recognized in the second quarter). -56 ----- In 2014, our income tax expense was favorably impacted by an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $5.1 million related to a net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions. Our earnings are subject to income tax in various United States and non-United States jurisdictions, and the income tax rates applicable to our pre-tax earnings (losses) of our non-United States operations are generally lower than the income tax rates applicable to our United States operations. Excluding the impact of the net reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions in 2014, our effective tax rate in such period was lower than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35% primarily due to our non-United States earnings. Our effective income tax rate in 2015, excluding the impact of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, was higher than the United States federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to a current United States income tax benefit attributable to current year losses of one of our non-United States subsidiaries.

429,Offerings 2017.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.8,Outlook,17.8.1,,"During the first half of 2017 we operated our production facilities at 100% of practical capacity. We expect our production volumes to be slightly higher in 2017 as compared to 2016, as our production rates in 2017 will be positively impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at certain facilities. Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate, we expect our 2017 sales volumes to be comparable to 2016 sales volumes. We will continue to monitor current and anticipated near-term customer demand levels and align our production and inventories accordingly. We experienced moderation in the cost of TiO2 feedstock ore procured from third parties in 2016. However, the cost of third-party feedstock ore we procured in the first half of 2017 was comparable to slightly higher as compared to the first half of 2016, and such higher cost feedstock ore is expected to be reflected in our results of operations beginning in the third quarter of 2017. We expect our cost of sales per metric ton of TiO2 sold for the full year of 2017 will be slightly higher than our per-metric ton cost in 2016. We started 2017 with average selling prices 11% higher than the beginning of 2016, and average selling prices increased by an additional 12% in the first six months of 2017. Industry data indicates that overall TiO2 inventory held by producers declined significantly during 2016. In addition, we believe most customers hold very low inventories of TiO2 with many operating on a just-in-time basis. With the strong sales volumes experienced in the first half of 2017, we continue to see evidence of strengthening demand for our TiO2 products in certain of our primary markets. We and our major competitors have announced price increases, which we began implementing in the second quarter of 2016, as contracts have allowed. The extent to which we will be able to achieve any additional price increases in the near term will depend on market conditions. Overall, we expect income from operations in 2017 will be higher as compared to 2016, principally as a result of expected higher average selling prices in 2017 as compared to 2016 and to a lesser extent from the favorable effects of anticipated higher production volumes in 2017. In addition, and as discussed above, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $162.6 million in the first six months of 2017 (including $157.6 million in the second quarter of 2017) related to our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance associated with our German and Belgian operations, and we expect the remaining valuation allowance of $20 million will be reversed during the third and fourth quarters of 2017. Due to the constraints of high capital costs and extended lead time associated with adding significant new TiO2 production capacity, especially for premium grades of TiO2 products -51 ----- produced from the chloride process, we believe increased and sustained profit margins will be necessary to financially justify major expansions of TiO2 production capacity required to meet expected future growth in demand. As a result of relative customer inventory levels during the recent past and the resulting adverse effect on global TiO2 pricing, some industry projects to increase TiO2 production capacity have been cancelled or deferred indefinitely, and announcements have been made regarding the closure of certain facilities. Given the lead time required for production capacity expansions, a shortage of TiO2 could occur if economic conditions improve and global demand levels for TiO2 increase sufficiently. Our expectations for our future operating results are based upon a number of factors beyond our control, including worldwide growth of gross domestic product, competition in the marketplace, continued operation of competitors, unexpected or earlier-than-expected capacity additions or reductions and technological advances. If actual developments differ from our expectations, our results of operations could be unfavorably affected. _Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015_",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

The majority of our sales from non-United States operations are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, principally the euro, other major European currencies and the Canadian dollar. A portion of our sales generated from our non-United States operations is denominated in the United States dollar (and consequently our nonUnited States operations will generally hold United States dollars from time to time). Certain raw materials used worldwide, primarily titanium-containing feedstocks, are purchased primarily in United States dollars, while labor and other production costs are purchased primarily in local currencies. Consequently, the translated United States dollar value of our non-United States sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or unfavorably impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period-to-period operating results. In addition to the impact of the translation of sales and expenses over time, our non-United States operations also generate currency transaction gains and losses which primarily relate to (i) the difference between the currency exchange rates in effect when non-local currency sales or operating costs (primarily United States dollar denominated) are initially accrued and when such amounts are settled with the non-local currency, (ii) changes in currency exchange rates during time periods when our non-United States operations are holding non-local currency (primarily United States dollars), and (iii) relative changes in the aggregate fair value of currency forward contracts held from time to time. As discussed in Note 18 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 14 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a portion of our currency exchange risk, and relative changes in the aggregate fair value of any currency forward contracts we hold from time to time serves in part to mitigate the currency transaction gains or losses we would otherwise recognize from the first two items described above.

Our North American Revolving Credit Facility and European Credit Facility and our Term Loan Facility contain a number of covenants and restrictions which, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, pay dividends or merge or consolidate with, or sell or transfer substantially all of our assets to, another entity, and contains other provisions and restrictive covenants customary in lending transactions of this type. Certain of our credit agreements contain provisions which could result in the acceleration of indebtedness prior to their stated maturity for reasons other than defaults for failure to comply with typical financial or payment covenants. For example, certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control (as defined in the agreement) of the borrower. In addition, certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business. Our European Credit Agreement also requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios, and one of such requirements is based on the ratio of net debt to the last twelve months EBITDA of the borrowers. The terms of all of our debt instruments are discussed in Note 8 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. We are in compliance with all of our debt covenants at June 30, 2017. We believe that we will be able to continue to comply with the financial covenants contained in our Credit Facilities through their maturity. In January 2017, we extended the maturity date of our North American Revolving Credit Facility to the earlier of (i) January 2022 or (ii) 90 days prior to the maturity date of our existing Term Loan Facility (or 90 days prior to the maturity date of any indebtedness incurred in a permitted refinancing of such existing Term Loan Facility). Our European Credit Facility matures in September 2017 and we believe we will be able to obtain an extension of this credit facility to September 2022 in the normal course of business on or prior to its maturity date. We expect to reduce the size of the European Credit Facility from €120.0 million to €90.0 million concurrent with the extension. -62 ----- At June 30, 2017, we had approximately $91.4 million available for additional borrowing under our North American Revolving Credit Facility. Based on the terms of our European Credit Facility (including the net debt to EBITDA financial test discussed above) and the borrowers’ EBITDA over the last twelve months ended June 30, 2017, the full €120.0 million amount of the European Credit Facility ($137.1 million based on the exchange rate as of June 30, 2017 of $1.1424 United States dollars per Euro) is available for borrowing at June 30, 2017. We could borrow all available amounts under each of our Credit Facilities without violating our existing debt covenants. Our assets consist primarily of investments in operating subsidiaries, and our ability to service parent-level obligations, including our Term Loan Facility, depends in part upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries, whether in the form of dividends, advances or payments on account of intercompany obligations or otherwise. Our Term Loan Facility is collateralized by, among other things, a first priority lien on (i) 100% of the common stock of certain of our United States wholly-owned subsidiaries, (ii) 65% of the common stock or other ownership interest of our Canadian subsidiary (Kronos Canada, Inc.) and certain first-tier European subsidiaries (Kronos Titan GmbH and Kronos Denmark ApS) and (iii) a $395.7 million unsecured promissory note issued by Kronos International, Inc., which will be satisfied in connection with the repayment of the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility is also collateralized by a second priority lien on our United States assets which collateralize our North American Revolving Credit Facility. Our North American Revolving Credit Facility is collateralized by, among other things, a first priority lien on the borrower’s trade receivables and inventories.

429,Offerings 2017.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.28,Defined Benefit Pension Plans,17.28.1,,"We maintain various defined benefit pension plans in the United States, Europe and Canada. See Note 10 to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Under defined benefit pension plan accounting, defined benefit pension plan expense, pension assets and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions. These assumptions are principally the assumed discount rate, the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels. We recognize the full funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as either an asset (for overfunded plans) or a liability (for underfunded plans) in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of $21.8 million in 2014, $23.4 million in 2015 and $22.0 million in 2016. Certain non-United States employees are covered by plans in their respective countries, principally in Germany, Canada and Norway. Participation in the defined benefit pension plan in Germany was closed to new participants effective in 2005. German employees hired beginning in 2005 participate in a new plan in which the retirement benefit is based -66 ----- upon the amount of employee and employer contributions to the plan, but for which in accordance with German law the employer guarantees a minimum rate of return on invested assets and a guaranteed indexed lifetime benefit payment after retirement based on the participant’s account balance at the time of retirement. In accordance with GAAP, the new pension plan is accounted for as a defined benefit plan, principally because of such guaranteed minimum rate of return and guaranteed lifetime benefit payment. Participation in the defined benefit plan in Canada with respect to hourly and salaried workers was closed to new participants in December 2013 and 2014, respectively, and existing hourly and salaried plan participants will no longer accrue additional defined pension benefits after December 2013 and 2014, respectively. Our United States plan was closed to new participants in 1996, and existing participants no longer accrued any additional benefits after that date. The amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations (such as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), in the United States) and will generally differ from pension expense for financial reporting purposes. We made contributions to all of our plans which aggregated $20.1 million in 2014, $17.2 million in 2015 and $15.5 million in 2016. The discount rates we use for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid. In addition, we receive third-party advice about appropriate discount rates and these advisors may in some cases use their own market indices. We adjust these discount rates as of each December 31 valuation date to reflect then-current interest rates on such long-term bonds. We use these discount rates to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of December 31 of that year. We also use these discount rates to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year. At December 31, 2016, approximately 69%, 17%, 8% and 3% of the projected benefit obligations related to our plans in Germany, Canada, Norway and the United States, respectively. We use several different discount rate assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligation and expense. This is because we maintain defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in Europe and North America and the interest rate environment differs from country to country.

Unlike the discount rate, which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long-term interest rates, the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual short-term performance of the plan assets in any given year. Defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan, the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year and an estimate of the amount of contributions to and distributions from the plan during the year. Differences -67 ----- between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants (for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees) or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants (for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees). At December 31, 2016, approximately 56%, 25%, 13% and 4% of the plan assets related to our plans in Germany, Canada, Norway and the United States, respectively. We use several different long-term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining our consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense. This is because the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long-term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions, we consider the long-term asset mix (e.g. equity vs. fixed income) for the assets for each of our plans and the expected long-term rates of return for such asset components. In addition, we receive third-party advice about appropriate long-term rates of return. All of the assets of our United States plan are invested in the Combined Master Retirement Trust (CMRT), a collective investment trust sponsored by Contran Corporation to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits sponsored by Contran and certain of its affiliates, including us.

To the extent that a plan’s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels, the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels. For all of our plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated, we generally base the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long-term inflation rates for the applicable country. In addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above, the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of net pension asset and net pension liability will vary based upon relative changes in currency exchange rates. A reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss, as the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase. Conversely, an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain. In addition, an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain, while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss. Other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions, such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables, which are also used to determine the actuarially-determined present value of estimated future benefit payments, changes in such mortality tables themselves or plan amendments, will also result in actuarial losses or gains. These amounts are recognized in other comprehensive income. In addition, any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses, while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains. During 2016, all of our defined benefit pension plans generated a combined net actuarial loss of approximately $38.0 million. This actuarial loss resulted primarily from the decrease in discount rates from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, and an actual return on plan assets during 2016 less than the expected return. Based on the actuarial assumptions described above and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during 2017, we expect our defined benefit pension expense will approximate $27 million in 2017. In comparison, we expect to be required to contribute approximately $15 million to such plans during 2017. As noted above, defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above. We believe all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate. However, if we had lowered the -69 ----- assumed discount rate by 25 basis points for all plans as of December 31, 2016, our aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately $28.9 million at that date and our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately $1.8 million during 2017. Similarly, if we lowered the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets by 25 basis points for all of our plans, our defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately $1.0 million during 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

We recognize the full unfunded status of our OPEB plans as a liability. See Note 10 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the consolidated OPEB cost we recognized during the last three years, the amount of our accrued OPEB costs, and the associated actuarial assumptions utilized. Based on such actuarial assumptions and our current expectation for what actual average currency exchange rates will be during 2017, we expect our consolidated OPEB expense will be nil in 2017.

Many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase, or specify a range of quantities within which we are required to purchase. Raw material pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly or semi-annually depending upon the suppliers. For certain raw material requirements we do not have long-term supply agreements either because we have assessed the risk of the unavailability of those raw materials and/or the risk of a significant change in the cost of those raw materials to be low, or because long-term supply agreements for those raw materials are generally not available.

Chlorine is available from a number of -82 ----- suppliers, while petroleum coke is available from a limited number of suppliers. Titaniumcontaining feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in Australia, South Africa, Canada, India and the United States.

We offer our customers a broad portfolio of products that include over 40 different TiO2 pigment grades under the Kronos[®] trademark, which improve whiteness, brightness, opacity and durability to meet customers’ specific requirements. Including our predecessors, we have produced and marketed TiO2 in North America and Europe for over 100 years and we believe we have developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture, sale, shipment and service of our products. We, along with our distributors and agents, sell and provide technical services for our products to approximately 4,000 customers in 100 countries with the majority of sales in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, we generated $1,501 million in sales and $234 million in EBITDA. TiO2 is a white inorganic pigment used in a wide range of products for its exceptional durability and its ability to impart whiteness, brightness and opacity. TiO2 is a critical component of everyday applications, such as coatings, plastics and paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, food and cosmetics. TiO2 is widely considered to be superior to alternative white pigments in large part due to its hiding power (or opacity), which is the ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently. TiO2 is designed, marketed and sold based on specific end-use applications. TiO2 is the largest commercially used whitening pigment because it has a high refractive rating, giving it more hiding power than any other commercially produced white pigment. In addition, TiO2 has excellent resistance to interaction with other chemicals, good thermal stability and resistance to ultraviolet degradation. Although there are other white pigments on the market, we believe there are no effective substitutes for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated in as cost-effective a manner. Pigment extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used together with TiO2 in a number of end-use markets. However, these products are not able to duplicate the opacity performance characteristics of TiO2 and we believe these products are unlikely to have a significant impact on the use of TiO2.

We estimate that we and our four principal competitors comprise approximately 57% of the world’s production. We have a broad -73 ----- and well-balanced portfolio of TiO2 product offerings and core technologies and, unlike some competitors, have the capability to produce TiO2 through both the chloride and sulfate process. This dual manufacturing capability enables us to meet our customers’ diverse needs and allows us flexibility in end market applications, thereby improving profitability. The chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile TiO2. The chloride process produces less waste than the sulfate process because much of the chlorine is recycled and feedstock bearing higher titanium content is used. The chloride process also has lower energy requirements and is less labor-intensive than the sulfate process, although the chloride process requires a higher-skilled labor force. The chloride process produces an intermediate base pigment with a wide range of properties. The chloride process is the preferred form to produce TiO2 pigments for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest enduse markets. The sulfate process is a batch process in which sulfuric acid is used to extract the TiO2 from ilmenite or titanium slag. After separation from the impurities in the ore (mainly iron), the TiO2 is precipitated and calcined to form an intermediate base pigment ready for sale or can be upgraded through finishing treatments. The sulfate process is preferred for use in selected paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, food products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, some of which generate higher profit margins. Some of the principal applications for our products include the following: _TiO2 for coatings—Our TiO2 is used to provide opacity, durability, tinting strength and_ brightness in industrial coatings, as well as coatings for commercial and residential interiors and exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings. The amount of TiO2 used in coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and quality desired. In general, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO2 content. _TiO2 for plastics—We produce TiO2 pigments that improve the optical and physical_ properties in plastics, including whiteness and opacity. TiO2 is used to provide opacity in items such as containers and packaging materials, and vinyl products such as windows, door profiles and siding. TiO2 also generally provides hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and surface durability for housewares, appliances, toys, computer cases and food packages. TiO2’s high brightness along with its opacity, is used in some engineering plastics to help mask their undesirable natural color. TiO2 is also used in masterbatch, which is a concentrate of TiO2 and other additives and is one of the largest uses for TiO2 in the plastics end-use market. In masterbatch, the TiO2 is dispersed at high concentrations into a plastic resin and is then used by manufacturers of plastic containers, bottles, packaging and agricultural films. _TiO2 for paper—Our TiO2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including_ laminate (decorative) paper, filled paper and coated paper to provide whiteness, brightness, opacity and color stability. Although we sell our TiO2 to all segments of the paper end-use market, our primary focus is on the TiO2 grades used in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together using melamine resin under high temperature and pressure. The top layer of paper contains TiO2 and plastic resin and is the layer that is printed with decorative patterns. Paper laminates are used to replace materials such as wood and tile for such applications as counter tops, furniture and wallboard. TiO2 is beneficial in these applications because it assists in preventing the material from fading or changing color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other weathering agents. -74 ----- _TiO2 for other applications—We produce TiO2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of_ printing inks. TiO2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical requirements of printing machinery, including low abrasion, high printing speed and high temperatures. Our TiO2 is also used in textile applications where TiO2 functions as an opacifying and delustering agent. In man-made fibers such as rayon and polyester, TiO2 corrects an otherwise undesirable glossy and translucent appearance. Without the presence of TiO2, these materials would be unsuitable for use in many textile applications. Our TiO2 business is enhanced by the following three complementary businesses, which comprised approximately 7% of our net sales in 2016: - We own and operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. Ilmenite is a raw material used directly as a feedstock by some sulfate-process TiO2 plants. We also sell ilmenite ore to third parties, some of whom are our competitors, and we sell an ilmenite-based specialty product to the oil and gas industry. The mines have estimated ilmenite reserves that we expect, based on internal estimates, to last at least 50 years. - We manufacture and sell iron-based chemicals, which are co-products and processed co-products of the sulfate and chloride process TiO2 pigment production. These coproduct chemicals are marketed through our Ecochem division and are primarily used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater as well as in the manufacture of iron pigments, cement and agricultural products. - We manufacture and sell titanium oxychloride and titanyl sulfate, which are side-stream specialty products from the production of TiO2. Titanium oxychloride is used in specialty applications in the formulation of pearlescent pigments, production of electroceramic capacitors for cell phones and other electronic devices. Titanyl sulfate productions are used in pearlescent pigments, natural gas pipe and other specialty applications. We operate facilities throughout North America and Europe, including the only sulfate process plant in North America. In addition, Kronos Louisiana, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, operates the most recent greenfield chloride process plant in the western world, Lake Charles, Louisiana, in a manufacturing joint venture with Huntsman P&A Investments LLC (“HPA”). Kronos Louisiana, Inc. and HPA each own a 50% interest in the joint venture and, unless otherwise agreed, Kronos Louisiana, Inc. and HPA share in production from the plant equally pursuant to separate offtake agreements. We are required to purchase one half of the TiO2 produced by the joint venture. All costs and capital expenditures are shared equally with HPA with the exception of feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag) and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced. We also own and operate the only ilmenite mines in Western Europe, enabling the Company to 100% vertically integrate its European sulfate process manufacturing operations. We use a wide range of titanium-containing feedstock which can be shipped efficiently and economically to our various manufacturing facilities to maintain cost competitiveness. The Company also has the ability to efficiently and economically ship pigment to fast growing regions such as Asia / Pacific and Central & South America. As a result of recent strategic initiatives and investments we have made, we have expanded our marketing efforts in these export markets and expect to benefit from ongoing economic growth and development in these areas of the world. -75 ----- Our production capacity in 2016 was 555,000 metric tons, approximately three-fourths of which was from the chloride production process.

The market for TiO2 is extremely competitive, and we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, technical service, price, and the availability of high performance pigment grades. Pricing is largely a product of negotiation between suppliers and their respective customers. Cost advantages are typically driven by scale of plants, proprietary process technology, production know-how and environmental regulations and, to a lesser extent, type of feedstock, source of energy, and cost of local labor. The primary raw materials used in sulfate and chloride process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock (including ilmenite, rutile, chloride and sulfate slag and synthetic rutile). The global market for titanium-bearing ores is diverse in terms of supplier options, and the market is structured by short and long-term contracts with market-based pricing subject to ongoing negotiations throughout each year, often on a quarterly basis. In the past we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to titanium-bearing ore supply contracts prior to their expiration. We believe there is more than ample global supply of titanium containing feedstock ore, and do not currently expect any difficulties in procuring sufficient quantities of ore necessary to operate our plants for the -76 ----- foreseeable future. Additionally, we have structured a portion of our feedstock contracts with pricing mechanisms in an attempt to reduce earnings volatility through all cycles. These procurement dynamics allow us to be flexible in response to pricing fluctuations and quantity obligations. Our vertically integrated structure in the sulfate production business provides further protection by allowing us to capture margin despite broader variability in pricing. As a critical component of everyday applications such as coatings, plastics, paper, and other specialty products, TiO2 is considered a “quality of life” product, and demand has generally been driven by global economic activity and GDP per capita. There is currently no effective substitute for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties capable of achieving comparable opacity and brightness in a cost-effective manner. As such, customer demands for TiO2 generally increase with rising standards of living in various regions of the world. Our customers also differentiate their finished products based on product quality which drives increased demand for TiO2, because of its superior performance attributes. According to industry estimates, TiO2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% since 1990. Per capita consumption of TiO2 in Western Europe and the United States far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO2 on a per capita basis. Markets for TiO2 are generally increasing in South America, Eastern Europe, the Asia Pacific region and China and we believe these are significant markets where we expect continued growth as economies in these regions continue to develop and quality-of-life products, including TiO2, experience greater demand. Historically, the TiO2 industry has been highly sensitive to supply and demand dynamics. Changes in TiO2 consumption levels and available production capacity result in changes to TiO2 industry operating rates and have a direct impact on our profitability. During 2010 and 2011, TiO2 demand reached levels that approximated estimated industry capacity, leading to a period of supply shortage and peak profitability. Beginning in 2012, the TiO2 industry experienced decreased sales and production volumes as the majority of TiO2 producers and consumers undertook inventory de-stocking initiatives in response to global economic weakness and uncertainty. As demand weakened, TiO2 industry operating rates declined, leading to declines in selling prices. At the same time, industry contracts for the procurement of feedstock ore generally switched from contracts with long-term fixed pricing mechanisms to pricing mechanisms more generally based on spot pricing. This transition was accompanied by significant increases in the cost of feedstock ore, which also led to reduced profitability until feedstock ore costs began to moderate beginning in 2015. Between 2013 and 2014, the TiO2 industry was characterized by flat sales volumes driven primarily by low demand and widespread destocking efforts. Profitability across the industry continued to lag in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 as producers experienced low utilization rates despite demand recovering. Since the first quarter of 2016, however, inventory levels and consumption patterns have stabilized and the industry has begun to see improvement in pricing as a result of growing demand levels and continued capacity rationalization. This positive momentum is expected to continue, driving additional upside relative to historically normalized price and margin levels. Although overall industry demand is expected to continue to strengthen through 2017 as a result of improving worldwide economic conditions, we do not expect any other significant efforts will be undertaken by us or our principal competitors to further increase capacity via new TiO2 plants or brownfield expansions in Europe or North America in the foreseeable future. Due to the constraints of high capital costs and extended lead time associated with adding significant new TiO2 production capacity, especially for premium grades of TiO2 products produced from the chloride process, we believe increased and sustained profit margins will be necessary to financially justify major expansions of TiO2 production capacity required to meet expected future growth in demand. As a result of relative customer inventory levels during the -77 ----- recent past and the resulting adverse effect on global TiO2 pricing, some industry projects to increase TiO2 production capacity have been cancelled or deferred indefinitely, and announcements have been made regarding the closure of certain facilities. Given the lead time required for production capacity expansions, a shortage of TiO2 could occur if economic conditions improve and global demand levels for TiO2 increase sufficiently.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

Industry data suggests that global TiO2 demand will have increased by approximately 9% between 2015 and 2017 while net production capacity increased by approximately 4%, creating an environment favorable for TiO2 price increases. The TiO2 markets are in the process of returning to more normalized levels following a period of reduced demand during the 2012—2014 time period, as discussed above. Various TiO2 key demand drivers are projected to remain strong, supporting continued sector strengthening. The Leading Indicator of Home Remodeling Activity is forecasted to increase 6.7% in 2017 and 2.0% per year through 2025; expected global GDP growth rates for 2017 and 2018 are 3.5% and 3.6%, respectively; end-use demand for coatings and plastics remain strong with IHS Chemical projecting 4.0% and 3.4% CAGRs for 2016-2021, respectively. If prices continue to increase in and beyond 2017, and as capacity utilization increases globally, TiO2 margins are expected to increase to more historically normalized levels. We started 2017 with average selling prices 10% higher than the beginning of 2016, and average selling prices increased by an additional 12% in the first half of 2017. Despite recent pricing momentum, prices remain significantly below prior peak levels. Following industry-wide increases in production volumes in 2016, most western TiO2 producers are running near 100% of practical capacity and TiO2 inventory levels have declined significantly at both the producer and customer level. With the strong sales volumes experienced in the first half of 2017, we continue to see evidence of strengthening demand for TiO2 products in our primary markets. TZMI projects future TiO2 price increases, reflecting continued positive industry outlook. In addition to our efforts to maximize profitability, current market conditions have allowed us to execute new long-term supply contracts with strategic customers to mitigate future volatility in pricing levels. We have exposure to both emerging and mature markets, and believe that our geographic mix positions us to take advantage of significant growth opportunities. We have invested in commercial, and sales and marketing resources in export markets by investing in distribution centers and by making a broad strategic commitment to building and firmly entrenching our presence in those areas. In order to do so, we have made efforts to improve these regional customer relationships, and have proactively shifted sales volumes to export customers in order to continue to strengthen our presence. We believe that long-term volumes in these geographies will drive value for the overall business through all cycles. _Leading Market Position Anchored in World Class Products and Production Technology_ We are one of the top five global producers of TiO2, the second largest TiO2 producer in Europe and the largest chloride process TiO2 ----- Approximately 75% of our production capacity utilizes the chloride process, which is closely guarded by the major western producers due to its technological advantages in many applications. In addition to the process know-how, the chloride process requires significant capital investments for greenfield expansions, uninterrupted power supplies and highly skilled labor forces, all of which have prevented emerging market participants from building meaningful chloride process capabilities. Additionally, the chloride process produces a high volume, high grade pigment, while providing lower total conversion costs through higher pigment yield, less waste, lower energy requirements and lower labor costs. Our typical chloride process cost structure is comprised of approximately 49% feedstock, 28% fixed cost, 9% utilities and 14% other raw materials. Since some of the traditional incentives for manufacturers to locate in China, such as relatively lower labor costs, are not as important for the chloride process, and the chloride process requires a stable, uninterrupted power supply (which may not be as prevalent in China as other parts of the world), the incentive for Chinese competitors to invest in chloride process technology is lessened. Therefore, western producers collectively produce approximately 90% of the world’s total chloride production, which we believe is superior in quality to Chinese TiO2, that is virtually all based on sulfate production processes and is typically used in different applications. Many coatings and plastics applications, which comprise over 80% of industry demand by volume, typically require the highest quality TiO2 that is only produced by the major western producers. We have world-class facilities throughout North America and Europe, including the most recent greenfield plant in the western world and the only sulfate process plant in North America. We and our predecessors have produced and marketed TiO2 in North America and Europe, our primary markets, for over 100 years. We believe the stability of our ownership structure (since 1986) provides multiple points of differentiation versus our competitors. Building on our history of innovation, we maintain a dedicated team of scientists, chemists, process engineers, and technicians. We offer a broad portfolio of products that include over 40 different grades of TiO2 for plastics and coatings by leveraging our dual chloride / sulfate process capabilities, in addition to continuously improving the quality of existing grades through our technical support department. Since 2012, we have added 4 new grades for pigments and other applications. We have increased production capacity by approximately 9.0% over the past ten years through innovative de-bottlenecking requiring only moderate capital expenditures, and it is reasonably likely we will set a new company record for production volumes in 2017. Unlike most competitors, all of our chloride process plants utilize the same technology, which enables improvements to be efficiently implemented in all plants at minimal cost. The aforementioned investments have enhanced Kronos’ ability to achieve economies of scale benefits. _Vertically Integrated Production Process; Security of Feedstock Supply_ Our raw material procurement capabilities and vertically integrated sulfate production configuration distinguish us from many of our peers. The primary raw materials used in the TiO2 sulfate production process are titanium-containing feedstock, primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag and sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid is widely available, titanium containing feedstock used in the sulfate process is distributed by a limited number of suppliers principally in Norway, Canada, Australia, India South Africa, and China. We are one of the few vertically integrated producers of sulfate-process pigments, with 100% vertical integration in our sulfate business in Europe (representing 22% of total production capacity). We own and operate two ilmenite mines in Norway which supplied all of our feedstock requirements for our European sulfate process plants and 93% of total feedstock needs for our sulfate process pigment plants globally in 2016. Based on internal estimates, we expect these reserves to last over 50 years, thereby meeting European feedstock requirements into the foreseeable future. -79 ----- Historically, sales to third parties have ranged from 45% to 70% of our ilmenite ore production, providing a natural hedge to fluctuations in feedstock prices. We have also established long-term relationships with third-party ore suppliers that provide a secure source of feedstock for all chloride process facilities, as well as the sulfate process line in Varennes, Quebec (which is not serviced by our Norwegian sources). We source feedstock from multiple suppliers, and over 70% of our third party chloride process feedstock requirements are purchased under long-term contracts (the remainder of our chloride process feedstock ore requirements are currently provided under contracts with a term of one year or less which are subject to renewal). We have a proven track record of securing sufficient feedstock to operate our plants due to our relationships with these suppliers and others. If approved, the proposed merger of Tronox and Cristal will result in only three material buyers of chloride process feedstock in the market (as Tronox’s internal feedstock ore sources would be expected to cover the majority of the needs of the combined entity), while the market is served by numerous suppliers. In addition, we have developed manufacturing processes that allow waste material from the sulfate TiO2 production to be converted into profitable iron-based chemical coproducts instead of being disposed, which helps us avoid additional expense. _Diversified Blue Chip Customer Base with Long-Term Relationships_ We sell to a diverse, blue chip customer base and benefit from long-standing relationships with top tier clients in all relevant end-markets. By leveraging a cross-functional, value-add technical service offering and direct sales force, we have developed strong connections with over 4,000 customers in 100 countries. Notably, we have minimal customer concentration risk; in 2016, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales and the largest 10 customers accounted for only 33% of total sales. The average tenure of our top tier customers exceeds 10 years. The Company continues to strengthen its customer relationships by working directly with customers to monitor the success of its products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions. _Longstanding Track Record of Prudent Balance Sheet Management_ Our management team has demonstrated a consistent ability to efficiently service our debt through earnings volatility, while preserving operating flexibility. These efforts have allowed us to maintain a strong liquidity position, while maintaining a conservative amount of debt as a percentage of total enterprise value. At the same time, we continue to invest in the business through capital expenditures to maintain existing infrastructure and execute incremental projects, including cost-cutting initiatives and de-bottlenecking projects. While we use excess cash flow to pay dividends to shareholders, management has shown commitment to capital discipline. During the global recession, for example, we suspended all dividends for seven quarters to conserve cash and ensure the Company was in solid financial condition. Our balance sheet conservatism is in-line with our long-term ownership structure. _Seasoned Management Team with Exceptional Industry Expertise_ Our management team is composed of individuals with deep industry experience and strong leadership capabilities. Members of the management team boast an average of over 15 years of experience with the Company (ranging from 5 to 29 years). In addition to a corporate leadership function that provides strategic direction in finance, legal, accounting, marketing services and other areas, we rely on an operational leadership team, comprised of the most -80 ----- senior operations managers, to oversee complex facility operations. The combination of these leadership mechanisms ensures seamless execution of our strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

As a result, we have consistently generated positive cash from operations despite historical TiO2 sector volatility. Our cost structure is optimized at full production levels and as such, we target production levels at 100% of practical capacity, subject to market demand. Our goal is to achieve these targets by ensuring we have maximum product demand and reliable production assets, The flexibility associated with our chloride and sulfate process capabilities and our vast and diverse product portfolio allow us to shift into different end markets beyond coatings and plastics depending on demand trends, thereby helping us to maintain relatively high production capacity utilization rates. We intend to continue production rates in-line with recent levels. We actively manage our working capital balances by optimizing manufacturing schedules, increasing inventory turnover and reducing finished goods and raw materials inventory. Our vertical integration in Europe enables us to further harmonize the raw material and pigment production schedules. Our working capital balances typically act as a counter balance to our earnings results in order to smooth cash generation through the cycle. We plan to make capital expenditures required to maintain and improve the overall performance, safety and reliability of our manufacturing asset base as well as implement new accounting and manufacturing systems. We intend to optimize capital spending on growth and cost reduction projects. _Continue to Drive Operational Efficiencies Across the Enterprise_ Our management team is focused on driving continuous improvement in our cost structure and process productivity improvements in order to grow shareholder value. Historically, we have taken decisive action in response to industry conditions, undertaken proactive efforts to mitigate fixed cost inflation, and made disciplined investments in production capabilities to support our growth. We regularly seek opportunities for further improvements across our Company. In 2015 we initiated a restructuring plan designed to improve our long-term cost structure, which resulted in approximately $19 million of annual cost savings. These workforce reductions did not negatively impact our ability to operate our production facilities at their practical capacity rates, as evidenced by the production levels we achieved in 2016 and our anticipated record production in 2017. Through careful planning and an organizational re-design, we are in the process of implementing other cost reduction initiatives throughout the organization that are expected to generate additional savings through 2020 and beyond, with minimal to no impact on our operational and commercial capabilities. We also actively invest in process productivity improvements. We have increased our production capacity by a CAGR of 2.0% since 1995 through innovative production debottlenecking and process engineering enhancements without any brownfield or greenfield investments since 1992. Unlike most competitors, all of our chloride process plants utilize the -81 ----- same technology, which enables improvements to be efficiently implemented in all plants at minimal costs. We continue to seek opportunities to increase our production capacity through high return capital investments. _Maintain Strong Customer Focus_ Our customer strategy is aimed at developing and maintaining strong customer relationships with new and existing accounts. We work to maintain close relationships with the key decision makers, through in-depth and frequent in-person meetings. We endeavor to extend these commercial and technical relationships to multiple levels within our customers’ organization using our experienced direct sales force and technical service group to accomplish this objective. We believe this has helped build customer loyalty to Kronos and strengthened our competitive position vs. our competitors. Close cooperation and strong customer relationships enable us to stay closely attuned to trends in our customers’ businesses. Where appropriate, we work in conjunction with our customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying specific product properties or developing new pigment grades Our marketing strategy is also aimed at working directly with customers to monitor the success of our products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions for our customers. Our marketing staff closely coordinates with our sales force and technical specialists to ensure that the needs of our customers are met, and to help develop and commercialize new grades where appropriate. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on those geographic and end-use segments where the Company can realize higher selling prices. This focus includes continuously reviewing and optimizing our customer and product portfolios.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

These environmental laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. Certain of our operations are, or have been, engaged in the generation, storage, handling, manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations. As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of our past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage. We have implemented and continue to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks. Our policy is to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all our facilities and to strive to improve our environmental performance. It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies, could adversely affect our operations, including production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or require us to make capital and other expenditures to comply, and could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity. Our United States manufacturing operations are governed by federal, state and local environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, or CERCLA, as well as the state counterparts of these statutes. Some of these laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not know of, and were not responsible for, such contamination. These laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person. Although we have not incurred and do not currently anticipate any material liabilities in connection with such environmental laws, we may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future. While the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in Europe vary from country to country, a common regulatory framework is provided by the European Union, or the EU. Germany and Belgium are members of the EU and follow its initiatives. Norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the EU. At our sulfate plant facilities in Germany, we recycle spent sulfuric acid either through contracts with third parties or at our own facilities. In addition, at our German locations we have a contract with a third-party to treat certain sulfate-process effluents. At our Norwegian plant, we ship spent acid to a third party location where it is used as a neutralization agent.

Under the ISAs, employees of one company provide certain services, including executive officer services, to the other company on an annual fixed fee basis. The services rendered under the ISAs may include executive, management, financial, internal audit, accounting, tax, legal, insurance, real estate management, environmental management, risk management, treasury, human resources, technical, consulting, administrative, office, occupancy and other services as required from time to time in the ordinary course of the recipient’s business. The fees paid pursuant to the ISAs are generally based upon an estimated percentage of the time devoted by employees of the provider of the services to the business of the recipient and the employer’s cost related to such employees, which includes the expense for the employees’ compensation and an overhead component that takes into account other employment related costs. Generally, each of the ISAs renews on a quarterly basis subject to termination by either party pursuant to a written notice delivered 30 days prior to the start of the next quarter. Because of the number of companies related to Contran and us, we believe we benefit from cost savings and economies of scale gained by not having certain management, financial, legal, tax, real estate and administrative staffs duplicated at each company, thus allowing certain individuals to provide services to multiple companies.

429,Offerings 2017.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.87,Risk Management Program,17.87.1,,"We and Contran participate in a combined risk management program. Pursuant to the program, Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and related entities, including us and certain of our subsidiaries and related entities, as a group, purchase insurance policies and risk management services. The program apportions its costs among the participating companies. Tall Pines Insurance Company (“Tall Pines”) and EWI Re, Inc. (“EWI”) provide for or broker the insurance policies. Tall Pines purchases reinsurance for substantially all of the risks it underwrites. EWI also provides claims and risk management services and, where appropriate, engages certain third-party risk management consultants. Tall Pines is a captive insurance company wholly owned by Valhi. EWI is a reinsurance brokerage and risk management company wholly owned by NL. Tall Pines purchases reinsurance from third-party insurance carriers with an A.M. Best Company rating of generally at least an “A-” (excellent) for substantially all of the risks it underwrites. Consistent with insurance industry practices, Tall Pines and EWI receive commissions from insurance and reinsurance underwriters and/or assess fees for the policies that they provide or broker. With respect to certain of such jointly owned insurance policies, it is possible that unusually large losses incurred by one or more insureds during a given policy period could leave the other participating companies without adequate coverage under that policy for the balance of the policy period. As a result, and in the event that the available coverage under a particular policy would become exhausted by one or more claims, Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including us, have entered into a loss sharing agreement under which any uninsured loss arising because the available coverage had been exhausted by one or more claims will be shared ratably amongst those entities that had submitted claims under the relevant policy. We believe the benefits in the form of reduced premiums and broader coverage associated with the group coverage for such policies justify the risk associated with the potential for any uninsured loss. During 2016, we paid Tall Pines and EWI in the aggregate approximately $9.2 million, including approximately $2.4 million paid by Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., a partnership of which one of our wholly owned subsidiaries and a subsidiary of Venator Materials PLC Corporation each owns 50%. These amounts principally represent payments for insurance premiums, including premiums or fees paid to Tall Pines and commissions or fees paid to EWI. These amounts also include payments to insurers or reinsurers through EWI for the reimbursement of claims within our applicable deductible or retention ranges that such insurers and reinsurers paid to third parties on our behalf, as well as amounts for claims and risk management services and various other third-party fees and expenses incurred by the program. We expect these relationships with Tall Pines and EWI will continue in 2017. In October 2016, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our participation in the combined risk management program. Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above): - the premiums for all of the insurance and reinsurance policies are set by third parties (the underwriters for the insurance or reinsurance carriers bearing the risk), without any markup by Tall Pines or EWI; -96 ----- - the method by which the insurance premiums are allocated among the companies participating in the risk management program is generally the same as the basis used by the insurance or reinsurance carriers to establish the premiums for such insurance/ reinsurance (i.e. the dominant premium factor, which is the factor that has the greatest impact on the premium, such as revenues, payroll or employee headcount); - EWI provides claims and risk management services to each of the companies participating in the risk management program, including us, and where appropriate EWI engages third-party risk management consultants; - the commissions received by Tall Pines and EWI from the insurance or reinsurance underwriters, and the fees assessed for the policies they so provide or broker, are in amounts equal to the commissions or fees which would be received by third-party brokers or underwriters; - the insurance coverages provided to us by the risk management program are sufficient and adequate for our purposes; - the benefits to our participating in the risk management program include, among others, (a) the ability to obtain broader coverage, with strong/solvent underwriters, at a reduced cost as compared to the coverage and cost that would be available if we were to purchase insurance by itself, (b) the greater spread of risk among the companies participating in the risk management program, (c) the ability to obtain centralized premium and claim reporting, and (d) the ability to have access to the experienced risk management personnel of EWI, including in the areas of loss controls and claims processing; and - the “cost of risk” metric, as defined by the Risk and Insurance Management Society, or RIMS, for the Contran group is lower as compared to the cost of risk as reflected in a recent RIMS benchmark survey for certain groups of companies comparable to the Contran group. As part of such presentations, our chief financial officer, after consultation with other members of our management, advised the committee of his belief that our participation in the risk management program, including the allocation of its costs among us and the other entities participating in the risk management program, is fair and reasonable to us, and is on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, and provided the committee with his recommendation that the committee approve, adopt and ratify our participation in the risk management program in all respects.

Refunds are limited to amounts previously paid under the tax sharing agreement. We and our qualifying subsidiaries are also a part of consolidated tax returns filed by Contran in certain United States state jurisdictions, and the terms of the tax sharing agreement also apply to state payments to these jurisdictions. Under applicable law, we, as well as every other member of the Contran Tax Group, are each jointly and severally liable for the aggregate federal income tax liability of Contran and the other companies included in the group for all periods in which we are included in the group. Under our tax sharing agreement, Valhi has agreed to indemnify us for any liability for income taxes of the Contran Tax Group in excess of our tax liability previously computed and paid by us in accordance with the tax sharing agreement. Under certain circumstances, tax regulations could require Contran to treat items differently than we would have treated them on a stand-alone basis. In such instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to conform to Contran’s tax elections. For 2016, and pursuant to our tax sharing agreement, we made net cash payments for income taxes to Valhi of approximately $0.8 million.

When we have outstanding indebtedness, we may still decide to enter into a loan to a related party either because the interest rate on the loan to the related party is at a higher rate of return as compared to the interest rate we are paying on our outstanding indebtedness, or the funds we would be loaning to the related party would not otherwise be used to paydown the outstanding indebtedness (such as, for example, in the case when the outstanding indebtedness has a maturity longer than the maturity of the loan to the related party). When we borrow from related parties, we are generally able to pay a lower rate of interest than we would pay if we borrowed from unrelated parties. During 2016, we had an unsecured revolving promissory note with Valhi whereby we agreed to loan Valhi up to $60 million. Our loan to Valhi, as amended, bears interest at the prime rate plus 1.00%, payable quarterly and all principal and unpaid interest due on demand, but in any event no earlier than December 31, 2018. The principal amount of our outstanding loans to Valhi at any time is at our discretion. During 2016, we had no outstanding loans to Valhi under this promissory note, and we received unused commitment fees from Valhi under this note of approximately $0.4 million. In February 2017, our management made a presentation to our audit committee regarding our loan to Valhi. Among other things during such presentation, the committee was informed of the following (in addition to the matters described above): - While Valhi has not borrowed any amounts in the last two years, we receive an unused commitment fee of 50 basis points per annum, payable quarterly; - The interest rate we would earn on any outstanding borrowings by Valhi would be higher than the rate of return we would earn on any of our funds available for investment; - The interest rate we would earn on any outstanding borrowings by Valhi would be an interest rate no less than (and generally greater than) the interest rate which a lender would be earning under either our North American Revolving Credit Facility or the revolving credit facility of two of our competitors; and - Any amounts we might loan to Valhi would not otherwise be used to paydown the outstanding balance of our term loan indebtedness, in part since the maturity date of such term loan is over two years in excess of the maturity date of our loan to Valhi. As part of such presentation, our chief financial officer, after consultation with our treasurer and other members of our management, advised the committee of his belief that the terms of our loan to Valhi are fair and reasonable to us, and are on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, and provided the committee with his recommendation that the committee approve, adopt and ratify our loan to Valhi in all respects. After considering the information contained in the presentation, including the recommendation of our chief financial officer, and following further discussion and review by the audit committee, our audit committee determined that the terms of our loan to Valhi are fair and reasonable to us, and are on terms no less favorable than we could otherwise obtain from unrelated parties, in each case based on the collective business judgment and experience of members of the committee, and the committee approved, adopted and ratified our loan to Valhi in all respects. -99 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

Based on the February 2020 maturity date of our existing Term Loan Facility, the maturity date of the North American Revolving Credit Facility is currently November 2019. After giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds related thereto, the maturity date of the North American Revolving Credit Agreement will be January 20, 2022. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to repay amounts currently outstanding under the North American Revolving Credit Facility (without terminating any commitments thereunder).

Any amounts outstanding under the North American Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.0% or at the applicable base rate, as defined in the agreement, plus a margin ranging from .5% to 1.0%. The North American Revolving Credit Facility is collateralized by, among other things, a first priority lien on the borrowers’ trade receivables and inventories. The North American Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of covenants and restrictions which, among other things, restricts the borrowers’ ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, pay dividends or merge or consolidate with, or sell or transfer all or substantially all of their assets to, another entity, contains other provisions and restrictive covenants customary in lending transactions of this type and under certain conditions requires the maintenance of a specified financial covenant (fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the North American Revolving Credit Agreement) to be at least 1.0 to 1.0. We had no borrowings or repayments under the North American Revolving Credit Facility during 2015. During 2016, we borrowed $266.2 million and repaid $266.2 million under the North American Revolving Credit Facility. During the first six months of 2017, we borrowed $160.8 million and repaid $144.5 million under the North American Revolving Credit Facility.

In addition, during the course of the bankruptcy case, a secured party may be entitled to seek adequate protection of its interest in its collateral to compensate it for any diminution in value caused by the debtor’s use, sale, lease, or detention of such collateral. If the secured party is found to be entitled to adequate protection, the form of protection will be determined by agreement with the debtor or by order of the bankruptcy court. Adequate protection can consist of replacement or additional collateral, or cash payments, among other things. Each case is different and whether adequate protection will be ordered by the bankruptcy court and the form the protection might take will vary with the facts of each case. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Notes Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Notes Collateral to which the Holders are entitled, and unsecured deficiency claims with respect to such shortfall.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. Notes purchased by the Issuer pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will have the status of Notes issued but not outstanding or will be retired and cancelled at the option of the Issuer. Notes purchased by a third party pursuant to the preceding paragraph will have the status of Notes issued and outstanding. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and we, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of us as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, we or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable Redemption Date. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase by the Issuer of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent permitted by law, -117 ----- (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by them or portions thereof properly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered and not withdrawn; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent for cancellation the Notes so accepted and not withdrawn together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee and Paying Agent stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer. The North American Revolving Credit Agreement limits, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which Parent or the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, could seek the consent of its lenders to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements. The North American Revolving Credit Agreement provides, and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to senior indebtedness to which Parent or the Issuer becomes a party may provide, that certain change of control events with respect to Parent or the Issuer would constitute a default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). If we experience a change of control that triggers a default thereunder, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance such Indebtedness. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance such Indebtedness, such default could result in amounts outstanding under such Indebtedness being declared due and payable. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness, the Notes and the Guarantees—We may be unable to finance a change of control offer.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Initial Purchaser and us. After the Issue Date, we have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. -118 ----- The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Parent. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. _Asset Sales_ The Indenture will provide that Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer) to, consummate an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value as determined in good faith by Parent (such fair market value to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of Cash Equivalents; provided that the amount of: (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by Parent) of the Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms expressly subordinated to the Notes or the Guarantees), that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets or that are otherwise cancelled or terminated in connection with the transaction with such transferee and for which Parent and all of its Restricted Subsidiaries have been validly released by all creditors in writing, (b) any securities, notes or other obligations or assets received by Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the Cash Equivalents received) within 365 days following the closing of such Asset Sale, and (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed 2.50% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-cash Consideration, with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall in each case be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for purposes of this provision and for no other purpose. -119 ----- Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale, Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, at Parent’s option or such Restricted Subsidiary, may apply the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (1) to the extent such Net Proceeds represent proceeds from an Asset Sale of Notes Collateral, (a) to repay, prepay, defease, redeem, purchase or otherwise retire the Notes and Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt (and if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that, with respect to this clause (a), to the extent Parent reduces Obligations under any Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt, Parent shall equally and ratably prepay, repay, redeem, reduce or purchase (or offer to prepay, repay, redeem, reduce or purchase, as applicable) Obligations under the Notes on a pro rata basis; provided, further, that all reductions of Obligations under the Notes shall be made as provided under “—Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption) or by an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; or (b) to make an investment in (i) any one or more businesses primarily engaged in a Similar Business; provided that such investment in any business is in the form of (x) a merger with Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, (y) the acquisition of Capital Stock that results in Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary or (z) the acquisition of Capital Stock or other assets of such business, (ii) properties, (iii) capital expenditures and (iv) the acquisition of Capital Stock or other assets, that in each of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), are used or useful in a Similar Business or replace the businesses, properties and assets that are subject of such Asset Sale, and in each case, such investment shall result in the Capital Stock or other assets acquired being owned by an entity whose Capital Stock constitutes Notes Collateral; (2) to the extent that such Net Proceeds do not represent proceeds from an Asset Sale of Notes Collateral, to repay, prepay, defease, redeem, purchase otherwise retire (a) Secured Indebtedness (other than Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt), and if such Secured Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto, (b) Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, other than Indebtedness owing to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent, and if such Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto and/or (c) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Guarantees, in each case owing to a person other than Parent or any Affiliate of Parent; provided that, with respect to this clause (c), Parent shall equally and ratably prepay, repay, redeem, reduce or purchase (or offer to prepay, repay, redeem, reduce or purchase, as applicable) Obligations under the Notes (and may elect to reduce other non-subordinated Indebtedness) on a pro rata basis; provided, further, that all reductions of Obligations under the Notes shall be made as provided under “—Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption) or by an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase their Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of redemption, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; -120 ----- (3) to the extent that such Net Proceeds do not represent proceeds from an Asset Sale of Notes Collateral, to make an Investment in (a) any one or more businesses; provided that such Investment in any business is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock and results in Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, owning an amount of the Capital Stock of such business such that it constitutes a Restricted Subsidiary, (b) properties or (c) other assets that, in the case of each of (a), (b) and (c), are used or useful in a Similar Business or replace the businesses, properties and/or other assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or (4) any combination of the foregoing; _provided that, in the case of clauses (1)(b) and (3) above, a binding commitment entered into_ within such 365 day period shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as Parent or such other Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds (as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) to the extent that any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sale by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) are prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated to the United States, the amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to the United States (Parent hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law to permit such repatriation), and if such repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, an amount equal to such Net Proceeds permitted to be repatriated will be applied (whether or not repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant (net of any additional taxes that are or would be payable or reserved against as a result thereof) and (ii) to the extent that Parent has determined in good faith that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition could have a material adverse tax consequence (which for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any purchase whereby doing so Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates and/or equity partners would incur a material tax liability, including a material tax dividend, material deemed dividend pursuant to Code Section 956 or material withholding tax), the amount equal to the Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent this covenant relates to Net Proceeds realized by any Excluded Subsidiary, this covenant shall be an obligation of Parent (and not such Excluded Subsidiary) to make a payment or an offer to purchase, in each case, measured by the amount of such Net Proceeds and nothing in this “Asset Sales” covenant shall be construed as an obligation of any Excluded Subsidiary to make a payment or repatriate any Net Proceeds (or to effect an offer to purchase) or an obligation of the Issuer or any Guarantor to cause an Excluded Subsidiary to make a payment or repatriate Net Proceeds (or effect an offer to purchase). Any Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the preceding paragraph (it being understood that any portion of such Net Proceeds used to make an offer to purchase Notes, as described in clause (1) above, will be deemed to have been invested whether or not such offer is accepted) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds from one or -121 ----- more Asset Sales exceeds $30.0 million, the Issuer shall make an offer to all Holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt, to the holders of such Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt (an “Asset Sale Offer”), on a pro rata basis, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Notes and such Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt that is at least €100,000 and an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. Parent or the Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within twenty (20) Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds so exceed $30.0 million by sending the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or the relevant clearing system. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, Parent or Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to compliance with other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes or the Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt surrendered in an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee and Paying Agent shall select the Notes and such Permitted Additional Notes Priority Debt to be purchased in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice” below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Proceeds may apply such Net Proceeds temporarily to reduce Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. Parent and the Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, Parent and the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The North American Revolving Credit Agreement limits, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which Parent or the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

Notices of purchase or redemption shall be mailed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the date of purchase or Redemption Date to each Holder of record of Notes at such Holder’s registered address or (otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) (with a copy to the Trustee and Paying Agent), except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, any notice of purchase or redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased or redeemed. The Issuer will issue a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Note called for redemption or tendered for purchase in the name of the Holder upon cancellation of the redeemed or purchased Note. Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption unless the Issuer defaults in the payment.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289
429,Offerings 2017.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.22,Certain Covenants,59.22.1,,"Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. _Covenant Suspension_ If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture then, beginning on that day and continuing at all times thereafter until the Reversion Date (as defined below) (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” (collectively, the “Suspended _Covenants” and each individually, a “Suspended Covenant”) will not be applicable to the Notes:_ (1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”; (2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”; (3) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; (4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”; (5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”; and (6) “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”. During a Suspension Period, Parent may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. If and while Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture for any period of time as a result of the foregoing, and on any subsequent date (the “Reversion Date”) that the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating from either of the Rating Agencies, then Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to -123 ----- future events. The period beginning on the day of a Covenant Suspension Event and ending on a Reversion Date is called a “Suspension Period.” On each Reversion Date, all Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date (or thereafter) under any Suspended Covenant solely as a result of any actions taken by Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries, or events occurring, during the Suspension Period. On and after each Reversion Date, Parent and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period (and not in contemplation of the Reversion Date) so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. For purposes of the “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales” covenant, on the Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero. For purposes of the “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries” covenant, on the Reversion Date, any contractual encumbrances or restrictions of the type specified in clause (1), (2) or (3) of that covenant entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect on the Issue Date, so that they are permitted under clause (a) under “—Dividend and other Payment Restrictions Affecting NonGuarantor Restricted Subsidiaries.” For purposes of the “—Transactions with Affiliates” covenant, any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to a contract, agreement, arrangement, loan, advance or guaranty with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of Parent entered into during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been in effect as of the Issue Date for purposes of clause (4) under “—Transactions with Affiliates.” There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating. Parent shall deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate notifying it of the commencement or termination of any Suspension Period. The Trustee shall have no independent obligation to determine if a Suspension Period has commenced or terminated, to notify the Holders regarding the same or to determine the consequences thereof. _Limitation on Restricted Payments_ Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer) to, directly or indirectly: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or any distribution on account of Parent’s, or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (in each case, solely in such Person’s capacity as holder of such Equity Interests), including any dividend or distribution payable in connection with any merger or consolidation other than: -124 ----- (a) dividends or distributions by Parent payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent; or (b) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary other than a Wholly Owned Subsidiary, Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of securities; (2) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of Parent, including in connection with any merger or consolidation, in each case held by Persons other than Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary; (3) make any principal payment on, or redeem, repurchase, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, in each case prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor, other than: (a) Indebtedness permitted under clauses (7) and (8) of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; or (b) the payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement for value of Subordinated Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one year of the date of such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement; or (4) make any Restricted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as “Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of such Restricted Payment: (1) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, Parent could incur $1.00 of additional Indebtedness under the provisions of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”; and (3) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the Issue Date (including Restricted Payments permitted by clause (1) of the next succeeding paragraph, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2) through (11) in the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum of (without duplication): (a) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income of Parent for the period (taken as one accounting period) beginning on the first day of the fiscal quarter in which the Issue Date occurs to the end of Parent’s most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment, or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit; _provided that for purposes of this clause (a), the aggregate provision or benefit for_ income taxes used to calculate Consolidated Net Income for any period after the first day of the fiscal quarter in which the Issue Date occurs in accordance with GAAP shall be replaced with income taxes paid (or received) in cash; plus -125 ----- (b) 100% of the aggregate net cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by Parent, of marketable securities or other property (other than cash) received by Parent since the Issue Date from the issue or sale of: (i) Equity Interests of Parent, excluding cash proceeds and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by Parent, of marketable securities or other property received from the sale of Equity Interests to any future, present or former employee, officer, director, member of management or consultant (or the estate, heirs, family members, spouse, former spouse, domestic partner or former domestic partner of any of the foregoing) of Parent since the Issue Date to the extent such amounts have been applied to Restricted Payments made in accordance with clause (4) of the next succeeding paragraph; and (ii) debt of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary that has been converted into or exchanged for Equity Interests of Parent; _provided, however, that this clause (b) shall not include the proceeds from (X) Equity_ Interests or convertible debt securities of Parent sold to a Restricted Subsidiary, and (Y) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock; plus (c) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by Parent, of marketable securities or other property (other than cash) contributed to the capital of Parent following the Issue Date (other than (i) by a Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) Disqualified Stock or debt securities that have been converted into Disqualified Stock); plus (d) 100% of the aggregate amount received in cash and the fair market value, as determined in good faith by Parent, of marketable securities or other property (other than cash) received by means of: (i) the sale or other disposition (other than to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) of Restricted Investments made by Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries, repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries, repayments of loans or advances, releases of guarantees, which constitute Restricted Investments by Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries, return of capital, income, profits and other amounts realized as a return on Investment from any Restricted Investment by Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case since the Issue Date (other than in each case to the extent the Restricted Investment was made in an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to clauses (7) or (8) of the next succeeding paragraph); (ii) the sale or other distribution (other than to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) of the stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary (other than in each case to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clauses (7) or (8) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment under clause (12) of such definition) or a dividend or distribution from an Unrestricted Subsidiary since the Issue Date; plus (e) in the case of the redesignation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or the merger, amalgamation or consolidation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary into Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue -126 ----- Date, the fair market value of the Investment of Parent or the Restricted Subsidiary in such Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time of such redesignation or at the time of such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or transfer of assets (or the assets transferred or conveyed, as applicable), as determined by Parent in good faith or, if such fair market value may exceed $25.0 million, by the board of directors of Parent, a copy of the resolution of which with respect thereto will be delivered to the Trustee at the time of the redesignation of such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of such merger, amalgamation, consolidation or transfer of assets other than to the extent the Investment in such Unrestricted Subsidiary was made by Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to clauses (7) or (8) of the next succeeding paragraph or to the extent such Investment constituted a Permitted Investment under clause (12) of such definition; plus (f) $175.0 million. The foregoing provisions will not prohibit: (1) the payment of any dividend or distribution or the consummation of any irrevocable redemption within 60 days after the date of declaration of the dividend or other distribution or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or distribution such dividend, distribution or redemption payment would have complied with the provisions of the Indenture (assuming, in the case of a redemption payment, the giving of the notice would have been deemed a Restricted Payment at such time and such deemed Restricted Payment would have been permitted at such time); (2) the payment of any dividend or distribution by any of Parent’s Restricted Subsidiaries to the holders of its Equity Interests on a pro rata basis; (3) the principal payment on, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, exchange or other acquisition or retirement of (x) Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the sale of, new Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or (y) Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Guarantor made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the sale of, Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Guarantor, that, in each case, is made within 120 days of such sale and is incurred in compliance with “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” so long as: (a) the principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of such new Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such new Disqualified Stock does not exceed the principal amount of (or accreted value, if applicable), plus any accrued and unpaid interest on, the Subordinated Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on, the Disqualified Stock being so repaid, repurchased, redeemed, defeased, exchanged, acquired or retired for value, plus the amount of any premium required to be paid under the terms of the instrument governing the Subordinated Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock being so repaid, repurchased, redeemed, defeased, exchanged, acquired or retired, any tender premiums, plus any defeasance costs, accrued interest and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront or similar fees) incurred in connection therewith;

(4) a Restricted Payment to pay for the repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition or retirement for value of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary held by any future, present or former employee, officer, director, member of management, manager or consultant (or the estate, heirs, family members, spouse, former spouse, domestic partner or former domestic partner of any of the foregoing) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, pursuant to any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee benefit plan or other agreement or arrangement, including, without limitation, severance payments in connection with the death, disability, or termination of employment or consultancy of any of the foregoing Persons (and including, for the avoidance of doubt, any principal and interest payable on any notes issued by Parent in connection with any such repurchase, retirement or other acquisition and any tax related thereto); provided, however, that the aggregate amounts made under this clause (4) do not exceed $5.0 million in any calendar year; provided that any unused amounts in any calendar year may be carried forward to one or more future calendar years; provided, further, that such amount in any calendar year may be increased by an amount not to exceed: (a) the cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent or Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case to any future, present or former employee, officer, director, member of management, manager or consultant (or the estate, heirs, family members, spouse, former spouse, domestic partner or former domestic partner of any of the foregoing) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent the cash proceeds from the sale of such Equity Interests have not otherwise been applied to the payment of Restricted Payments by virtue of clause (3) of the preceding paragraph; plus, in respect of any sale of Equity Interests in connection with an exercise of stock options, an amount equal to the amount required to be withheld by Parent in connection with such exercise under applicable law to the extent such amount is repaid to Parent constituted a Restricted Payment and has not otherwise been applied to the payment of Restricted Payments by virtue of clause (3) of the preceding paragraph;

As of the Issue Date, all of Parent’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. Parent will not permit any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary except pursuant to the second to last sentence of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries (except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Investments in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will be permitted only if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time, whether pursuant to the first paragraph of this section or clauses (7) or (8) of the second paragraph of this section or pursuant to the definition of Permitted Investment and if such Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

(7) Indebtedness of Parent to a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that any such Indebtedness owing to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or the Issuer is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes to the extent that such subordination is permitted by applicable law; provided, further, that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event which results in any Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to Parent or another Restricted Subsidiary or any pledge of such Indebtedness constituting a Permitted Lien) shall be deemed, in each case, to be an incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (7); (8) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary to Parent or another Restricted Subsidiary; _provided that if a Guarantor or Issuer incurs such Indebtedness to a Restricted Subsidiary_ -131 ----- that is not a Guarantor or the Issuer, such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee of the Notes of such Guarantor to the extent that such subordination is permitted by applicable law;

provided that any Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to this clause (12) shall cease to be deemed incurred, issued or outstanding for purposes of this clause (12) but shall be deemed incurred or issued for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which the Parent, the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor could have incurred such Indebtedness or issued such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on this clause (12); (13) the incurrence by Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock or the issuance by any Restricted Subsidiary of Preferred Stock which serves to extend, replace, refund, refinance, renew or defease any Indebtedness incurred (including any existing commitments unutilized thereunder) or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued as permitted under the first paragraph of this covenant and clauses (2), (3) and (4) above, this clause (13) and clause (14) below or any Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to so extend, replace, refund, refinance or renew such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock including additional Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to pay accrued interest and dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs and fees -132 ----- and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection therewith (the “Refinancing Indebtedness”) prior to its respective maturity; provided, _however, that such Refinancing Indebtedness:_ (a) has a Weighted Average Life to Maturity at the time such Refinancing Indebtedness is incurred or issued which is not less than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being extended, replaced, refunded, refinanced, renewed or defeased (except by virtue of prepayment of such Indebtedness), (b) to the extent such Refinancing Indebtedness extends, replaces, refunds, refinances, renews or defeases (i) Indebtedness subordinated to or pari passu with the Notes or any Guarantee thereof, such Refinancing Indebtedness is subordinated to or pari _passu with the Notes or the Guarantee at least to the same extent as the Indebtedness_ being extended, replaced, refunded, refinanced, renewed or defeased, (ii) Indebtedness secured by Liens junior in priority to the Liens securing the Notes or any Guarantee, such Refinancing Indebtedness is secured by Liens junior in priority to the Liens securing the Notes or such Guarantee or (iii) Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, such Refinancing Indebtedness must be Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, respectively, (c) shall not include: (i) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of a Subsidiary of Parent that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor that refinances Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the Issuer;

provided that such guarantee is incurred in accordance with the covenant described below under “—Future Guarantors”; (18) Indebtedness of Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries consisting of (a) the financing of insurance premiums, (b) take-or-pay obligations contained in supply arrangements, in each case incurred in the ordinary course of business and/or (c) obligations to reacquire assets or inventory in connection with customer financing arrangements in the ordinary course of business;

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of permitted Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock described in clauses (1) through (24) above or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, Parent, in its sole discretion, will classify or reclassify, or later divide, classify or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided that all Indebtedness outstanding under the North American Revolving Credit Agreement and the European Credit Agreement on the Issue Date shall be treated as incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the preceding paragraph. In addition, in the event an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant (other than clause (14) above) on the same date that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) is incurred or issued under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (14) above, then the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, or applicable leverage ratio, will be calculated with respect to such incurrence or issuance under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (14) above without regard to any incurrence or issuance under the second paragraph of this covenant (other than clause (14) above). Unless Parent elects otherwise, the incurrence or issuance of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) will be deemed incurred or issued first under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (14) to the extent permitted, with the balance incurred or issued under the second paragraph of this covenant (other than clause (14)). Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, and the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, of the same class, accretion or amortization of original issue discount or liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant. Any Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, to refinance Indebtedness incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, pursuant to clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), (12), (13) and (14) of the second paragraph above will be permitted to include additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock incurred to pay (I) any accrued and unpaid interest on the Indebtedness, any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock and any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Disqualified Stock being so refinanced, extended, replaced, refunded, renewed or defeased and (II) the amount of any tender premium or penalty or premium required to be paid under the terms of the instrument or documents governing such refinanced Indebtedness, Preferred Stock or -135 ----- Disqualified Stock and any defeasance costs and any fees and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) incurred in connection with the issuance of such new Indebtedness, Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the extension, replacement, refunding, refinancing, renewal or defeasance of such refinanced Indebtedness, Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock (and, with respect to Indebtedness under the North American Revolving Credit Facility, will be permitted to include an amount equal to any unutilized North American Revolving Credit Facility being refinanced, extended, replaced, refunded, renewed or defeased to the extent permanently terminated at the time of incurrence of such Refinancing Indebtedness). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. dollar equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness (plus premium (including tender premiums), fees, defeasance costs, accrued interest and expenses including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The principal amount of Indebtedness outstanding under any clause of this covenant will be determined after giving effect to the appreciation of proceeds of any such Indebtedness to refinance any other such Indebtedness. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) that is contractually subordinated or junior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, unless such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee to the extent and in the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral. _Liens_ Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer) to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien (except Permitted Liens) that secures obligations under any Indebtedness or any related guarantee, on any asset or property of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom. -136 ----- The expansion of Liens by virtue of accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, amortization of original issue discount and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Liens for purposes of this covenant. _Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets_ The Issuer and Parent may not consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer or Parent is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1) the Issuer or Parent is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Issuer or Parent, as applicable) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia (the Issuer, Parent or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”); (2) the Successor Company, if other than the Issuer or Parent, as applicable, expressly assumes all the obligations of the Issuer or Parent under the Notes, the Guarantee, the Indenture and the Security Documents pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other document or instrument; (3) immediately after such transaction, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and (4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction and any related financing transactions, as if such transactions had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either (a) Parent would be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction; (5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, in which case clause (2) of this paragraph shall apply, shall have by supplemental indenture or other document or instrument confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s obligations under the Indenture and the Notes; and (6) the Successor Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger winding up, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposal and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture and all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. The Successor Company (if other than Parent or the Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for Parent or the Issuer under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantee, as applicable, and in such event Parent or the Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligation under the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantee, as applicable. -137 ----- Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (1) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with or merge with or into or wind up into or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to the Parent or Issuer; (2) the Issuer or Parent may consolidate with or merge with or into or wind up into an Affiliate of the Parent solely for the purpose of redomiciling the Issuer or Parent, as applicable, in a state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof so long as the amount of Indebtedness of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby; (3) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be converted into, or reorganized or reconstituted as a limited liability company, limited partnership or corporation in a state of the United States, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof; and (4) the Issuer or Parent may change its name. Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture governing the release of a Guarantee upon the sale, disposition or transfer of a Subsidiary Guarantor, no Subsidiary Guarantor will, and Parent will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to, consolidate or merge with or into or wind up into (whether or not the Issuer or a Guarantor is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless: (1)(a) such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership or limited liability company organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Subsidiary Guarantor, as the case may be, or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, the District of Columbia or any territory thereof (such Subsidiary Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Person”); (b) the Successor Person, if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor, expressly assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture, such Subsidiary Guarantor’s related Guarantee and the Security Documents pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments; (c) immediately after such transaction, no Default exists; and (d) the Successor Person shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger winding up, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposal and such supplemental indentures, if any, comply with the Indenture and all conditions precedent provided for in the indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with; or (2) the transaction is made in compliance with clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.” Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Person (if other than such Subsidiary Guarantor) will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee, and such Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and such Subsidiary Guarantor’s Guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) any Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with or into or wind up into or sell, assign, -138 ----- transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to another Guarantor or to the Issuer, (2) a Subsidiary Guarantor may consolidate or merge with or into or wind up or convert into an Affiliate for the purpose of reincorporating such Subsidiary Guarantor in another state of a the United States or the District of Columbia, (3) a Subsidiary Guarantor may convert into a Person organized or existing under the laws of a jurisdiction in the United States, (4) a Subsidiary Guarantor may liquidate or dissolve or change its legal form if Parent determines in good faith that such action is in the best interests of Parent and is not materially disadvantageous to the Holders of the Notes or (5) a Guarantor may change its name. Clauses (2), (3), (4) and (5) of the first paragraph of this “—Merger, Consolidation and Sale of All or Substantially All Assets” covenant will not apply to a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all” under New York law, which governs the Indenture, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. _Transactions with Affiliates_ Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer) to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of Parent (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate _Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $5.0 million, unless:_ (1) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms, taken as a whole, that are not materially less favorable to Parent or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis or, if in the good faith judgment of the board of directors of Parent or a committee comprised solely of disinterested members of the board of directors of Parent, such Affiliate Transaction is fair to Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view; and (2) Parent delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of $25.0 million, a resolution adopted in good faith by the majority of the board of directors of Parent or a committee comprised solely of disinterested members of the board of directors of Parent approving such Affiliate Transaction and set forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above. The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following: (1) transactions between or among Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or an entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction, and any merger, consolidation or amalgamation of Parent and any direct or indirect parent of Parent; _provided that such parent shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than_ cash, Cash Equivalents and Capital Stock of Parent and such merger, consolidation or amalgamation is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and effected for a _bona fide business purpose;_ -139 ----- (2) Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described above under the covenant “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and Investments constituting Permitted Investments; (3) the payment of customary fees, reasonable out of pocket costs to and reimbursement of expenses and compensation paid to, and indemnities provided on behalf of or for the benefit of, future, present or former employees, officers, members of the board of directors (or similar governing body), members of management, managers, consultants or independent contractors (or the estate, heirs, family members, spouse, former spouse, domestic partner or former domestic partner of any of the foregoing) of Parent, in each case, in the ordinary course of business; (4) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Issue Date, or any amendment, modification or extension thereof (so long as any such amendment is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders when taken as a whole as compared to the applicable agreement as in effect on the Issue Date as determined in good faith by the board of directors of Parent or a committee comprised solely of disinterested members of the board of directors of Parent) or any transaction contemplated thereby; (5)(a) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers, joint ventures, contractors, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services or providers of employees or other labor, or transactions otherwise relating to the purchase or sale of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture which are fair to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in the good faith determination of the board of directors (or similar governing body) of Parent or a committee comprised solely of disinterested members of the board of directors of Parent, or the senior management of Parent, or are on terms at least as favorable as would reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party on an arm’s-length basis or (b) transactions with joint ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries entered into in the ordinary course of business or the terms of any such transactions are no less favorable to Parent or Restricted Subsidiary participating in such joint ventures than they are to other joint venture partners; (6) the sale, issuance or transfer of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock) of Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary to any person and the granting and performance of customary registration rights; (7) payments by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries made for any financial advisory, consulting, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities and other transaction fees, including, without limitation, in connection with acquisitions or divestitures which payments are approved by a majority of the board of directors of Parent or a committee comprised solely of disinterested members of the board of directors of Parent in good faith or are otherwise permitted by the Indenture; (8)(a) payments or loans (or cancellation of loans) or advances to employees, officers, directors, members of management, consultants or independent contractors (or the estate, heirs, family members, spouse, former spouse, domestic partner or former domestic partner of any of the foregoing) of Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and collective bargaining agreements, employment agreements, severance arrangements, compensatory (including profit sharing) arrangements, stock option plans, benefit plan, health, disability or similar insurance plan and other similar arrangements with such employees, officers, directors, managers, members of management, consultants or independent contractors (or the estate, heirs, family members, spouse, former spouse, domestic partner or former domestic partner of any of the foregoing) in each case, for bona fide business purposes and (b) any subscription agreement or similar agreement pertaining to the repurchase of Capital -140 ----- Stock pursuant to put/call rights or similar rights with future, present or former employees, officers, directors, members of management, consultants or independent contractors approved by the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary in good faith; (9) the payment of all expenses related to this offering of Notes incurred or owed after the Issue Date; (10) any contribution to the capital of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary; (11) between Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Person, a director of which is also a director of Parent or any direct or indirect parent of Parent; provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of Parent or such direct or indirect parent of Parent or of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person; (12) the issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, stock option and stock ownership plans or similar employee benefit plans approved by the board of directors (or equivalent governing body) of Parent or a committee comprised solely of disinterested members of the board of directors of Parent in good faith; (13) transactions undertaken in good faith (as certified by a responsible financial or accounting officer of Parent in an Officer’s Certificate) for the purposes of improving the consolidated tax efficiency of Parent and its Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing any covenant set forth in the Indenture so long as such transactions would not materially adversely affect the Holders;

and (20) investments by any Permitted Holder, Parent or any Affiliate thereof in securities or Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor. _Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries_ Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or Guarantors to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or allow to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any such Restricted Subsidiary to: (1)(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Issuer or any of the Guarantors on its Capital Stock or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits; or -141 ----- (b) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any of the Guarantors; (2) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any Guarantor; or (3) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any Guarantor, except (in each case) for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of: (a) contractual encumbrances or restrictions in effect on the Issue Date, including pursuant to the North American Revolving Credit Agreement and the European Credit Agreement and the related documentation; (b) the Indenture, the Notes and the related Guarantees; (c) purchase money obligations for property acquired and Capitalized Lease Obligations in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions of the nature discussed in clause (3) above on the property or assets so acquired;

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (1) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (2) the subordination of loans or advances made to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by Parent or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances. _Maintenance of Listing_ The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on TISE for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer determines that it will not maintain such listing, it will, prior to the delisting of the Notes from TISE (if then listed on TISE), use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of such Notes on another “recognised stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of the -143 ----- Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom (in which case, references in this covenant to TISE will be deemed to be refer to such other “recognised stock exchange”). In no event will this covenant require the Issuer to obtain or maintain the listing of the Notes on any exchange that requires financial reporting for any fiscal period in addition to the fiscal periods required by the SEC. _Future Guarantors_ Parent will not permit any of its domestic Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Restricted Subsidiaries (and non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries if such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary guarantees Indebtedness under the North American Revolving Credit Facility or Capital Markets Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor), other than the Issuer, a Guarantor or an Excluded Subsidiary, to guarantee the payment of (i) any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the Credit Facilities incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph described above under the caption “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” or (ii) any Capital Markets Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor having an aggregate principal amount outstanding in excess of $50.0 million, unless: (1) such Restricted Subsidiary within 30 days (i) executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary, except with respect to a Guarantee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor if such Indebtedness is by its express terms subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee, any such Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary with respect to such Indebtedness will be subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee substantially to the same extent as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or such Guarantor’s Guarantee and (ii) executes and delivers a supplement or joinder to the Security Documents or new Security Documents and takes all actions required thereunder to perfect the Liens created thereunder; and (2) such Restricted Subsidiary waives and will not in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation or any other applicable rights against Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of any payment by such Restricted Subsidiary under its Guarantee; _provided that this covenant will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary_ that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary and was not incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary. Parent may elect, in its sole discretion, to cause any Subsidiary that is not otherwise required to be a Guarantor to become a Guarantor, in which case such Subsidiary will not be required to comply with clause (1) or (2) above and such Guarantee may be released at any time in Parent’s sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each such Guarantee may be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. Each Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Guarantees.” -144 ----- _Reports and Other Information_ Whether or not Parent is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, so long as any Notes are outstanding, Parent will furnish to the Trustee: (1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year end of Parent, all financial information that would be required to be contained in an annual report on Form 10-K, or any successor or comparable form, filed with the SEC, including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and a report on the annual financial statements of Parent’s independent registered public accounting firm; (2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year of Parent, all financial information that would be required to be contained in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or any successor or comparable form, filed with the SEC; and (3) within ten Business Days after the occurrence of such an event, the information that would be required to be contained in filings with the SEC on Form 8-K under Items 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 2.01, 2.05, 2.06, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01 and 5.02(b), 5.02(c) and 5.02(d) (other than with respect to information required or contemplated by Item 402 of Regulation S-K) if Parent were required to file such reports; provided, however, that no such current report shall be required to be furnished if Parent determines in its good faith judgment that such event is not material to Holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided further that the foregoing shall not obligate Parent to make available copies of any agreements, financial statements or other items that would be required to be filed as exhibits to a current report on Form 8-K. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will not be required to furnish any information, certificates or reports required by (i) Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, (ii) Regulation G or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any non-generally accepted accounting principles financial measures contained therein or (iii) Rule 3-09 and 3-10 of Regulation S-X. If Parent is not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, Parent will deliver such information and such reports to any Holder of a Note and, upon request, to any beneficial owner of the Notes, in each case by posting such information on password-protected website which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, and will make such information readily available to any prospective investor in the Notes that certifies that it is an eligible purchaser of the Notes, any securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or any market maker in the Notes, in each case who (i) agrees to treat such information as confidential or (ii) accesses such information on such password-protected website which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment; provided that Parent shall post such information thereon and make readily available any password or other login information to any such prospective investor in the Notes, securities analyst (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) or market maker in the Notes. Parent will hold a quarterly conference call for all Holders and securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) to discuss such financial information within ten (10) Business Days after distribution of such financial information or otherwise providing substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by Parent in good faith) (it being understood that, without limitation, making such reports available on Bloomberg or another private electronic information service shall constitute substantially comparable availability); it being understood that any customary quarterly earnings calls with public equity holders shall be deemed to constitute such quarterly conference calls for all Holders and such securities analysts; provided, however, that if Parent is -145 ----- subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and has timely filed all applicable periodic reports required thereby, Parent will not be required to hold such a quarterly conference call so long as Parent makes one or more Officers available during normal business hours to answer any reasonable questions of Holders and security analysts in respect of such financial information. To the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, Parent will also furnish to Holders, securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) and prospective investors in the Notes upon request the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act, so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Securities Act. If Parent has designated any of its Subsidiaries as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and if any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary of Parent, then the annual and quarterly information required by clauses (1) and (2) of this covenant shall include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Parent will be deemed to have furnished the reports referred to in the first paragraph of this covenant if Parent has filed reports containing such information with the SEC. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor whether any such filings have been made. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including any default or the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on an Officer’s Certificate). _Further Assurances_ The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and the Guarantors will do or cause to be done all acts and things that may be required under applicable law or that the Collateral Agent from time to time may reasonably request, to assure and confirm that the Collateral Agent holds, for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, duly created and enforceable and perfected Liens upon the Notes Collateral (including any assets that are acquired or otherwise become, or are required by any Security Document to become, Notes Collateral after the Notes are issued), in each case, as contemplated by, and with the Lien priority required under, the Security Documents, and subject to the limitations set forth in the Security Documents. The Issuer and the Guarantors will promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver such security documents, instruments, certificates, notices and other documents, and take such other actions as will be reasonably required under applicable law or that the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in each case, to create, perfect or protect the Liens and benefits intended to be conferred, in each case as contemplated by the Security Documents for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, in each case, subject to the limitations set forth in the Security Documents. -146 ----- _Events of Default and Remedies_ The Indenture will provide that each of the following is an Event of Default: (1) default in payment when due and payable, upon redemption, acceleration or otherwise, of principal of, or premium, if any, on any Note; (2) default for 30 days or more in the payment when due of interest on or with respect to any Note; (3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply with the covenant described above under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets”; (4) failure by Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary for 60 days after receipt of written notice specifying the default given by the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 30% in principal amount of the Notes to comply with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clauses (1), (2) or (3) above) contained in the Indenture or the Notes; (5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there is issued or by which there is secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the payment of which is guaranteed by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, other than Indebtedness owed to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the issuance of any Note, if both: (a) such default either results from the failure to pay any principal of such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or relates to an obligation other than the obligation to pay principal of any such Indebtedness at its stated final maturity and results in the holder or holders of such Indebtedness causing such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity; and (b) the principal amount of such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such indebtedness in default for failure to pay any principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregate $50.0 million or more at any one time outstanding; (6) failure by Parent or any Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Parent), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $50.0 million (net of any amounts paid or fully covered by independent third party insurance as to which the relevant insurance company does not dispute coverage), which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged, unwaived and unstayed for a period of more than 60 days after such judgment becomes final and non-appealable, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree which is not promptly stayed; (7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to Parent or any Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Parent), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary; (8) the Guarantee of Parent or any Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Parent), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, shall for any reason cease to be in full force and effect or any responsible officer of Parent or any Guarantor that is a Significant -147 ----- Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Parent), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, as the case may be, denies that it has any further liability under its or their Guarantee(s) or gives notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture; or (9) so long as the Security Documents have not otherwise been terminated in accordance with their terms or the Notes Collateral as a whole of the Issuer or any Guarantor has not otherwise been released from the Lien of the Security Documents in accordance with the terms thereof, (a) the Liens with respect to a material portion of the Notes Collateral cease to be valid or enforceable, (b) default by the Issuer or any such Guarantor for 60 days after written notice given by the Trustee or Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes in the performance of any covenant under the Security Documents which adversely affects the enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Lien on the Notes Collateral securing the Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes or which adversely affects the condition or value of the Notes Collateral, in each case, taken as a whole, in any material respect, (c) repudiation or disaffirmation by the Issuer or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of the Parent, of any of its material obligations under the Security Documents or (d) the determination in a judicial proceeding that all or any material portion of the Security Documents, taken as a whole, are unenforceable or invalid, for any reason, against the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to any material portion of the Notes Collateral. If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (7) above with respect to Parent or any Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Parent), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing under the Indenture, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the then total outstanding Notes by notice to Parent and the Paying Agent (and if given by the Holders, with a copy to the Trustee) may declare the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Note to be due and payable immediately. Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (7) above with respect to Parent or any Significant Subsidiary, or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for Parent), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Indenture provides that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of the Notes waive any existing Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default in the payment of interest on, premium, if any, or the principal of any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (5) above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof (excluding any resulting payment default, other than as a result of acceleration of the Notes) shall be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the Holders, if within 30 days after such Event of Default arose: (1) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged; or -148 ----- (2) Holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default; or (3) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has been cured. The Indenture will provide that, at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the Notes, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes may rescind and cancel such declaration and its consequences: (1) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree; (2) if all existing Events of Default have been cured, waived, annulled or rescinded except nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration; (3) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest and overdue principal, which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid; and (4) if the Issuer or Parent has paid the Trustee and the Paying Agent its reasonable compensation and reimbursed the Trustee and the Paying Agent for its expenses, disbursements and advances. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless the Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee, in writing, to pursue the remedy; (3) Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt thereof and the offer of security or indemnity; and (5) Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, under the Indenture the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder of a Note or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Indenture will provide that Parent is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and Parent is required, within five Business Days, after becoming aware of any Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default. -149 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

The obligation to make such payments may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to contingent payment debt instruments, or CPDIs. Under applicable Treasury regulations, the possibility of such excess amounts being paid will not cause the Notes to be treated as CPDIs if either (i) such amounts would be paid pursuant to an option of the Issuers that would cause the yield on the debt instrument to increase or (ii) as of the issue date of the Notes, there is only a remote chance that these contingencies will occur or if such contingencies are considered to be “incidental.” Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such payments does not result in the Notes being treated as CPDIs under applicable Treasury regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance of the Notes, (i) the contingency described under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption” relates to an option of ours that would cause the yield on the debt instrument to increase and (ii) the contingencies described under “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” and “Description of Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts” are remote or incidental within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations. -192 ----- Our determination that the Notes should not be treated as CPDIs is binding on a holder, unless such holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a position contrary to that described above, the Notes may be treated as CPDIs. In that case, regardless of a holder’s method of tax accounting, such holder may be required to accrue interest income on the Notes in excess of the stated interest. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes may be recharacterized as ordinary income rather than capital gain, and other tax consequences of the ownership and the disposition of the Notes could be materially and adversely different from those described herein. Holders of Notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as CPDIs. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as CPDIs.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289
429,Offerings 2017.md,327,CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,327.2,Tax Consequences of Ownership of the Notes to U.S. Holders,327.2.1,,"Interest on the Notes._ Interest on the Notes will generally be taxable to a U.S. Holder as United States source ordinary income at the time the holder receives or accrues such amounts in accordance with the holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes. The interest on the Notes will be paid in euros rather than in United States dollars. In general, a U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes and who receives a payment of stated interest in Euro (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of a Note) will be required to include in income the United States dollar value of the Euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to United States dollars at that time. A cash-basis U.S. Holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the Euro received. A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes is generally required to accrue Euro-denominated stated interest income in Euro and translate that amount into United States dollars based on the average rate of exchange in effect for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate of exchange for the partial period within the applicable taxable year. For this purpose, the average rate is the simple average of spot rates of exchange for each business day of such period or other average exchange rate for the period reasonably derived and consistently applied by the U.S. Holder. Alternatively, an accrual-method U.S. Holder may elect to translate stated interest income received in Euro into United States dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period (or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the last day of such partial accrual period) or, if the date of receipt is within five business days of the last day of the interest accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder that makes this election must apply it consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot change the election without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued Euro-denominated stated interest income on the date the interest payment (or proceeds from a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest) is actually received. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss -193 ----- recognized will be equal to the difference between the United States dollar value of the Euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received) in respect of the accrual period and the United States dollar value of stated interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to United States dollars. In general, this foreign currency gain or loss will be treated, for United States foreign tax credit purposes, as United States-source ordinary income or loss, and will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Moreover, if Additional Amounts are required to be paid to a U.S. Holder in connection with the withholding or deduction of taxes imposed on payments on the Notes (see “Description of Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts”), such Additional Amounts generally will be included in the U.S. Holder’s gross income as additional interest at the time such Additional Amounts are paid or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting. As a result, the amount of interest income included in gross income for United States federal income tax purposes by a U.S. Holder with respect to a payment of interest may be greater than the amount of cash actually received by the U.S. Holder with respect to such payment. If such taxes are nonUnited States withholding taxes, subject to applicable limitations, a U.S. Holder generally may be entitled to claim either a credit against its United States federal income tax liability or a deduction in computing its United States federal taxable income in respect of foreign taxes withheld from payments on the Notes. Because the interest payments generally will be treated as United States source, the use of United States foreign tax credits relating to any non-United States tax imposed upon interest payments may be limited. The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances. Sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes._ In general, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note will result in United States source capital gain or loss to a U.S. Holder in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition (not including the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on the Note, which amount will be treated as ordinary interest income to the extent not previously included in the U.S. Holder’s income) and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note immediately before the disposition. If a U.S. Holder receives Euro on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the United States dollar value of Euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date payment is received or the Note is disposed of. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash-basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual-basis U.S. Holder, will determine the United States dollar value of Euro by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual-basis U.S. Holders in regard to the disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If an accrual-basis U.S. Holder does not make the special settlement date election, such U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute United States-source ordinary income or loss. A holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be the United States dollar value of the Euro paid for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase (which generally should be the closing date), decreased by any principal payments received by such holder, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received. The gain or loss realized at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition will be long-term capital gain or loss (excluding any amount attributable to -194 ----- accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income to the extent the U.S. Holder has not previously included the accrued interest in income) if the Note was held for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition. Certain non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation on long-term capital gain under certain circumstances. Long-term capital gains of corporations are not subject to reduced United States federal income tax rates and are subject to United States federal income tax at the same rate as the corporation’s ordinary income. The ability to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the deductibility of capital losses in their particular circumstances. Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss not treated as interest income or expense. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will be equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the United States dollar value of the purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note is disposed of, and (ii) the United States dollar value of the purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note was acquired. Payments received that are attributable to accrued interest will be treated in accordance with the rules applicable to payments of interest described above. Any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued interest) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the redemption, sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of the Note. Generally, the foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be United States-source ordinary income or loss for United States foreign tax credit purposes. Reportable transactions._ Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under the Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note or Euros received in respect of a Note to the extent that such sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement). Net investment income._ Certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts may be required to pay an additional 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on certain “net investment income” in excess of certain thresholds. Among other items, “net investment income” generally includes gross income from interest and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain investments (less certain deductions), unless such interest income and net gain is derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). In the case of a U.S. Holder that is an individual, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (1) such individual’s net investment income or (2) the amount by which the individual’s modified adjusted gross income (defined as adjusted gross income plus certain net foreign income generally excluded from taxable income under the Code) exceeds $250,000 (if the individual is married and filing jointly or a surviving spouse), $125,000 (if the individual is married and filing separately) or $200,000 (in any other case). In the case of an estate or trust, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (1) undistributed net investment income and (2) the excess adjusted gross income over the dollar amount at which the highest income tax bracket applicable to an estate or trust begins. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors concerning -195 ----- the implications of this Medicare contribution tax on their ownership and disposition of the Notes, based on their particular circumstances. Backup withholding and information reporting._ Under the backup withholding rules, payments of principal and interest on a Note and payments of proceeds from the disposition of a Note may be subject to backup withholding at the applicable tax rate (currently 28%) unless the U.S. Holder timely (i) establishes that it is an exempt recipient, such as a corporation or (ii) provides a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that it is a U.S. person and that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred, and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules should generally be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s United States federal income tax liability and, if backup withholding results in an overpayment of United States federal income tax, such U.S. Holder may be entitled to a refund, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain penalties may be imposed by the IRS on a recipient of payments that is required to supply information but that does not do so in the proper manner. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption. In addition, such payments to U.S. Holders that are not exempt recipients will generally be subject to information reporting requirements. When required, information will be reported to both U.S. Holders and the IRS regarding the amount of interest and principal paid on the Notes in each calendar year as well as the corresponding amount of tax withheld, if any. This obligation, however, does not apply with respect to payments to certain U.S. Holders, including corporations and tax-exempt organizations, provided that they establish entitlement to an exemption.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

However, interest may be required to be reported annually on IRS Form 1042-S.

The acquisition and/or holding of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuers, the initial purchaser, or the subsidiary guarantors are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA)) of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289
429,Offerings 2017.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.3,Representation,107.3.1,,"Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note, each purchaser and subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted, that either (i) no portion of the assets used by such purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Notes constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws, and if it is an ERISA Plan, the decision to acquire and hold the Notes has been made by a Plan Fiduciary who is independent of the Transaction Parties, which Plan Fiduciary (A) is a fiduciary under ERISA or the Code, or both, with respect to the decision to acquire and hold the Notes, (B) is not an IRA owner (in the case of an IRA), (C) is capable of evaluating investment risks independently, both in general and with regard to the prospective investment in the Notes, (D) has exercised independent judgment in evaluating whether to invest the assets of such ERISA Plan in the Notes, and (E) is either a bank, an insurance carrier, a registered investment adviser, a registered broker-dealer or an independent fiduciary with at least $50 million of assets under management or control as specified in 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-21(c)(1)(i). The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in -200 ----- non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA. The sale of the Notes to a Plan, or to a person using assets of any Plan to effect its acquisition or holding of the Notes, is in no respect a representation by the Issuer or the initial purchaser that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by Plans generally or any particular Plan, or that such an investment is appropriate for the Plans generally or any particular Plan. -201 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

429,Offerings 2017.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.1,,25.1.1,,"Subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement, the initial purchaser has agreed to purchase from us the entire principal amount of the Notes at the initial offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum less discounts and commissions. The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchaser to purchase the Notes are subject to certain conditions precedent and that the initial purchaser will purchase all of the Notes offered by this offering memorandum if any of the Notes are purchased. The initial purchaser proposes to offer the Notes initially at the offering price on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the initial purchaser may change the offering price and other selling terms. Sales of the Notes in the United States may be made through an affiliate of the initial purchaser. The initial purchaser may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the Notes in jurisdictions in which the initial purchaser is not otherwise permitted to make sales. We have agreed to indemnify the initial purchaser against some specified types of liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments the initial purchaser may be required to make in respect of any of these liabilities. The Notes and the related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act. The initial purchaser has agreed that it will offer or sell the Notes only (i) in the United States to persons it reasonably believes to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act or (ii) in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes being offered and sold pursuant to Regulation S may not be offered, sold or delivered in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. person, unless an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A under the Securities Act. See “Notice to Investors.” In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until the expiration of forty (40) days after the commencement of the offering, any offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a broker-dealer may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act, unless such offer or sale is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act or another available exemption from the registration requirements thereof. We have agreed that, during the period beginning on the date of this offering memorandum and continuing to the date that is 60 days after the Notes are issued, without the prior written consent of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, we will not offer, sell or contract to sell, or otherwise dispose of, except as provided in the purchase agreement, any securities of the Issuer (or guaranteed by the Issuer) that are substantially similar to the Notes. The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. We do not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system, except that application will be made to list the Notes on TISE. We can provide no assurance that this application will be accepted. The initial purchaser may make a market in the Notes after completion of the offering, but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Notes or that an active public market for the Notes will develop. If an active public trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. In connection with the offering, the initial -202 ----- purchaser may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, purchases to cover positions created by short sales and stabilizing transactions. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchaser of a greater principal amount of Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The initial purchaser may close out any short position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the initial purchaser is concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of the Notes made by the initial purchaser in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions may have the effect of preventing or slowing a decline in the market price of the Notes. Additionally, these purchases, along with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. We expect to deliver the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this offering memorandum, which will be the fifth business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T + 5”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle T + 5, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of trade to prevent a failed settlement. Investors who wish to trade the Notes prior to the delivery date should consult their own advisors. The initial purchaser and its affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. The initial purchaser and its affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. An affiliate of the initial purchaser acts as a lender and agent under the European Credit Facility and will receive customary compensation in connection therewith. The initial purchaser will receive customary commissions and discounts under the purchase agreement upon the consummation of the offering of the Notes pursuant to this offering memorandum. An affiliate of the initial purchaser is a lender under the Term Loan Facility, and therefore may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the initial purchaser and its affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the initial purchaser or its affiliates have a lending relationship with us, the initial purchaser or its affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of the initial purchaser or its affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchaser and its affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of -203 ----- either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The initial purchaser and its affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. -204 -----",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

429,Offerings 2017.md,334,LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY,334.5,"KRONOS WORLDWIDE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2016 Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:",334.5.1,,"_Organization and basis of presentation—At December 31, 2016, Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI) held_ approximately 50% of our outstanding common stock and a wholly-owned subsidiary of NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL) held approximately 30% of our common stock. Valhi owned approximately 83% of NL’s outstanding common stock and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran Corporation held approximately 93% of Valhi’s outstanding common stock. All of Contran’s outstanding voting stock is held by a family trust established for the benefit of Lisa K. Simmons and Serena Simmons Connelly and their children, for which Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly are co-trustees, or is held directly by Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly or entities related to them. Consequently, Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly may be deemed to control Contran, Valhi, NL and us. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this report to “we,” “us” or “our” refers to Kronos Worldwide, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. _Management’s estimates–In preparing our financial statements in conformity with_ accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ significantly from previously-estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions. _Principles of consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and_ those of our majority-owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all material intercompany accounts and balances. _Translation of currencies—We translate the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries whose_ functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar at year-end exchange rates, while we translate our revenues and expenses at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. We accumulate the resulting translation adjustments in stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related deferred income taxes. We recognize currency transaction gains and losses in income currently. _Derivatives and hedging activities—We recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities_ measured at fair value. We recognize the effect of changes in the fair value of derivatives either in net income or other comprehensive income (loss), depending on the intended use of the derivative. See Note 18. _Cash and cash equivalents—We classify bank time deposits and U.S. Treasury securities_ purchased under short-term agreements to resell with original maturities of three months or less as cash equivalents. _Restricted cash—We classify cash that has been segregated or is otherwise limited in use as_ restricted. Such restrictions or limitations relate to certain Norwegian payroll tax and unfunded employee benefit obligations. To the extent the restricted amount relates to a recognized FA-7 ----- liability, we classify such restricted amount as either a current or noncurrent asset to correspond with the classification of the liability. To the extent the restricted amount does not relate to a recognized liability, we classify restricted cash as a current asset. All of our restricted cash is classified as a current asset and is separately presented on the face of the statement of financial position. _Marketable securities and securities transactions—We carry marketable securities at fair_ value. Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and _Disclosures, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and (with certain_ exceptions) this framework is generally applied to all financial statement items required to be measured at fair value. The standard requires fair value measurements to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: - Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; - Level 2—Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liability; and - Level 3—Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. We classify all of our marketable securities as available-for-sale and unrealized gains or losses on these securities are recognized through other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes, except for any decline in value we conclude is other than temporary, which is accounted for as a realized loss as a component of net income. We base realized gains and losses upon the specific identification of the securities sold. We evaluate our investments whenever events or conditions occur to indicate that the fair value of such investments has declined below their carrying amounts. If the carrying amount for an investment declines below its historical cost basis, we evaluate all available positive and negative evidence including, but not limited to, the extent and duration of the impairment, business prospects for the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of fair value. If we determine the decline in fair value is other than temporary, the carrying amount of the investment is written down to fair value. See Notes 6, 10 and 18. _Accounts receivable—We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for known and_ estimated potential losses arising from sales to customers based on a periodic review of these accounts. See Note 3. _Inventories and cost of sales—We state inventories at the lower of cost or market, net of_ allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories. We generally base inventory costs for all inventory categories on average cost that approximates the first-in, first-out method. Inventories include the costs for raw materials, the cost to manufacture the raw materials into finished goods and overhead. Depending on the inventory’s stage of completion, our manufacturing costs can include the costs of packing and finishing, utilities, maintenance, depreciation, and salaries and benefits associated with our manufacturing process. We allocate fixed manufacturing overheads based on normal production capacity. Unallocated overhead costs resulting from periods with abnormally low production levels are charged to expense as incurred. As inventory is sold to third parties, we recognize the cost of sales in the same period FA-8 ----- that the sale occurs. We periodically review our inventory for estimated obsolescence or instances when inventory is no longer marketable for its intended use, and we record any writedown equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about alternative uses, market conditions and other factors. See Note 4. _Investment in TiO2 manufacturing joint venture— We account for our investment in a_ 50%-owned manufacturing joint venture by the equity method. Distributions received from such investee are classified for statement of cash flow purposes using the “nature of distribution” approach under ASC Topic 320. See Note 5. _Property and equipment and depreciation—We state property and equipment at cost,_ including capitalized interest on borrowings during the actual construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest costs were $2.9 million in 2014, $1.1 million in 2015 and $.9 million in 2016. We compute depreciation of property and equipment for financial reporting purposes (including mining equipment) principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2017,289
429,Offerings 2017.md,334,LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY,334.6,Asset** **Useful lives,334.6.1,,"Buildings and improvements 10 to 40 years Machinery and equipment 3 to 20 years Mine development costs units-of-production We use accelerated depreciation methods for income tax purposes, as permitted. Upon the sale or retirement of an asset, we remove the related cost and accumulated depreciation from the accounts and recognize any gain or loss in income currently. We expense costs incurred for maintenance, repairs and minor renewals (including planned major maintenance) while we capitalize expenditures for major improvements. We have a governmental concession with an unlimited term to operate our ilmenite mines in Norway. Mining properties consist of buildings and equipment used in our Norwegian ilmenite mining operations. While we own the land and ilmenite reserves associated with the mining operations, such land and reserves were acquired for nominal value and we have no material asset recognized for the land and reserves related to our mining operations. We perform impairment tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We consider all relevant factors. We perform the impairment test by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows (exclusive of interest expense) associated with the asset to the asset’s net carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value or discounted cash flow value is required. _Long-term debt—We state long-term debt net of any unamortized original issue premium,_ discount or deferred financing costs (other than deferred financing costs associated with revolving credit facilities, which are recognized as an asset). We classify amortization of all deferred financing costs and any premium or discount associated with the issuance of indebtedness as interest expense and compute such amortization by either the interest method or the straight-line method over the term of the applicable issue. See Note 8. _Employee benefit plans—Accounting and funding policies for our retirement plans are_ described in Note 10. FA-9 ----- _Income taxes—We, Valhi and our qualifying subsidiaries are members of Contran’s_ consolidated U.S. federal income tax group (the Contran Tax Group) and we and certain of our qualifying subsidiaries also file consolidated income tax returns with Contran in various U.S. state jurisdictions. As a member of the Contran Tax Group, we are jointly and severally liable for the federal income tax liability of Contran and the other companies included in the Contran Tax Group for all periods in which we are included in the Contran Tax Group. See Note 17. As a member of the Contran Tax Group, we are a party to a tax sharing agreement which provides that we compute our provision for U.S. income taxes on a separate-company basis using the tax elections made by Contran. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, we make payments to or receive payments from Valhi in amounts we would have paid to or received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or the applicable state tax authority had we not been a member of the Contran Tax Group. We made net payments of income taxes to Valhi of $8.2 million in 2014 and $.8 million in 2016, and received net income tax refunds from Valhi of $3.5 million in 2015. We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, including investments in our subsidiaries and affiliates who are not members of the Contran Tax Group and undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries which are not deemed to be permanently reinvested. The earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries subject to permanent reinvestment plans aggregated $660 million at December 31, 2016. It is not practical for us to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to such earnings due to the complexities associated with the U.S. taxation on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries repatriated to the U.S. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities for each tax-paying jurisdiction in which we operate are netted and presented as either a noncurrent deferred income tax asset or liability, as applicable. We periodically evaluate our deferred tax assets in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and adjust any related valuation allowance based on the estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that we believe does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria. We record a reserve for uncertain tax positions for tax positions where we believe that it is more-likely-than-not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities. The amount of the benefit associated with our uncertain tax positions that we recognize is limited to the largest amount for which we believe the likelihood of realization is greater than 50%. We accrue penalties and interest on the difference between tax positions taken on our tax returns and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes. We classify our reserves for uncertain tax positions in a separate current or noncurrent liability, depending on the nature of the tax position. See Note 14. _Net sales—We record sales when products are shipped and title and other risks and_ rewards of ownership have passed to the customer. Shipping terms of products shipped are generally FOB shipping point, although in some instances shipping terms are FOB destination point (for which we do not recognize sales until the product is received by the customer) or other standard shipping terms. We state sales net of price, early payment and distributor discounts and volume rebates. We report any tax assessed by a governmental authority that we collect from our customers that is both imposed on and concurrent with our revenue-producing activities (such as sales, use, value added and excise taxes) on a net basis (meaning we do not recognize these taxes either in our revenues or in our costs and expenses). _Selling, general and administrative expense; shipping and handling costs—Selling, general_ and administrative expense includes costs related to marketing, sales, distribution, shipping and handling, research and development, legal, and administrative functions such as accounting, treasury and finance, and includes costs for salaries and benefits not associated with our FA-10 ----- manufacturing process, travel and entertainment, promotional materials and professional fees. We include shipping and handling costs in selling, general and administrative expense and these costs were $95 million in 2014, $87 million in 2015 and $90 million in 2016. We expense research, development and certain sales technical support costs as incurred and these costs approximated $19 million in 2014, $16 million in 2015 and $13 million in 2016. We expense advertising costs as incurred and these costs were not material in any year presented.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

LPC is a manufacturing joint venture whose other 50%-owner is Huntsman P&A Investments LLC (HPA) (formerly Tioxide Americas LLC). HPA is a subsidiary of Huntsman Corporation. LPC owns and operates a chloride-process TiO2 plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana. We and HPA are both required to purchase one-half of the TiO2 produced by LPC, unless we and HPA agree otherwise (such as in 2015, when we purchased approximately 52% of the production from the plant). LPC operates on a break-even basis and, accordingly, we report no equity in earnings of LPC. Each owner’s acquisition transfer price for its share of the TiO2 produced is equal to its share of the joint venture’s production costs and interest expense, if any. Our share of net cost is reported as cost of sales as the related TiO2 acquired from LPC is sold. We report distributions we receive from LPC, which generally relate to excess cash generated by LPC from its non-cash production costs, and contributions we make to LPC, which generally relate to cash required by LPC when it builds working capital, as part of our cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Consequently, Ms. Simmons and Ms. Connelly may be deemed to control Contran, Valhi, NL and us. _Basis of presentation—The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements_ contained in this Quarterly Report have been prepared on the same basis as the audited Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 10, 2017 (2016 Annual Report). In our opinion, we have made all necessary adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments, other than the reversal of the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance recognized in the second quarter of 2017, as discussed in Note 11) in order to state fairly, in all material respects, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented. We have condensed the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 contained in this Quarterly Report as compared to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements at that date, and we have omitted certain information and footnote disclosures (including those related to the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016) normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our results of operations for the interim periods ended June 30, 2017 may not be indicative of our operating results for the full year.

FB-7 ----- Interest rate swap contract . . . . . . . $(2.8) $ — $(2.8) $— Noncurrent marketable securities (See Note 4) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.2 5.2 — — Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our risk management policy allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage exposure to currency exchange rates and interest rates. Derivatives that we use are primarily currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. We have not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past, nor do we currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future. _Currency forward contracts—Certain of our sales generated by our non-U.S. operations are_ denominated in U.S. dollars. We periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with trade receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder’s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales. Derivatives used to hedge forecasted transactions and specific cash flows associated with financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges. Consequently, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Contracts that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are markedto-market at each balance sheet date with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently as part of net currency transaction gains and losses. The fair value of the currency forward contracts is determined using Level 1 inputs based on the currency spot forward rates quoted by banks or currency dealers. At December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017, we had no currency forward contracts outstanding. We did not use hedge accounting for any of our contracts to the extent we held such contracts in 2016. _Interest rate swap contract—As part of our interest rate risk management strategy, in_ August 2015 we entered into a pay- fixed/receive-variable interest rate swap contract with Wells FB-15 ----- Fargo Bank, N.A. to minimize our exposure to volatility in LIBOR as it relates to our forecasted outstanding variable-rate indebtedness. Under this interest rate swap, we will pay a fixed rate of 2.016% per annum, payable quarterly, and receive a variable rate of three-month LIBOR (subject to a 1.00% floor), also payable quarterly, in each case based on the notional amount of the swap then outstanding. The effective date of the swap contract was September 30, 2015. The notional amount of the swap started at $344.8 million and declines by $875,000 each quarter beginning December 31, 2015, with a final maturity of the swap contract in February 2020. The notional amount of the swap as of June 30, 2017 was $338.6 million. This swap contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge and qualified as an effective hedge at inception under ASC Topic 815. The effective portion of changes in fair value on this interest rate swap is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015, as interest expense accrues on LIBOR-based variable rate debt, we classify the amount we pay under the pay-fixed leg of the swap and the amount we receive under the receive-variable leg of the swap as part of interest expense, with the net effect that the amount of interest expense we recognize on our LIBOR-based variable rate debt each quarter, as it relates to the notional amount of the swap outstanding each quarter, to be based on a fixed rate of 2.016% per annum in lieu of the level of LIBOR prevailing during the quarter. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness, if any, related to the swap will be recorded in earnings (also as part of interest expense). Since the inception of the swap through June 30, 2017, there have been no gains or losses recognized in earnings representing hedge ineffectiveness with respect to the interest rate swap. During the first six months of June 30, 2017, the pretax unrealized loss arising during the period and recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swap contract was $1.4 million. During the same period, $1.6 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings (interest expense). During the next twelve months, the amount of the June 30, 2017 accumulated other comprehensive loss balance that is expected to be reclassified to interest expense is $2.4 million pre-tax. The fair value of the interest rate swap contract at June 30, 2017 was a $2.8 million liability including $2.0 million recognized as part of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $.8 million recognized as part of other noncurrent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Notes 7 and 8. The fair value of the interest rate swap was estimated by a third party using inputs that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves, and therefore, is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The following table presents the financial instruments that are not carried at fair value but which require fair value disclosure as of December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

At June 30, 2017, we had approximately $91.4 million available for additional borrowing under this revolving credit facility. _European revolving credit facility—Our European revolving credit facility requires the_ maintenance of certain financial ratios, and one of such requirements is based on the ratio of net debt to last twelve months earnings before income tax, interest, depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA) of the borrowers.

The amount shown on such table for incremental net tax expense (benefit) on earnings and losses on non-U.S. companies includes, as applicable, (i) current income taxes (including withholding taxes, if applicable), if any, associated with any current-year earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such current-year earnings were distributed to us in the current year, (ii) deferred income taxes (or deferred income tax benefit) associated with the current-year change in the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of our Canadian subsidiary, which earnings are not subject to a permanent reinvestment plan, in an amount representing the current-year change in the aggregate current income tax that would be generated (including withholding taxes, if applicable) when such aggregate undistributed earnings are distributed to us, and (iii) current U.S. income taxes (or current income tax benefit), including U.S. personal holding company tax, as applicable, attributable to current-year income (losses) of one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which subsidiary is treated as a dual resident for U.S. income tax purposes, to the extent the current-year income (losses) of such subsidiary is subject to U.S. income tax under the U.S. dual-resident provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. We have substantial net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in Germany (the equivalent of $638 million for German corporate purposes and $71 million for German trade tax purposes at December 31, 2016) and in Belgium (the equivalent of $93 million for Belgian corporate tax purposes at December 31, 2016), all of which have an indefinite carryforward period. As a result, we have net deferred income tax assets with respect to these two jurisdictions, primarily related to these NOL carryforwards. The German corporate tax is similar to the U.S. federal income tax, and the German trade tax is similar to the U.S. state income tax. Prior to June 30, 2015, and using all available evidence, we had concluded no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was required to be recognized with respect to these net deferred income tax assets under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria, primarily because (i) the carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, (ii) we utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three-year period, and (iii) we expected to utilize the remainder of the carryforwards over the long term. We had also previously indicated that facts and circumstances could change, which might in the future result in the recognition of a valuation allowance against some or all of such deferred income tax assets. However, as of June 30, 2015, and given our operating results during the second quarter of 2015 and our expectations at that time for our operating results for the remainder of 2015, we did not have sufficient positive evidence to overcome the significant negative evidence of having cumulative losses in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters in both our German and Belgian jurisdictions at June 30, 2015 (even considering that the carryforward period of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards is indefinite, one piece of positive evidence). Accordingly, at June 30, 2015, we concluded that we were required to recognize a non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria with respect to our German and Belgian net deferred income tax assets at such date. We recognized an additional non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance during the second half of 2015 due to losses recognized by our German and Belgian operations during such period. During 2016, we recognized an aggregate $2.2 million non-cash tax benefit as the result of a net decrease in such deferred income tax valuation allowance, as the impact of utilizing a portion of our German NOLs during such period more than offset the impact of additional losses recognized by our Belgian operations during such period. Such valuation allowance aggregated approximately $173 million at December 31, 2016 ($153 million with respect to Germany and $20 million with respect to Belgium). During the first six months of 2017, we recognized an aggregate non-cash income tax benefit of $12.7 million as a result of a net decrease in such deferred income tax asset valuation allowance, due to utilizing a portion of both the German and Belgian NOLs during such period, including $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2017. At June 30, 2017, we concluded we now have sufficient positive FB-11 ----- evidence under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria to support reversal of the entire valuation allowance related to our German and Belgian operations. As discussed below, a large portion of the remaining valuation allowance is reversed as of June 30, 2017, but a portion of the remaining valuation allowance will be reversed during the second half of 2017. Such sufficient positive evidence at June 30, 2017 includes, among other things, the existence of cumulative profits in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters (Germany) or profitability in recent quarters during which such profitability was trending upward throughout such period (Belgium), the ability to demonstrate future profitability in Germany and Belgium for a sustainable period, and the indefinite carryforward period for the German and Belgian NOLs. Accordingly, our income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2017 includes an aggregate noncash income tax benefit of $149.9 million related to such reversal at June 30, 2017 ($141.9 million related to Germany, and $8.0 million related to Belgium). Such second quarter 2017 income tax benefit associated with reversal of the German and Belgian valuation allowance excludes the non-cash income tax benefit of $7.7 million, also recognized in the second quarter, as discussed above. In addition to the above amounts, our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance increased by $9.5 million during the first six months of 2017 as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, which was recognized as part of other comprehensive income (loss). In accordance with the ASC 740-270 guidance regarding accounting for income taxes at interim dates, the amount of the valuation allowance reversed at June 30, 2017 ($149.9 million) relates to our change in judgment regarding the realizability of the related deferred income tax asset as it relates to future years (i.e. 2018 and after). A change in judgment regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets as it relates to the current year is considered in determining the estimated annual effective tax rate for the year. Accordingly, of the aggregate $173 million deferred income tax asset valuation allowance recognized at December 31, 2016, approximately $163 million has been reversed through June 30, 2017, and the remaining $20 million (which relates to the expected level of profitability of our German and Belgian operations in calendar 2017) will be reversed during the third and fourth quarters of 2017 (such aggregate reversal amount includes the $9.5 million increase to our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance as a result of changes in currency exchange rates recognized as part of other comprehensive income (loss)). Tax authorities are examining certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. tax returns and have or may propose tax deficiencies, including penalties and interest. Because of the inherent uncertainties involved in settlement initiatives and court and tax proceedings, we cannot guarantee that these matters will be resolved in our favor, and therefore our potential exposure, if any, is also uncertain. As a result of ongoing audits in certain jurisdictions, in 2008 we filed Advance Pricing Agreement Requests with the tax authorities in the U.S., Canada and Germany. These requests have been under review with the respective tax authorities since 2008 and prior to 2016, it was uncertain whether an agreement would be reached between the tax authorities and whether we would agree to execute and finalize such agreements. During 2016, Contran, as the ultimate parent of our U.S. Consolidated income tax group, executed and finalized an Advance Pricing Agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and our Canadian subsidiary executed and finalized an Advance Pricing Agreement with the Competent Authority for Canada (collectively, the “U.S.-Canada APA”) effective for tax years 2005—2015. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S.Canada APA, the U.S. and Canadian tax authorities agreed to certain prior year changes to taxable income of our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. As a result of such agreed-upon changes, our Canadian subsidiary incurred a cash income tax payment of approximately CAD $3 million (USD $2.3 million) related to the U.S.-Canada APA, but such payment was fully offset by previously provided accruals. We currently expect the Advance Pricing Agreement between Canada and Germany (collectively, the “Canada-Germany APA”) to be executed and finalized within the next twelve months. We believe we have adequate accruals to cover any cash income FB-12 ----- tax payment which might result from the finalization of the Canada-Germany APA, and accordingly we do not expect the execution of such APA to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We believe we have adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which could ultimately result from tax examinations. We believe the ultimate disposition of tax examinations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We currently estimate that our unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $7.0 million excluding accrued interest during the next twelve months related to certain adjustments to our prior year returns.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

At least quarterly our management discusses and evaluates the status of any pending litigation to which we are a party. The factors considered in such evaluation include, among other things, the nature of such pending cases, the status of such pending cases, the advice of legal counsel and our experience in similar cases (if any). Based on such evaluation, we make a determination as to whether we believe (i) it is probable a loss has been incurred, and if so if the amount of such loss (or a range of loss) is reasonably estimable, or (ii) it is reasonably possible but not probable a loss has been incurred, and if so if the amount of such loss (or a range of loss) is reasonably estimable, or (iii) the probability a loss has been incurred is remote. We have not accrued any material amounts for either of the two pending matters discussed below, as it is not reasonably possible we have incurred a loss that would be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

The complaint alleges that the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price at which titanium dioxide was sold in the United States and engaged in other anticompetitive conduct. The case is now proceeding in the trial court. We believe the action is without merit, will deny all allegations of wrongdoing and liability and intend to defend against the action vigorously. Based on our quarterly status evaluation of this case, we have determined that it is not reasonably possible that a loss that is material has been incurred in this case.

429,Offerings 2017.md,334,LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY,334.42,Note 15—Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted:,334.42.1,,"In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This standard replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, which in many cases was tailored for specific industries, with a uniform accounting standard applicable to all industries and transactions. The new standard, as amended, is currently effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2018. Entities may elect to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 retrospectively for all periods for all contracts and transactions which occurred during the period (with a few exceptions for practical expediency) or retrospectively with a cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. ASU No. 2014-09 is a fundamental rewriting of existing GAAP with respect to revenue recognition, and we are still evaluating the effect the standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently expect to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach to adoption. Our sales generally involve single performance obligations to ship goods pursuant to customer purchase orders without further underlying contracts, and as such we expect adoption of this standard will have a minimal effect on our revenues. We are in the process of evaluating the additional disclosure requirements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall _(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,_ which addresses certain aspects related to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU requires equity investments (except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of the investee) to generally be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendment also requires a number of other changes, including among others: simplifying the impairment assessment for equity instruments without readily determinable fair values; eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose methods and assumptions used to determine fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost; requiring an exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; and requiring separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of asset. The changes indicated above will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, with prospective application required, and early adoption is not permitted. The most significant aspect of adopting this ASU will be the requirement to recognize changes in fair value of our available-for-sale marketable equity securities in net income (currently changes in fair value of such securities are recognized in other comprehensive income). In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which is a comprehensive rewriting of the lease accounting guidance which aims to increase comparability and transparency with regard to lease transactions. The primary change will be the recognition of lease assets for the right-of-use of the underlying asset and lease liabilities for the obligation to make payments by lessees on the balance sheet for leases currently classified as operating leases. The ASU also requires increased qualitative disclosure about leases in addition to quantitative disclosures currently required. Companies are required to use a modified FB-17 ----- retrospective approach to adoption with a practical expedient which will allow companies to continue to account for existing leases under the prior guidance unless a lease is modified, other than the requirement to recognize the right-of-use asset and lease liability for all operating leases. The changes indicated above will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of assessing all of our current leases. We have not yet evaluated the effect this ASU will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, but given the material amount of our future minimum payments under noncancellable operating leases at December 31, 2016 discussed in Note 17 to our 2016 Annual Report, we expect to recognize a material right-of-use lease asset and lease liability upon adoption of the ASU. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits _(Topic 715) Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic_ defined benefit pension and OPEB cost be reported in the same line item as other compensation costs for applicable employees incurred during the period. Other components of such net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component, and below income from operations (if such a subtotal is presented). These other net benefit cost components must be disclosed either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements. In addition only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization in assets where applicable (inventory or internally constructed fixed assets for example). The amendments in ASU 2017-06 are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, early adoption as of the beginning of an annual period is permitted, retrospective presentation is required for the income statement presentation of the service cost component and other components of net benefit cost, and prospective application is required for the capitalization in assets of the service cost component of net benefit cost. We expect to adopt this ASU in the first quarter of 2018. We currently include all of our net benefit cost for defined benefit pension plans as part of compensation expense which is capitalized into inventory, we present a subtotal for income from operations and our net periodic defined benefit pension cost is currently included in the determination of income from operations. Accordingly, adoption of this standard will change the amount of our aggregate compensation cost capitalized in inventory, and change the determination of the amount we report as income from operations. As disclosed in Note 10 to our 2016 Annual Report, the service cost component represented approximately $9.9 million of our total net periodic defined benefit pension costs of $22.0 million in 2016. None of the components of our net OPEB cost, or our total OPEB cost, were material in 2016.

For 2014, 2015 and 2016, the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets invested in the CMRT was 7.5%, based on the long-term asset mix of the assets of the CMRT and the expected longterm rates of return for such asset components as well as advice from Contran’s actuaries. The CMRT unit value is determined semi-monthly, and the plans have the ability to redeem all or any portion of their investment in the CMRT at any time based on the most recent semimonthly valuation. However, the plans do not have the right to individual assets held by the CMRT and the CMRT has the sole discretion in determining how to meet any redemption FA-21 ----- request. For purposes of our plan asset disclosure, we consider the investment in the CMRT as a Level 2 input because (i) the CMRT value is established semi-monthly and the plans have the right to redeem their investment in the CMRT, in part or in whole, at any time based on the most recent value and (ii) observable inputs from Level 1 or Level 2 (or assets not subject to classification in the fair value hierarchy) were used to value approximately 91% and 92% of the assets of the CMRT at December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, as noted below. CMRT assets not subject to classification in the fair value hierarchy consist principally of certain investments measured at net asset value per share in accordance with ASC 820-10. The aggregate fair value of all of the CMRT assets, including funds of Contran and its other affiliates that also invest in the CMRT, and supplemental asset mix details of the CMRT are as follows: Net periodic OPEB cost (benefit): Service cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ .1 $ .1 $ .1 Interest cost . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4 .3 .3 Amortization of prior service credit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The weighted average discount rate was determined using the projected benefit obligation as of such dates. The impact of assumed increases in future compensation levels does not have a material effect on the actuarial present value of the benefit obligation as substantially all of such benefits relate solely to eligible retirees, for which compensation is not applicable. **2015** **2016** Healthcare inflation: Initial rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.0% 7.0% Ultimate rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5.0% 5.0% Year of ultimate rate achievement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2021 2021 Weighted average discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.9% 3.5% Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the amounts we report for health care plans. A one percent change in assumed health care trend rates would not have a material effect on the net periodic OPEB cost for 2016 or on the accumulated OPEB obligation at December 31, 2016. The weighted average discount rate used in determining the net periodic OPEB cost for 2016 was 3.9% (2015—3.7%; 2014—4.6%). Such weighted average rate was determined using the projected benefit obligation as of the beginning of each year. The impact of assumed increases in future compensation levels does not have a material effect on the net periodic OPEB cost as substantially all of such benefits relate solely to eligible retirees, for which compensation is not applicable. The impact of the assumed rate of return on plan assets also does not have a material effect on the net periodic OPEB cost as there were no plan assets as of December 31, 2015 or 2016. Variances from actuarially-assumed rates will result in additional increases or decreases in accumulated OPEB obligations, net periodic OPEB cost and funding requirements in future periods.

The amount shown on such table for incremental net tax expense (benefit) on earnings and losses on non-U.S. companies includes, as applicable, (i) current income taxes (including withholding taxes, if applicable), if any, associated with any current-year earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent such currentyear earnings were distributed to us in the current year, (ii) deferred income taxes (or deferred income tax benefit) associated with the current-year change in the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of our Canadian subsidiary, which earnings are not subject to a permanent reinvestment plan, in an amount representing the current-year change in the aggregate current income tax that would be generated (including withholding taxes, if applicable) when such aggregate undistributed earnings are distributed to us, and (iii) current U.S. income taxes (or current income tax benefit), including U.S. personal holding company tax, as applicable, attributable to current-year income (losses) of one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which subsidiary is treated as a dual resident for U.S. income tax purposes, to the extent the current-year income (losses) of such subsidiary is subject to U.S. income tax under the U.S. dual-resident provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

At December 31, 2016, we currently estimate that our unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by $6.3 million excluding interest during the next twelve months related to certain adjustments to our prior year returns and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. We and Contran file income tax returns in U.S. federal and various state and local jurisdictions. We also file income tax returns in various non-U.S. jurisdictions, principally in Germany, Canada, Belgium and Norway. Our U.S. income tax returns prior to 2013 are generally considered closed to examination by applicable tax authorities. Our non-U.S. income tax returns are generally considered closed to examination for years prior to 2012 for Germany, 2013 for Belgium, 2011 for Canada and 2007 for Norway.

Interest rate swap contract . . . $(3.1) $ — $(3.1) $— Noncurrent marketable securities (See Note 6) . . . . . 6.0 6.0 — — Our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. Our risk management policy allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage exposure to currency exchange rates and interest rates. Derivatives that we use are primarily currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. We have not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past, nor do we currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future. _Currency forward contracts—Certain of our sales generated by our non-U.S. operations are_ denominated in U.S. dollars. We periodically use currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of currency exchange rate risk associated with trade receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder’s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales. Derivatives used to hedge forecasted transactions and specific cash flows associated with financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges. Consequently, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Contracts that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are markedto-market at each balance sheet date with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently as part of net currency transaction gains and losses. The fair value of the currency forward contracts is determined using Level 1 inputs based on the currency spot forward rates quoted by banks or currency dealers. At December 31, 2016, we had no currency forward contracts outstanding. The estimated value of such currency forward contracts at December 31, 2015 was a $1.2 million net liability, which is recognized as part of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at such date. We did not use hedge accounting for any of our contracts to the extent we held such contracts during 2014, 2015 and 2016. _Interest rate swap contract—As part of our interest rate risk management strategy, in_ August 2015 we entered into a pay-fixed/receive-variable interest rate swap contract with Wells FA-40 ----- Fargo Bank, N.A. to minimize our exposure to volatility in LIBOR as it relates to our forecasted outstanding variable-rate indebtedness. Under this interest rate swap, we will pay a fixed rate of 2.016% per annum, payable quarterly, and receive a variable rate of three-month LIBOR (subject to a 1.00% floor), also payable quarterly, in each case based on the notional amount of the swap then outstanding. The effective date of the swap contract was September 30, 2015. The notional amount of the swap started at $344.8 million and declines by $875,000 each quarter beginning December 31, 2015, with a final maturity of the swap contract in February 2020. The notional amount of the swap as of December 31, 2016 was $340.4 million. This swap contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge and qualified as an effective hedge at inception under ASC Topic 815. The effective portion of changes in fair value on this interest rate swap is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, net of deferred income taxes. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015, as interest expense accrues on LIBOR-based variable rate debt, we classify the amount we pay under the pay-fixed leg of the swap and the amount we receive under the receive-variable leg of the swap as part of interest expense, with the net effect that the amount of interest expense we recognize on our LIBOR-based variable rate debt each quarter, as it relates to the notional amount of the swap outstanding each quarter, to be based on a fixed rate of 2.016% per annum in lieu of the level of LIBOR prevailing during the quarter. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness, if any, related to the swap will be recorded in earnings (also as part of interest expense). Since the inception of the swap through December 31, 2016, there have been no gains or losses recognized in earnings in the current period representing hedge ineffectiveness with respect to the interest rate swap. During 2015 and 2016, the pretax unrealized loss arising during the year and recognized in other comprehensive income related to the interest rate swap contract was $4.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively. During 2015 and 2016, $.9 million and $3.5 million, respectively, were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings (interest expense). During the next twelve months, the amount of the December 31, 2016 accumulated other comprehensive income balance that is expected to be reclassified to earnings is $3.5 million pre-tax. The fair value of the interest rate swap contract at December 31, 2016 was a $3.1 million liability including $2.9 million recognized as part of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $.2 million recognized as part of other noncurrent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet (at December 31, 2015, we had a $3.5 million liability of which $3.3 million was recognized as part of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $.2 million recognized as part of other noncurrent liabilities). See Notes 9 and 11. The fair value of the interest rate swap was estimated by a third party using inputs that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves, and therefore, is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The following table presents the financial instruments that are not carried at fair value but which require fair value disclosure as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

The term loan_ was issued at 99.5% of the principal amount, or an aggregate of $348.3 million. We used $170 million of the net proceeds of the term loan to prepay the outstanding principal balance of our note payable to Contran (along with accrued and unpaid interest through the prepayment date) and such note payable was cancelled. The remaining net proceeds of the term loan were available for our general corporate purposes. The term loan, as amended in May 2015: - bears interest, at our option, at LIBOR (with LIBOR no less than 1.0%) plus 3.00%, or the base rate, as defined in the agreement, plus 2.00%; - requires quarterly principal repayments of $875,000 which commenced in June 2014, other mandatory principal repayments of formula-determined amounts under specified conditions with all remaining principal balance due in February 2020. Voluntary principal prepayments are permitted at any time; - is collateralized by, among other things, a first priority lien on (i) 100% of the common stock of certain of our U.S. wholly-owned subsidiaries, (ii) 65% of the common stock or other ownership interest of our Canadian subsidiary (Kronos Canada, Inc.) and certain first-tier European subsidiaries (Kronos Titan GmbH and Kronos Denmark ApS) and (iii) a $395.7 million unsecured promissory note issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kronos International, Inc. (KII) to us; - is also collateralized by a second priority lien on all of the U.S. assets which collateralize our North American revolving facility, as discussed below; - contains a number of covenants and restrictions which, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, pay dividends or merge or consolidate with, or sell or transfer substantially all of our assets to, another entity and contains other provisions and restrictive covenants customary in lending transactions of this type (however, there are no ongoing financial maintenance covenants); and - contains customary default provisions, including a default under any of our other indebtedness in excess of $50 million. Prior to the May 2015 amendment to the term loan, the applicable margin on outstanding LIBOR-based borrowings was 3.75% and the applicable margin on outstanding base rate borrowings was 2.75%. All other terms of the term loan, including principal repayments, maturity and collateral remain unchanged. We accounted for such amendment to our term loan as a modification of the terms of the term loan. We paid a $750,000 refinancing fee in connection with this amendment, which along with the existing unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the term loan are being amortized over the remaining term of the loan. The average interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 4.0% as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. The carrying value of the term loan at December 31, 2016 is stated FA-15 ----- net of unamortized original issue discount of $.9 million and debt issuance costs of $3.6 million (December 31, 2015—$1.2 million and $4.7 million). See Note 18 for a discussion of the interest rate swap we entered into in the third quarter of 2015 pursuant to our interest rate risk management strategy. _Revolving credit facilities Revolving North American credit facility—In June 2012, we entered into a $125 million_ revolving bank credit facility. As amended in January 2017, the facility matures the earlier of (i) January 30, 2022 or (ii) 90 days prior to the maturity date of our term loan (or the maturity date of any new term loan constituting a permitted refinancing of the existing term loan). Based on the February 2020 maturity date of our existing term loan, the maturity date of the North American credit facility is currently November 2019. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available for our general corporate purposes. Available borrowings on this facility are based on formula-determined amounts of eligible trade receivables and inventories, as defined in the agreement, of certain of our North American subsidiaries less any outstanding letters of credit up to $15 million issued under the facility (with revolving borrowings by our Canadian subsidiary limited to $25 million). Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.5% to 2.0% or at the applicable base rate, as defined in the agreement, plus a margin ranging from .5% to 1.0%. The credit facility is collateralized by, among other things, a first priority lien on the borrowers’ trade receivables and inventories. The facility contains a number of covenants and restrictions which, among other things, restricts the borrowers’ ability to incur additional debt, incur liens, pay dividends or merge or consolidate with, or sell or transfer all or substantially all of their assets to, another entity, contains other provisions and restrictive covenants customary in lending transactions of this type and under certain conditions requires the maintenance of a specified financial covenant (fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined) to be at least 1.1 to 1.0. We had no borrowings or repayments under this facility during 2015. During 2016, we borrowed $266.2 million and repaid $266.2 million under this facility. At December 31, 2016 we had approximately $74.8 million available for borrowing under this revolving facility. _Revolving European credit facility—Our operating subsidiaries in Germany, Belgium,_ Norway and Denmark have a €120 million secured revolving bank credit facility that matures in September 2017. We expect to extend the maturity date of this facility on or prior to its maturity date. We may denominate borrowings in euros, Norwegian kroner or U.S. dollars. Outstanding borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.90%. The facility is collateralized by the accounts receivable and inventories of the borrowers, plus a limited pledge of all of the other assets of the Belgian borrower. The facility contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of the borrowers to incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends or merge or consolidate with, or sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets to, another entity, and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios. In addition, the credit facility contains customary cross-default provisions with respect to other debt and obligations of the borrowers, KII and its other subsidiaries. We had no borrowings or repayments under this facility during 2015 and 2016 and at December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility. Our European revolving credit facility requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios, and one of such requirements is based on the ratio of net debt to last twelve months earnings before income tax, interest, depreciation and amortization expense (EBITDA) of the borrowers. Based upon the borrowers’ last twelve months EBITDA as of December 31, 2016 and the net debt to EBITDA financial test, our borrowing availability at December 31, 2016 is approximately 47% of the credit facility, or €55.8 million ($58.5 million).

In addition, we receive third-party advice about appropriate long-term rates of return. Such assumed asset mixes are summarized below: - In Germany, the composition of our plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the German insurance commissioner. Our German pension plan assets represent an investment in a large collective investment fund established and maintained by Bayer AG in which several pension plans, including our German pension plan and Bayer’s pension plans, have invested. Our plan assets represent a very nominal portion of the total collective investment fund maintained by Bayer. These plan assets are a Level 3 input because there is not an active market that approximates the value of our investment in the Bayer investment fund. We determine the fair value of the Bayer plan assets based on periodic reports we receive from the managers of the Bayer plan. These periodic reports are subject to audit by the German pension regulator. - In Canada, we currently have a plan asset target allocation of 35% to equity securities and 65% to fixed income securities. We expect the long-term rate of return for such investments to average approximately 125 basis points above the applicable equity or FA-22 ----- fixed income index. The Canadian assets are Level 1 inputs because they are traded in active markets. � In Norway, we currently have a plan asset target allocation of 11% to equity securities, 79% to fixed income securities, 7% to real estate and the remainder primarily to other investments and liquid investments such as money markets. The expected long-term rate of return for such investments is approximately 7%, 3%, 5% and 7%, respectively. The majority of Norwegian plan assets are Level 1 inputs because they are traded in active markets; however approximately 11% of our Norwegian plan assets are invested in real estate and other investments not actively traded and are therefore a Level 3 input. � We also have plan assets in Belgium and the United Kingdom. The Belgian plan assets are invested in certain individualized fixed income insurance contracts for the benefit of each plan participant as required by the local regulators and are therefore a Level 3 input. The United Kingdom plan assets consist of marketable securities which are Level 1 inputs because they trade in active markets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation for each plan, and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation and/or maximize the overall long-term return when considered appropriate.

These amounts will be recognized as components of our periodic OPEB cost in future years and are recognized, net of deferred income taxes, in our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We expect to recognize approximately $.2 million of unrecognized actuarial losses and $.6 million of prior service credit as components of our periodic OPEB cost in 2017.

See Note 5. Purchases of TiO2 from LPC were $193.1 million in 2014, $176.5 million in 2015 and $157.9 million in 2016. Sales of feedstock to LPC were $98.4 million in 2014, $80.6 million in 2015 and $68.8 million in 2016. From time to time, we may have loans and advances outstanding between us and various related parties pursuant to term and demand notes. We generally enter into these loans and advances for cash management purposes. When we loan funds to related parties, we are generally able to earn a higher rate of return on the loan than we would earn if we invested the funds in other instruments, and when we borrow from related parties, we are generally able to pay a lower rate of interest than we would pay if we had incurred third-party indebtedness. While certain of these loans to affiliates may be of a lesser credit quality than cash equivalent FA-35 ----- instruments otherwise available to us, we believe we have considered the credit risks in the terms of the applicable loans. In this regard: - In November 2010, we entered into an unsecured revolving demand promissory note with Valhi whereby, as amended, we agreed to loan Valhi up to $60 million. Our loan to Valhi bears interest at prime plus 1.00%, payable quarterly, with all principal due on demand, but in any event no earlier than December 31, 2018. The amount of our outstanding loans to Valhi at any time is at our discretion. As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had no outstanding loans to Valhi under this promissory note; and - In February 2013, we entered into a promissory note with Contran in which we borrowed $190 million on this note and subsequently repaid $20 million during 2013. We prepaid and cancelled this note payable to Contran in February 2014 using a portion of the net proceeds of our new term loan. See Note 8. Interest income (including unused commitment fees) on our loan to Valhi was $.5 million in each of 2014 and 2015 and $.4 million in 2016. Interest expense on our loan from Contran was $1.6 million in 2014. Under the terms of various intercorporate services agreements (ISAs) entered into between us and various related parties, including Contran, employees of one company will provide certain management, tax planning, financial and administrative services to the other company on a fee basis. Such charges are based upon estimates of the time devoted by the employees of the provider of the services to the affairs of the recipient, and the compensation and associated expenses of such persons. Because of the large number of companies affiliated with Contran, we believe we benefit from cost savings and economies of scale gained by not having certain management, financial and administrative staffs duplicated at each entity, thus allowing certain individuals to provide services to multiple companies but only be compensated by one entity. The net ISA fee charged to us, approved by the independent members of our board of directors, is included in selling, general and administrative expense and corporate expense and was $12.3 million in 2014, $13.4 million in 2015 and $15.2 million in 2016. This agreement is renewed annually and we expect to pay approximately $15.7 million under the ISA during 2017. Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including us, purchase certain of their insurance policies as a group, with the costs of the jointly-owned policies being apportioned among the participating companies. Tall Pines Insurance Company and EWI RE, Inc., each subsidiaries of Valhi, provide for or broker certain insurance policies for Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including ourselves. Tall Pines purchases reinsurance from thirdparty insurance carriers with an A.M. Best Company rating of generally at least A-(excellent) for substantially all of the risks it underwrites. Consistent with insurance industry practices, Tall Pines and EWI receive commissions from insurance and reinsurance underwriters and/or assess fees for the policies that they provide or broker. The aggregate premiums paid to Tall Pines and EWI by us and our joint venture were $10.7 million in 2014, $10.3 million in 2015 and $9.2 million in 2016. These amounts principally represent payments for insurance premiums, which include premiums or fees paid to Tall Pines or fees paid to EWI. These amounts also include payments to insurers or reinsurers through EWI for the reimbursement of claims within our applicable deductible or retention ranges that such insurers or reinsurers paid to third parties on our behalf, as well as amounts for claims and risk management services and various other third-party fees and expenses incurred by the program. We expect these relationships with Tall Pines and EWI will continue in 2017. With respect to certain of such jointly-owned policies, it is possible that unusually large losses incurred by one or more insureds during a given policy period could leave the other FA-36 ----- participating companies without adequate coverage under that policy for the balance of the policy period. As a result, and in the event that the available coverage under a particular policy would become exhausted by one or more claims, Contran and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including us, have entered into a loss sharing agreement under which any uninsured loss arising because the available coverage had been exhausted by one or more claims will be shared ratably amongst those entities that had submitted claims under the relevant policy. We believe the benefits, in the form of reduced premiums and broader coverage associated with the group coverage for such policies, justifies the risk associated with the potential for any uninsured loss. Contran and certain of its subsidiaries, including us, participate in a combined information technology data recovery program that Contran provides from a data recovery center that it established. Pursuant to the program, Contran and certain of its subsidiaries, including us, as a group share information technology data recovery services. The program apportions its costs among the participating companies. We paid Contran $.1 million in each of 2014, 2015 and 2016 for such services. We expect that this relationship with Contran will continue in 2017.",N/A,as_expected,2017,289

A portion of such expected cost savings is planned to occur through workforce reductions. During the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015 we implemented certain voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions at certain of our facilities impacting approximately 160 individuals. A substantial portion of such workforce reductions were accomplished through voluntary programs, for which eligible workforce reduction costs are recognized at the time both the employee and employer are irrevocably committed to the terms of the separation. For involuntary programs, eligible costs are recognized when management approves the separation program, the affected employees are properly notified and the costs are estimable. To the extent there is a statutorily-mandated notice period and the affected employee is not required to provide services to us during such notice period, severance and all wages during such notice period are accrued at the time of separation. To the extent the affected employee is required to provide services to us during all or a portion of such notice period, the severance (and if applicable notice period wages for any period beyond the time the affected employee is required to provide future services to us) is accrued ratably over the period in which services will be provided. As of December 31, 2015 we had recognized an aggregate $21.7 million charge for such workforce reductions we had implemented through that date (substantially all of which was recognized in the second quarter of 2015), $10.8 million of which is classified in cost of sales and $10.9 million of which is classified in selling, general and administrative expense. For workforce reductions implemented through December 31, 2015, we do not expect to accrue any further material amounts associated with the affected individuals who are providing service to us past December 31, 2015. Substantially all of the accrued severance costs at December 31, 2016 are expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2017.

As a result, we have net deferred income tax assets recognized with respect to these two jurisdictions, primarily related to these NOL carryforwards. The German corporate tax is similar to the U.S. federal income tax, and the German trade tax is similar to the U.S. state income tax. Prior to June 30, 2015, and using all available evidence, we had concluded no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was required to be recognized with respect to these net deferred income tax assets under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria, primarily because (i) the carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period, (ii) we utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three-year period, and (iii) we expect to utilize the remainder of the carryforwards over the long term. We had also previously indicated that facts and circumstances could change, which might in the future result in the recognition of a valuation allowance against some or all of such deferred income tax assets. However, as of June 30, 2015, and given our operating results during the second quarter of 2015 and our expectations at that time for our operating results for the remainder of 2015, we did not have sufficient positive evidence to overcome the significant negative evidence of having cumulative losses in the most recent twelve consecutive quarters in both our German and Belgian jurisdictions at June 30, 2015 (even considering that the carryforward period of our German and Belgian NOL carryforwards is indefinite, one piece of positive evidence). Accordingly, at June 30, 2015, we concluded that we were required to recognize a non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria with respect to our German and Belgian net deferred income tax assets. Such valuation allowance aggregated FA-30 ----- $150.3 million at June 30, 2015. We recognized an additional $8.7 million non-cash deferred income tax asset valuation allowance under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. During 2016, we recognized an aggregate $2.2 million noncash tax benefit as the result of a net decrease in such deferred income tax valuation allowance, as the impact of utilizing a portion of our German NOLs during such period more than offset the impact of additional losses recognized by our Belgian operations during such period. In addition to the aggregate $159.0 million increase and $2.2 million decrease in the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance recognized as part of the provision for income taxes in 2015 and 2016, respectively, the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance also increased by an aggregate of $9.8 million in 2015 and $6.7 million in 2016 due to amounts recognized in other comprehensive income. Tax authorities are examining certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. tax returns and have or may propose tax deficiencies, including penalties and interest. Because of the inherent uncertainties involved in settlement initiatives and court and tax proceedings, we cannot guarantee that these tax matters will be resolved in our favor, and therefore our potential exposure, if any, is also uncertain. - In 2011 and 2012 we received notices of re-assessment from the Canadian federal and provincial tax authorities related to the years 2002 through 2004. We objected to the reassessments and believed the position was without merit. Accordingly, we appealed the re-assessments and in connection with such appeal we were required to post letters of credit aggregating Cdn. $7.9 million. In 2014, the Appeals Division of the Canadian Revenue Authority ruled in our favor and reversed in their entirety such notices of reassessment. As a result, we recognized a non-cash income tax benefit of $3.0 million related to the release of a portion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions in 2014 related to the completion of this Canadian income tax audit. In addition, the related letters of credit have been cancelled. - Also during 2014, we recognized a non-cash income tax benefit of $3.1 million related to the release of a portion of our reserve for uncertain tax positions in conjunction with the completion of an audit of our U.S. income tax return for 2009. - As a result of ongoing audits in certain jurisdictions, in 2008 we filed Advance Pricing Agreement Requests with the tax authorities in the U.S., Canada and Germany. These requests have been under review with the respective tax authorities since 2008 and prior to 2016, it was uncertain whether an agreement would be reached between the tax authorities and whether we would agree to execute and finalize such agreements. During 2016, Contran, as the ultimate parent of our U.S. Consolidated income tax group, executed and finalized an Advance Pricing Agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and our Canadian subsidiary executed and finalized an Advance Pricing Agreement with the Competent Authority for Canada (collectively, the “U.S.-Canada APA”) effective for tax years 2005—2015. Pursuant to the terms of the U.S.-Canada APA, the U.S. and Canadian tax authorities agreed to certain prior year changes to taxable income of our U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries. As a result of such agreed-upon changes, we recognized a $3.4 million current U.S. income tax benefit in 2016. In addition, our Canadian subsidiary will incur a cash income tax payment of approximately CAD $3 million (USD $2.3 million) as a result of the U.S.-Canada APA, but such payment was fully offset by previously provided accruals (such USD $2.3 million has not been paid as of December 31, 2016, and is classified as part of income taxes payable at such date). We currently expect the Advance Pricing Agreement between Canada and Germany (collectively, the “Canada-Germany APA”) to be executed and finalized within the next twelve months. We believe we have adequate accruals to cover any cash FA-31 ----- income tax payment which might result from the finalization of the Canada-Germany APA, and accordingly we do not expect the execution of such APA to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We believe we have adequate accruals for additional taxes and related interest expense which could ultimately result from tax examinations. We believe the ultimate disposition of tax examinations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We accrue interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes. The amount of interest and penalties we accrued during 2014, 2015 and 2016 was not material, and at December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, we had $2.8 million, $2.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively, accrued for interest and penalties for our uncertain tax positions.

Certain of our operations are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations. As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of our past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage. We have implemented and continue to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks. Our policy is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all of our facilities and to strive to improve our environmental performance. From time to time, we may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under U.S. and non-U.S. statutes, the resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs. It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements of environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder, could adversely affect our production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of such substances. We believe all of our manufacturing facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. _Litigation matters—We are involved in various environmental, contractual, product liability,_ patent (or intellectual property), employment and other claims and disputes incidental to our business. At least quarterly our management discusses and evaluates the status of any pending litigation to which we are a party. The factors considered in such evaluation include, among other things, the nature of such pending cases, the status of such pending cases, the advice of legal counsel and our experience in similar cases (if any). Based on such evaluation, we make a determination as to whether we believe (i) it is probable a loss has been incurred, and if so if the amount of such loss (or a range of loss) is reasonably estimable, or (ii) it is reasonably possible but not probable a loss has been incurred, and if so if the amount of such loss (or a range of loss) is reasonably estimable, or (iii) the probability a loss has been incurred is remote. We have not accrued any amounts for either of the two pending matters discussed below, as it is not reasonably possible we have incurred a loss in either case that would be material to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In March 2013, we were served with the complaint, Los Gatos Mercantile, Inc. d/b/a Los Gatos Ace Hardware, et al v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company, et al.

The complaint alleges that the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price at which titanium dioxide was sold in the United States and engaged in other anticompetitive conduct. The case is now proceeding in the trial court. We believe the action is without merit, will deny all allegations of wrongdoing and liability and intend to defend against the action vigorously. Based on our quarterly status evaluation of this case, we have determined that it is not reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred in this case. In September 2016, we were served with the complaint, Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. v. E.I. Dupont Nemours and Company, et al. (United States District Court, for the Northern District of California, Case No. 3:16-cv-04865). The defendants include us, E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Company, Huntsman International LLC and Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc. The plaintiff alleges that it indirectly purchased titanium dioxide from one or more of the defendants on or after March 1, 2002. The complaint alleges that the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price at which titanium dioxide was sold in the United States and engaged in other anticompetitive conduct. The case is now proceeding in the trial court. We believe the action is without merit, will deny all allegations of wrongdoing and liability and intend to defend against the action vigorously. Based on our quarterly status evaluation of this case, we have determined that it is not reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred in this case. _Concentrations of credit risk—Sales of TiO2 accounted for 90%, 92% and 93% of our sales in_ 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The remaining sales result from the mining and sale of ilmenite ore (a raw material used in the sulfate pigment production process), and the manufacture and sale of iron-based water treatment chemicals and certain titanium chemical products (derived from co-products of the TiO2 production processes). TiO2 is generally sold to the paint, plastics and paper industries. Such markets are generally considered “quality-of-life” markets whose demand for TiO2 is influenced by the relative economic well-being of the various geographic regions. We sell TiO2 to over 4,000 customers, with the top ten customers approximating 35% of net sales in 2014, 34% in 2015 and 33% in 2016. In each of 2014, 2015 and 2016 one customer, Behr Process Corporation, accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales.

The agreements require us to purchase certain minimum quantities of feedstock with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $605 million over the life of the contracts in years subsequent to December 31, 2016. In addition, we have other long-term supply and service contracts that provide for various raw materials and services. These agreements require us to purchase certain minimum quantities or services with minimum purchase commitments aggregating approximately $158 million at December 31, 2016. FA-38 ----- _Operating leases—Our principal German operating subsidiary leases the land under its_ Leverkusen TiO2 production facility pursuant to a lease with Bayer AG that expires in 2050. The Leverkusen facility itself, which we own and which represents approximately one-third of our current TiO2 production capacity, is located within Bayer’s extensive manufacturing complex. We periodically establish the amount of rent for the land lease associated with the Leverkusen facility by agreement with Bayer for periods of at least two years at a time. The lease agreement provides for no formula, index or other mechanism to determine changes in the rent for such land lease; rather, any change in the rent is subject solely to periodic negotiation between Bayer and us. We recognize any change in the rent based on such negotiations as part of lease expense starting from the time such change is agreed upon by both parties, as any such change in the rent is deemed “contingent rentals” under GAAP. Under the terms of various supply and services agreements, majority-owned subsidiaries of Bayer provide raw materials, including chlorine, auxiliary and operating materials, utilities and services necessary to operate the Leverkusen facility. These agreements, as amended, expire in 2017 through 2019. We expect to renew these agreements prior to expiration at similar terms and conditions. We also lease various other manufacturing facilities and equipment. Some of the leases contain purchase and/or various term renewal options at fair market and fair rental values, respectively. In most cases we expect that, in the normal course of business, such leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Net rent expense approximated $16 million in 2014 and $14 million in each of 2015 and 2016.

429,Offerings 2017.md,335,LIABILITIES AND PARTNERS’ EQUITY,335.42,Note 19—Recent Accounting Pronouncements:,335.42.1,,"_Adopted_ In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of _Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This standard provides guidance on eight specific_ cash flow issues including: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, distributions from equity method investees and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The new standard is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2018. We have elected to adopt this ASU with this Annual Report without any material effect on the presentation of cash flows in our previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): _Restricted Cash. This standard provides guidance on the cash flow classification of changes in_ restricted cash and additional disclosure requirements regarding the nature of restrictions on cash. The new standard is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2018. We have elected to adopt this ASU retrospectively beginning with this Annual Report and accordingly we have presented all changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and provided additional disclosure regarding the composition and classification of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and related Footnotes. As a result, net cash used in investing activities increased from $54.0 million to $61.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and increased from $46.8 million to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the negative effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased from $9.4 million to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and increased from $8.4 million to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. _Pending adoption_ In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers _(Topic 606). This standard replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, which in many cases_ was tailored for specific industries, with a uniform accounting standard applicable to all industries and transactions. The new standard, as amended, is currently effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2018. Entities may elect to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 retrospectively for all periods for all contracts and transactions which occurred during the period (with a few exceptions for practical expediency) or retrospectively with a cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. ASU No. 2014-09 is a fundamental rewriting of existing GAAP with respect to revenue recognition, and we are still evaluating the effect the standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently expect to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach to adoption. Our sales generally involve single performance obligations to ship goods pursuant to customer purchase orders without further underlying contracts, and as such we expect adoption of this standard will have a minimal effect on our revenues. We are in the process of evaluating the additional disclosure requirements. FA-42 ----- In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall _(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,_ which addresses certain aspects related to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU requires equity investments (except for those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of the investee) to generally be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendment also requires a number of other changes, including among others: simplifying the impairment assessment for equity instruments without readily determinable fair values; eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose methods and assumptions used to determine fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost; requiring an exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; and requiring separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of asset. The changes indicated above will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018, with prospective application required, and early adoption is not permitted. The most significant aspect of adopting this ASU will be the requirement to recognize changes in fair value of our available-for-sale marketable equity securities in net income (currently changes in fair value of such securities are recognized in other comprehensive income). In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which is a comprehensive rewriting of the lease accounting guidance which aims to increase comparability and transparency with regard to lease transactions. The primary change will be the recognition of lease assets for the right-of-use of the underlying asset and lease liabilities for the obligation to make payments by lessees on the balance sheet for leases currently classified as operating leases. The ASU also requires increased qualitative disclosure about leases in addition to quantitative disclosures currently required. Companies are required to use a modified retrospective approach to adoption with a practical expedient which will allow companies to continue to account for existing leases under the prior guidance unless a lease is modified, other than the requirement to recognize the right-of-use asset and lease liability for all operating leases. The changes indicated above will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of assessing all of our current leases. We have not yet evaluated the effect this ASU will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, but given the material amount of our future minimum payments under noncancellable operating leases at December 31, 2016 discussed in Note 17, we expect to recognize a material right-of-use lease asset and lease liability upon adoption of the ASU.
