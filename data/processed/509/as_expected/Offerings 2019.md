NOTHING IN THIS ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION CONSTITUTES AN OFFER OF NOTES
FOR SALE IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE IT IS UNLAWFUL TO DO SO.

Confirmation of your Representation: In order to be eligible to view the attached preliminary offering
memorandum or make an investment decision with respect to the Notes, investors must be (i) non-U.S.
persons outside the United States (within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities Act) or (ii) a
QIB. By accepting this e-mail and accessing the preliminary offering memorandum, you shall be deemed to
have represented to us that you are a non-U.S. person that is outside the United States or that you are a
QIB; and that you consent to the delivery of such preliminary offering memorandum by electronic
transmission. You are reminded that the preliminary offering memorandum has been delivered to you on
the basis that you are a person into whose possession the preliminary offering memorandum may be
lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not,
nor are you authorized to, deliver the preliminary offering memorandum to any other person or make
copies of the preliminary offering memorandum.

Under no circumstances shall the preliminary offering memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of Notes, in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
solicitation or sale would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering and sale of the Notes be
made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers (as defined in the attached preliminary
offering memorandum) or any affiliate of theirs is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the
offering and sale of the Notes shall be deemed to be made by them or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer
(as defined in the attached preliminary offering memorandum) in such jurisdiction.

The preliminary offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional
experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the ‘‘Financial Promotion Order’’),
(ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) through (d) (‘‘high net worth companies, unincorporated
associations etc.’’) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are
persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any
Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together
being referred to as ‘‘relevant persons’’). This document is directed only at relevant persons and must not
be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to


-----

which this document relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant
persons.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the
‘‘EEA’’). For these purposes, a ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client
as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (‘‘MiFID II’’); or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the ‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of
MiFID II. No key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the ‘‘PRIIPs
Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the
EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is
eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration
the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The preliminary offering memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded
that documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic
transmission and consequently neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person who controls them nor any
director, officer, employee nor agent of them or affiliate of any such person accepts any liability or
responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the preliminary offering memorandum
distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version available to you on request from the
Initial Purchasers.

The information in the preliminary offering memorandum is not complete and may be changed. This
document does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to sell these securities or any
solicitation of any offer to purchase these securities in any jurisdiction where such offer or sale is not
permitted.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors—The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the European Economic Area (‘‘EEA’’). For these purposes, a ‘‘retail investor’’ means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU,
as amended (‘‘MiFID II’’); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the
‘‘Insurance Distribution Directive’’), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. No key information document required by Regulation
(EU) No 1286/2014 (the ‘‘PRIIPs Regulation’’) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs
Regulation. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

**MiFID II Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market—Solely for the**
purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling
or recommending the Notes (a ‘‘distributor’’) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements and the

Offering Memorandum have been prepared in accordance with IFRS in effect as of December 31, 2018,
and March 31, 2019, respectively, and the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in

examination of the Ardagh Carve-out Business, Exal, Trivium, the terms of the offering of the Notes and
the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. You should consult your own
professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how
those differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS and U.S. GAAP requires the use of
certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of
applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in
the financial statements.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared based
on a calendar year and are presented in U.S. dollars rounded to the nearest million. The Exal Consolidated
Financial Statements have been prepared based on a calendar year and are presented in U.S. dollars
rounded to the nearest thousand, while the financial information of Exal presented in this Offering
Memorandum has been rounded to the nearest million. Therefore, discrepancies in the tables between
totals and the sums of the amounts listed may occur due to such rounding.

Unless stated otherwise, debt balances are presented before deducting deferred financing costs.

**Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements included in this Offering
Memorandum have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ireland. The Ardagh Carve-out Business
Combined Carve-out Financial Statements reflect the metal food and specialty business of Ardagh
Group S.A. that have not in the past formed a separate accounting group. These businesses do not
constitute a separate legal entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements have been prepared by aggregating the financial information for the metal food and specialty
business, comprising the entities constituting the Ardagh Carve-out Business together with the assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the
Ardagh Carve-out Business.

For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Ardagh Carve-out
Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, please see Note 2 ‘‘Summary of Significant

xii


-----

Accounting Policies’’ to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This basis of preparation sets out the
method used in identifying the financial position, performance and cash flows of the metal food and
specialty business that has been included in Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements. The notes explain that the businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined
Carve-out Financial Statements have not operated as a separate stand-alone entity or group.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business adopted IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019, and applied the modified
retrospective approach which does not require restatement of prior periods. As detailed in Note 2 of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business Unaudited Interim Combined Financial Statements ‘‘Summary of significant
accounting policies,’’ the adoption of IFRS 16 impacts on the combined income statement and certain key
financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges recognized in the combined income
statement. The application of the new standard decreases both cost of sales and operating costs (excluding
depreciation) in the combined income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted
EBITDA, but this will be largely offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and finance expenses.

**Exal Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Exal Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum
have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP. The Exal Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Exal in conformity with U.S. GAAP. For a
complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Exal Consolidated Financial
Statements, please see Note 1 ‘‘Description of Business and Basis of Presentation’’ and Note 2 ‘‘Critical
and Significant Accounting Policies’’ to the Exal Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Pro Forma Financial Information**

While it has not yet been determined, the information contained in the unaudited pro forma
combined financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum has been presented on
the basis that Trivium will record the businesses contributed to it on formation at fair value, including
goodwill. This involves measuring the cost of the businesses contributed and allocating, at the Completion
Date, the cost of the businesses contributed to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
their respective fair values. Identifiable assets contributed and liabilities assumed will be measured initially
at their fair values at the Completion Date. Trivium intends to measure the consideration transferred to
each of the contributing parties, including Trivium equity transferred, at fair value.

The Combination has not been completed, and, as a result, we are not currently in a position to
measure fair values and make the related adjustments to the recorded values of identifiable assets and
liabilities of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and the Exal business, respectively. Following completion of
the accounting for the Combination (including measurement of fair values), we will make any necessary
adjustments to recorded values of the contributed assets and liabilities. We currently expect that the
majority of the adjustments will result in adjustments to property, plant and equipment, the creation of
intangible assets and goodwill and an increase in the fair value of inventory. The adjustments to intangible
assets are likely to result in additional charges for amortization, which will have a negative effect on
operating profit. Similarly, the adjustment to inventory will result in a corresponding increase in cost of
sales which will be recognized and reduce operating profit during the period in which the acquired
inventory is sold. The unaudited pro forma financial information included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum does not reflect any fair value accounting adjustments for the Combination. The
adjustments that will occur on completion of the final accounting for the Combination could have a
material impact on the pro forma combined financial information.

The unaudited pro forma income statement information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019,
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred
on April 1, 2018. The summary unaudited pro forma balance sheet data as of March 31, 2019, gives effect
to the Transactions as if they had occurred on that date. This unaudited pro forma financial information is
based on available information and various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable,
including the receipt of all consents and approvals required for completion of the Combination.
Completion of the Combination as contemplated in this Offering Memorandum is subject to legally
required staff consultation in certain jurisdictions. The actual results may differ significantly from those
reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not
limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma combined
financial information and actual amounts. The unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for
illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of
operations would have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects a number of adjustments made to the financial
information of the Exal business. It is expected that Trivium will follow the presentation and accounting
policies applied by Ardagh and so no adjustments are required to adjust the accounting policies and
presentation of financial information followed by the Ardagh Carve-out Business for purposes of the
unaudited pro forma financial information. The compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial
information and the adjustments reflected therein are explained as follows:

  - Adjustments have been made to convert the underlying U.S. GAAP financial information set forth
in the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS and in alignment with the expected IFRS
accounting policies of Trivium. These adjustments are based on management’s analysis of the major
GAAP and accounting policy differences between Trivium and the Exal Consolidated Financial
Statements. There can be no assurance that a full IFRS conversion of the financial information set
forth in the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements to be performed on completion of the
Combination would not result in different numbers, and such differences may be material.

   - The underlying financial information of Exal has been adjusted to align the presentation of certain
income statement items with the expected presentation of such financial information by Trivium.

The basis for the adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information and the key
assumptions made are explained in the notes to the information accompanying the tables.

The pro forma financial information presented within ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
Information’’ has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the
Exchange Act or U.S. GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information
has been audited or reviewed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) or U.S.
GAAS. The unaudited pro forma combined financial and other data set forth elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum should be read in conjunction with the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out
Financial Statements and the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto,
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Non-IFRS and Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

We present in this Offering Memorandum EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA margin and related ratios, which are
supplemental measures of our, the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ or Exal’s (as the context requires),
performance and liquidity that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS and, in relation
to the Exal Business, U.S. GAAP.

xiv


-----

In relation to Trivium, we define ‘‘Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA’’ as pro forma profit for the period
before income tax expense/(credit), net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional
operating items. We define ‘‘Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA’’ as Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA further adjusted for: the impact of new accounting standards with respect to leases, and the
impact of cost saving initiatives arising as a result of planned optimization, reorganization and operational
improvement initiatives. We defined ‘‘Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin’’ and ‘‘Pro Forma
Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA Margin’’ as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Supplemental
Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, divided by revenue.

In relation to the Ardagh Carve-out Business, we define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as profit before tax, net
finance expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional operating items, and ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA
margin’’ as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

In relation to the Exal Business, we define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as net income, plus the following
items: income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, certain one-item or
unusual items such as costs associated with the recovery from the Exal Packaging facility fire, impairment
of property, plant and equipment, South American financial taxes, management change costs, restructuring
expenses including severance and expenses associated with other special projects.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA margin and
Adjusted EBITDA margin and related ratios should not be considered in isolation and are not measures of
our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an
alternative to profit or loss for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with
IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of our
liquidity as derived in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS and non-GAAP financial measures do not
necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements and may not be
indicative of our results of operations. In addition, such measures, as we define them, may not be
comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.

**Industry and Market Data**

Given the specialized nature of the metal packaging markets in which we operate, there does not exist
a relevant and reliable third-party source of much of the relevant market information presented in this
Offering Memorandum. Therefore, estimates provided regarding these markets as set forth in this
Offering Memorandum, as well as estimated market shares of us or our competitors, are largely based on
our knowledge of these markets, developed primarily from analysis of public information, third-party
reports to the extent available, competitors’ public announcements and regulatory filings and information
gathered in the course of acquisitions. The data relating to market sizes, market share and market position
are based on the most recent data available. This information has not been confirmed by an independent
organization, nor can there be assurance that third parties would arrive at the same results were they to
employ different methods for gathering, analyzing and calculating such data. Breakdowns of market shares
were established on the basis of our consolidated revenues and these data. Market positions and
percentage shares are those that we believe it holds in terms of revenues. They are based on industry
market sectors on which our group business is arranged.

Certain additional information regarding the global packaging industry, generally, and the metal can
packaging sector, specifically, has been sourced from Smithers Pira, the Can Manufacturers Institute
(‘‘CMI’’), Research and Markets and Zion Market Research (‘‘Zion’’).

Any third-party information described above and included in this Offering Memorandum has been
accurately reproduced and, as far as we are aware, and are able to ascertain from the information
published by such third parties, the reproduced information is accurate and no facts have been omitted
which would render such information inaccurate or misleading. Market share data is subject to change,
however, and such third-party information has been prepared for statistical and other informational
purposes, which is limited by the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data
gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of market share.

Combination. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, neither the Parent Guarantor nor the Issuer
have any material assets or liabilities nor have the Parent Guarantor or the Issuer engaged in any activities
other than those related to their incorporation and registration and the Combination. Unless otherwise
required by the context, this Offering Memorandum presents our business and operations and other
information as if the Combination has occurred.

**Our Company**

We are a leading supplier of innovative, value-added, infinitely-recyclable metal packaging solutions.
Our products principally comprise metal packaging in the form of cans and aerosol containers, serving a
broad range of end use categories, including food, seafood, pet food and nutrition, as well as beauty and
personal care and beverage offerings, such as wine, energy, ready-to-drink coffee and premium beer. We
also supply the paints and coatings and general household care end use categories. Our customers include
a wide variety of leading consumer packaged goods (‘‘CPG’’) companies which value our packaging
solutions for their convenience and quality, as well as the end user appeal they offer through design,

1


-----

innovation, functionality, premium association and brand enhancement. With our significant invested
capital base, extensive technological capabilities and manufacturing know-how, we believe we are
well-positioned to continue to meet the dynamic needs of our global customers. Substantially all our
revenue is derived from end use categories where we believe we hold #1 or #2 positions within the
respective geographies we serve, and we aim to build on these leadership positions in these large, stable
and attractive markets in the future.

We serve over 1,300 customers across more than 70 countries, comprised of multi-national companies,
large national and regional companies and small local businesses. In our target regions of Europe, North
America and South America our customers include a wide variety of CPG companies, which own some of
the best-known brands in the world. We have a stable customer base with long-standing relationships,
including an average tenure of over 15 years with our ten largest customers. Approximately 60% of our
sales are generated under multi-year contracts, with the remainder largely subject to annual arrangements.
A significant portion of our revenues are generated under contracts which include input cost pass-through
provisions, which help us reduce margin volatility due to changes in raw material costs.

In 2018, Trivium had 57 facilities, located in 21 countries and had approximately 7,800 employees. Our
plants are well-located to serve our customers, with some located on-site or near-site to our customers’
filling locations. Certain facilities may also be dedicated to end use categories, generating benefits of scale
and production efficiencies. Significant capital has been invested in our well-invested and extensive
network of long-lived production facilities, which, together with our skilled workforce and related
manufacturing process know-how, supports our competitive positions.

Organic growth initiatives have also involved expansionary strategic investments in new capacity of
over $350 million in new facilities since 2013. Notable investments in this period have included: (i) two new
can-making facilities in Roanoke, Virginia and Reno, Nevada, as well as a significant expansion of our
Conklin, New York, ends plant; positioning us to meet substantially all the metal packaging requirements
of a major U.S. CPG company pursuant to a long-term contract; (ii) the material enhancement of our
South American aerosol production capabilities and capacity to serve growing demand in that region,
including the completion of a new state-of-the-art aluminum slug production facility; and (iii) consistent
investment in our European business in pursuit of growth opportunities in selected end use categories,
including the infant formula/nutrition market, where demand growth is driven by emerging market
consumption, and in single-serve pet food formats, where convenience and a trend to premium products is
evident. These initiatives, as well as other acquisitions and investments over many years, in both existing
and adjacent end use categories, have increased our scale and diversification and provided opportunities to
grow our business with existing and new customers.

We are committed to maintaining the industry leading innovation history of both the Ardagh
Carve-out Business and Exal. To this end, we focus on four main areas of research and development
(‘‘R&D’’): (i) innovations that provide improved product design, differentiation and usability;
(ii) innovations that reduce metal content to generate cost savings (down-gauging); (iii) developments to
meet evolving food safety standards and regulations; and (iv) innovations that address consumers’
preference for sustainable packaging by allowing our customers to migrate to metal as a packaging
material. Our worldwide manufacturing footprint is supported by a dedicated R&D center in France,
which has developed numerous award-winning innovations and solutions for our customers over many
years.

On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Combination, revenue and Pro Forma Supplemental
Adjusted EBITDA for Trivium for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 would have been
$2,687 million and $469 million, respectively. We also expect the combination to create Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA net benefits of approximately $40 million over the next few years through the pursuit of
commercial and operational excellence initiatives across Trivium’s business.

**_Our Competitive Strengths_**

   - Leading market player in substantially all of our diversified businesses. We believe we are one of the
leading solutions providers in each of our target end use categories, across the various geographies
in which we operate. Specifically, these end use categories are food, seafood, nutrition, beauty and
personal care and paints and coatings.

**Our Position by Geography and End Use Category**

**Geography** **Our Position** **End Use Category / Product**

Europe . . . . . . . . . . . _#1_ _Nutrition, paints and coatings_
_Aerosol containers, serving multiple end use_
_categories, including beauty and personal care,_
_food, household care and other uses_

_#2_ _Food, seafood_

North America . . . . . . _#2_ _Food (including seafood), beauty and personal_
_care_

South America . . . . . . _#1_ _Beauty and personal care_

   - Focus on end use categories with resilient demand, positive long-term trends and select growth opportunities.
Each of the broad end use categories served by us, comprising food, beverage and beauty and
personal care, are relatively mature and characterized by stable-to-growing consumer-driven
demand patterns. Within these categories, selective attractive growth opportunities arise from
various factors, including consumption trends, a desire for greater convenience and
premiumization, material shifts and a growing focus on sustainability by consumers and brand
owners. In particular, we believe those select growth opportunities include growth in lighter-weight
two-piece food cans in North America, increasing demand for single-serve products in end use
categories such as pet food and seafood, the shift from tinplate steel to aluminum aerosol
containers in North America, growth in aerosol markets in South America and growth in the
nutrition end use category. Specifically, volume growth for two-piece food cans in North America
has been 2% compound annual growth rate (‘‘CAGR’’) in the period from 2014 to 2018 according
to CMI. Demand for pet food in North America is expected to grow by 3.4% from 2017 to 2022
according to Zion. Aluminum aerosol containers benefit from the rising conversion from tinplate
steel to aluminum in the Americas with expected CAGR of 5% in North America and 6% in South
America based on management’s review and application of industry sources from 2018 to 2021.
Growth in nutrition of 5.7%, according to Research and Markets from 2019 to 2024, is supported by
demand growth in emerging markets, especially China, reflecting rising income standards and
changing demographic patterns.

   - Long-term and contracted relationships with a diverse blue-chip customer base. We supply some of the
world’s best-known brands with innovative packaging solutions. We have long-standing
relationships, with an average tenure of over 15 years with our ten largest customers, including with
leading multinational CPG companies, large national and regional food companies, as well as
numerous local companies. Our top ten customers are all under multi-year contracts, and represent
approximately 39% of our pro forma revenue, with our largest customer accounting for 11% of our
pro forma revenue. Our overall customer base is highly diversified, with our top twenty customers
representing 54% of our pro forma revenue. Some of our major customers include Akzo Nobel,
Alicorp, Bayer, Beiersdorf, ConAgra Brands, COTY, Danone, Friesland Campina, Groupe d’Aucy,
Grupo Queruclor, JM Smucker, Johnson & Johnson, L’Or´eal, Mars, Reckitt Benckiser, Mondelez
International, Nestl´e, O Botic´ario, Thai Union, The Kraft Heinz Company and Unilever.

-----

Approximately 60% of our revenues are derived from multi-year contracts, most of which include
input cost pass-through provisions.

- Strategically-located and cost-efficient global manufacturing base. We have 57 facilities and
approximately 7,800 employees located across 21 countries, primarily in Europe, North America
and South America. We have 46 facilities in our Europe segment (including one plant in each of
Morocco, South Korea and the Seychelles), 7 in North America and 4 in South America. Our
presence in Europe provides us with a scalable and flexible manufacturing footprint and accounts
for approximately 73% of our pro forma revenue. In the past years, the Ardagh Carve-out Business
has migrated a majority of its component production in Europe to lower-cost labor regions in
Europe, while maintaining can assembly close to its customers. In the Americas, which accounts for
approximately 27% of our pro forma revenue (21% from North America and 6% from South
America), our North American footprint serves customers nationally, while our presence in South
America includes an integrated slug facility, which provides us with a cost-efficient supply of high
quality slugs. We have a well-invested asset base, with over $350 million invested in the past five
years in new production facilities, supported by in-house research and development expertise. We
expect to continue to pursue cost reduction and efficiency opportunities in the form of footprint
optimization, component migration, manufacturing and operational excellence initiatives, including
lean six-sigma implementation and complexity reduction programs.

- Strong track record of packaging innovation leadership. We have been consistently recognized as a
leading industry innovator in the development and application of processes and products that
enhance the end-user experience and enable our customers to promote and differentiate their
brands. Our commitment, scale and dedicated R&D and engineering resources, have meant that, in
conjunction with our customers, we consistently deliver solutions that offer greater consumer
convenience and functionality, respond to developing market trends, including sustainability, and
help our customers address regulatory changes ahead of time. Examples of our innovations include
our leading role in metal down-gauging initiatives, our investments in draw and wall ironing
(‘‘DWI’’) can production in Europe and North America, lightweight easy-open end solutions and
coating solutions to meet new requirements related to bisphenol A (‘‘BPA’’) in Europe. Product
innovation has included advanced shaping solutions in nutrition cans to offer greater brand
differentiation, enhanced hygiene features and tamper-proof protection, as well as new offerings in
single-serve packaging for a wide variety of applications. Our product offerings also address and
promote the secular shift from steel to aluminum aerosols in the Americas and the potential growth
of new premium beverage applications for aluminum bottles, including beer, wines and
ready-to-drink coffees.

- Consistently strong financial profile. We have an attractive financial profile highlighted by consistently
strong Adjusted EBITDA in each of our two businesses and robust free cash flow generation. Our
attractive combined financial performance is underpinned by our recurring sales into stable end use
categories that have select attractive growth opportunities, our demonstrated ability to pass through
changes in raw material prices to our customers and our consistent track record of delivering cost
savings and moderate maintenance capital expenditure requirements anticipated to be
approximately $40 million annually. These factors culminate in an attractive and consistent free
cash flow profile, which we expect will enable us to reduce leverage through debt repayment and
Adjusted EBITDA growth over time. Further, each of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal
have a demonstrable track record of Adjusted EBITDA growth with a CAGR of 3.3% and 10.1%,
respectively from 2016 to 2018.

- Proven leadership team focused on value creation supported by long-term focused shareholders. We have
an experienced and talented leadership team, led by our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Mapes.
Michael Mapes and members of our management team have extensive experience and a strong
track record of value creation in the consumer packaging industry, including the successful

repositioning and expansion of Exal through the implementation of our proven business system
approach. Members of our management team have also delivered consistently strong performance
in the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ consumer packaging business. We further benefit from the
continuity provided by our shareholders, who have demonstrated a long-term investment horizon
and record of value delivery. The shareholders of the Parent Guarantor, Ontario Teachers’ Pension
Plan, the largest single-profession pension plan in Canada, with approximately C$191 billion in net
assets as of December 31, 2018, and the Ardagh Group, a leading global packaging solutions
provider with annual revenues of over $9 billion in 2018, will own approximately 57% and 43% of
our equity, respectively. Ardagh Chairman and CEO, Paul Coulson, will be the chairman of the
supervisory board of directors of the Parent Guarantor.

**_Our Business Strategy_**

We plan to implement our proven business system approach to drive value creation, achieve our
principal objective of growth in Adjusted EBITDA and cash generation and continue to drive a culture of
commercial excellence. We pursue these objectives through the following strategies:

   - Grow Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow. We seek to leverage our extensive footprint, proximity to our
customers, commercial excellence, efficient manufacturing and high level of customer service to
grow our revenue through the provision of innovative and sustainable packaging solutions to new
and existing customers. We will continue to take decisive actions with respect to our assets and
invest in our business in order to increase Adjusted EBITDA, in line with our stringent investment
criteria. To grow cash generation, we continue to actively manage our working capital and capital
expenditures. We will aim to execute on identified growth and costs savings projects, deliver
commercial excellence targets and continually improve through ongoing operational benchmarking
and sharing of best practices.

  - Provide sustainable packaging solutions. We will continue to work with our customers to provide
innovative and sustainable packaging solutions to meet their own ambitious environmental and
sustainability objectives and commitments. Metal is the most recycled packaging material globally
and can be infinitely recycled without any degradation in quality. We expect to leverage these
attributes of metal packaging to develop new applications, including those arising from conversion
from other packaging formats. Our dedicated R&D capabilities mean that we are well-positioned to
capitalize on such pack-mix shifts, given our sole focus on sustainable packaging solutions.

   - Enhance product mix and profitability. Backed by our scale and record of innovation, we intend to
grow our business with existing and new customers. Working in partnership with our customers, we
intend to build on our existing leadership positions in our businesses. We also intend to pursue
selective growth opportunities across our product portfolio by offering packaging solutions that
address needs or desires for sustainability, brand differentiation, customer convenience/usability
and regulatory change. Coupled with our continued focus on streamlining our cost base and
optimizing our efficiency, we are targeting an enhanced product mix and increased profitability over
time.

   - Apply operational excellence and technical expertise. In managing our businesses, we seek to improve
our safety and efficiency, as well as controlling our costs to preserve and expand our margins. We
have consistently optimized our cost base through streamlining our manufacturing footprint and
investing in advanced technology to enhance our production capacity. We intend to continue
increasing our productivity through the deployment of leading technology across our manufacturing
footprint, including our innovation and design capabilities and development and sharing of best
practices and know-how across our operations.

**_Reasons for the Combination_**

We believe that the combination of the complementary Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal to form a
leading metal packaging provider offers attractive opportunities for future growth, as we continue to serve
our customers’ desire for high-quality, innovative and sustainable solutions in support of their brands. Our
ability to service customers across a broader range of geographies represents a significant potential benefit.
We are well positioned to pursue attractive secular growth opportunities with our well-invested asset base,
where we have spent in excess of $350 million on new production facilities since 2013.

We believe in the highly complementary fit of our businesses, with no geographic overlap in end use
categories served. Our Company has an attractive and diversified material mix, encompassing
approximately 70% tinplate steel and 30% aluminum product offerings, to deliver differentiated and
premiumized solutions to meet customer needs. Moreover, the Combination will provide for
diversification in terms of product, end market, customers and geography. Further, we continuously
support product and process innovations, as well as sustainability initiatives, with our dedicated research
and development center.

Although we operate in relatively mature industries, we have identified attractive growth
opportunities in the regions and end use categories which we serve. Overall, we believe metal packaging is
positioned to benefit from the accelerating focus on sustainability. Attractive growth opportunities include
the potential for further penetration of lighter-weight two-piece food cans in North America, increasing
demand for single-serve products in end use categories such as pet food and seafood, the shift from
tinplate steel to aluminum aerosol containers in North America, growth in aerosol markets in South
America and growth in the nutrition end use category.

We believe we have an attractive financial profile characterized by stability and underpinned by
resilient product demand, longstanding relationships with customers with whom we generally have
long-term contracts with pass-through provisions. Our well-invested asset base enjoys a low-cost profile
and, in conjunction with our relatively low level of maintenance capital expenditures, lead to a high level of
cash conversion in our business.

We also see significant scope to enhance performance through the sharing of best practices across all
aspects of our combined business. We believe that the business system approach applied by Exal in recent
years, which yielded an improvement of over 1,000 basis points in Adjusted EBITDA for the period 2015
(17.8% Adjusted EBITDA margin) to 2018 (27.9% Adjusted EBITDA margin), can deliver significant
benefits to our enlarged business over the medium term. This will involve the implementation of
commercial and operational optimization initiatives across our business, including continuous
benchmarking of process and performance, business mix enhancement, accelerating growth and innovation
opportunities, complexity reduction, a focus on value over volume and targeted investments, including in
automation to drive efficiency, quality and cost performance. We have identified commercial and
operational excellence opportunities which are expected over the next few years to generate approximately
$40 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA net benefits. We expect to realize these benefits after targeted
investments in our selling, general and administrative cost base.

**_Industry Overview_**

The global packaging industry is a large, consumer-driven industry with stable growth characteristics.
We operate in the metal container sectors and our target regions are Europe, North America and South
America. Metal containers are attractive to brand owners, as their strength and rigidity allows them to be
filled at high speeds and easily transported, while their shelf-stable nature means that refrigeration is not
required, thereby resulting in further energy savings in the supply chain. The ability to customize and
differentiate products supplied in metal containers, through innovative design, shaping and printing, also
appeals to our customers. The metal container market has been marked by progressive down-gauging,
which has generated material savings in input costs and logistics, while enhancing the consumer

experience. This reduction in raw material and energy usage in the manufacturing process has also
increased the appeal to end-users, who are increasingly focused on sustainability.

Metal can packaging is approximately a $55 billion global revenue industry that is comprised of
beverage cans (45% of the market), food (including seafood) cans (30%) and other cans (25%), according
to Smithers Pira, a leading independent market research firm.

Despite competition from other formats and materials, metal cans remain a key food packaging
format, owing to their attractive value proposition. The use of metal cans as a food packaging format is
expected to have modest but stable growth of 0.6% per annum, for the next few years, principally driven by
macroeconomic growth, as forecasted by Smithers Pira. Global sales of aerosol cans continue to increase,
driven by rising demand for beauty and personal care and household products. Growing levels of
disposable income and a focus on convenience, together with a shift in material mix from tinplate steel to
aluminum are among the factors which will drive future aerosols demand, according to Smithers Pira.
Other cans is a diverse market segment encompassing a wide variety of metal packaging containers serving
end user applications, such as nutrition, beer kegs for at-home use and paints and coatings. This market
segment benefits from multiple drivers of demand, including convenience and sustainability. Collectively,
North America, Latin America and Europe constitute 79% of the global food end use category by revenue
and 52% of the ‘‘other’’ end use category by revenue, according to Smithers Pira.

We believe the purchasing decisions of retail consumers are significantly influenced by packaging.
Consumer product manufacturers and marketers increasingly use packaging to position their products in
the market and differentiate them on retailers’ shelves. The development and production of premium,
specialized packaging products with a combination of value-added features requires a high level of design
capability, manufacturing and process know-how and quality control to consistently produce lightweight
products, with strong barrier and anti-rust properties. Additional industry trends such as SKU proliferation
and demand for convenience products, such as reclosable bottles, which are a cost-competitive alternative
to tinplate based products for smaller pack sizes, also provide opportunities for selective growth in new and
emerging end use categories.

Metal packaging offers performance and convenience for CPG companies compared to alternatives. It
acts as a superior barrier to oxygen and light and is resilient, as it can be unbreakable, tamper-proof and
fire and temperature resistant. Moreover, it is convenient, and can be lighter or more robust, with portable
characteristics and easy open and recloseable solutions. When used in the food market, metal has the
advantage of retaining nutritional value, without the requirement for preservatives. From a supply chain
perspective, metal packaging allows for efficient transportation and storage and is suited to processing on
installed high-speed filling lines and retort processes.

From a sustainability perspective, metal is the most recycled material globally and can be infinitely
recycled without any degradation in quality. Metal packaging is officially endorsed as a preferred material
by the E.U. and, with a growing awareness among end consumers of sustainability issues, has added appeal
to brand owners in helping to meet their own ambitious sustainability goals and commitments.

The metal packaging industry benefits from the stability of its end use categories, with selective
opportunities for attractive growth. Metal packaging represents a proven value proposition for CPG
companies and it is a stable technology with minimal substitution risk.

_The preliminary financial data presented in this section has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of,_
_Ardagh Carve-out Business’ and Exal’s management. Neither PricewaterhouseCoopers nor Ernst & Young LLP_
_has audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the preliminary financial data in_
_this section. Accordingly, neither PricewaterhouseCoopers nor Ernst & Young LLP expresses an opinion or any_
_other form of assurance with respect thereto._

The following comments are based on unaudited internal management estimates and are subject to
confirmation or change. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those expressed or implied. Any statements regarding past trends or activities should not be taken as
a representation that such activities or trends will continue in the future.

**_Second Quarter 2019_**

_Ardagh Carve-out Business_

We expect the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ performance in the second quarter of 2019 to be as
follows:

  - Revenue of $557 million to show a decrease of $37 million on the second quarter of 2018 (which
was $594 million). Excluding currency translation effects of $34 million, revenue decreased by
$3 million, principally due to the closure of a facility in North America in late-2018, offset by the
pass through of higher input costs.

  - Adjusted EBITDA of $85 million to show a decrease of $2 million on the second quarter of 2018
(which was $87 million). Excluding adverse currency translation effects of $5 million, Adjusted
EBITDA increased by $3 million compared to the second quarter of 2018, as favorable IFRS 16
effects were partly offset by lower volumes due to the closure of a facility in North America in
late-2018.

_Exal_

We expect Exal’s performance in the second quarter of 2019 to be as follows:

   - Revenue of approximately $75 million, which is consistent with that of the second quarter of 2018
(which was $75 million).

   - Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $21 million, which is greater than that of the second quarter of
2018 (which was $20 million), due primarily to stronger demand from key customers in South
America.

**SUMMARY COMBINED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**
**OF THE ARDAGH CARVE-OUT BUSINESS**

The following table sets forth summary financial data and other data for the Ardagh Carve-out
Business for the periods ended and as of the dates indicated below. The historical financial data presented
in the following table do not reflect changes as a result of the Transactions. The summary financial data
and other data should be read in conjunction with ‘‘Selected Combined Financial and Other Data of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business,’’ ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects of the Ardagh Carve-out
Business—Results of Operations of Ardagh Carve-out Business’’ and the financial statements and related
notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of
future expected results.

We have derived the summary financial data as of and for the financial years ended December 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016 from the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Ardagh Carve-out Business
Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements reflect the metal food and specialty business of
Ardagh Group S.A. that have not in the past formed a separate accounting group. These businesses do not
constitute a separate legal entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements have been prepared by aggregating the financial information for the metal food and specialty
business, comprising the entities constituting the Ardagh Carve-out Business together with the assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the
Ardagh Carve-out Business.

For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Ardagh Carve-out
Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, please see Note 2 ‘‘Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies’’ to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This basis of preparation sets out the
method used in identifying the financial position, performance and cash flows of the metal food and
specialty businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements. The notes explain that the businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined
Carve-out Financial Statements have not operated as a separate stand-alone entity or group.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business adopted IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019, and applied the modified
retrospective approach which does not require restatement of prior periods. As detailed in Note 2 of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business Unaudited Interim Combined Financial Statements ‘‘Summary of significant
accounting policies,’’ the adoption of IFRS 16 impacts on the combined income statement and certain key
financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges recognized in the combined income
statement. The application of the new standard decreased both cost of sales and operating costs (excluding
depreciation) in the combined income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted
EBITDA, but this is largely offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and finance expenses.

include lease liabilities recognized as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019) and other borrowings.

(5) Adjusted EBITDA consists of profit before tax, net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional operating
items. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin are presented because we believe that they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other
interested parties in evaluating companies in the packaging industry. However, other companies may calculate Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in a manner different from ours. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to profit/(loss) as
indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

The reconciliation of profit before tax to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

and excludes unamortized deferred financing fees and lease obligations.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income, plus the following items: income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and
amortization, certain one-time or unusual items such as costs associated with the recovery from the Exal Packaging facility fire,
impairment of property, plant, and equipment, South American financial taxes, management change costs, restructuring
expenses including severance and expenses associated other special projects. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe
that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating companies in the packaging
industry. However, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in a manner different from ours. Adjusted EBITDA is
not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to profit/(loss) as
indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(5) Capital expenditures is the sum of purchase of property, plant and equipment and software and other intangibles.

(1) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is defined by us as pro forma profit for the period before income tax expense/(credit), net finance
expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional operating items. Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA is
defined by us as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for: 1) the impact of new accounting standards with respect to
leasing and 2) the impact of cost saving initiatives arising as a result of planned optimization, reorganization and operational
improvement initiatives. We present Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA because
they are measures management uses to assess financial performance. We believe that Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA provide investors with alternative methods for assessing our operating results in a
manner that enables them to more thoroughly evaluate our performance. These non-GAAP measures also provide a baseline
for assessing our future results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to give investors access to the types of measures that
we use in analyzing our results. While providing useful information, measures of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flow from operating
activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to profit/(loss) on ordinary activities as indicators of operating
performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA may have material limitations as performance measures because they exclude items
that are necessary elements of our costs and operations. In addition, ‘‘Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA’’ or ‘‘Pro Forma
Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA’’ presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each
company may define these terms differently.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks,_
_together with other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to invest in_
_the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could materially adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition or results of operations. If these events occur, the trading prices of the Notes could decline,_
_and we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part_
_of your investment. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm_
_us and affect your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our_
_actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that_
_might cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See_
_‘‘Forward-Looking Statements.’’_

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

**_Our customers sell to consumers of food, seafood, pet food and nutrition, as well as beauty and personal care and_**
**_premium beverages. If economic conditions affect consumer demand, our customers may be affected, thus reducing_**
**_the demand for our products._**

Demand for our packaging depends on demand for the products which use our packaging, which is
primarily consumer driven. General economic conditions may adversely impact consumer confidence,
resulting in reduced spending on our customers’ products and, thereby, reduced or postponed demand for
our products.

Adverse economic conditions may also lead to more limited availability of credit, which may have a
negative impact on the financial condition, particularly on the purchasing ability, of some of our customers
and distributors and may also result in requests for extended payment terms, and result in credit losses,
insolvencies and diminished sales channels available to us. Our suppliers may have difficulties obtaining
necessary credit, which could jeopardize their ability to provide timely deliveries of raw materials and other
essentials to us. Adverse economic conditions may also lead to suppliers requesting credit support or
otherwise reducing credit, which may have a negative effect on our cash flows and working capital.

Volatility in exchange rates may also increase the costs of our products that we may not be able to pass
on to our customers; impair the purchasing power of our customers in different markets; result in
significant competitive benefit to certain of our competitors who incur a material part of their costs in
other currencies than we do; hamper our pricing; and increase our hedging costs and limit our ability to
hedge our exchange rate exposure.

Changes in global economic conditions may reduce our ability to forecast developments in our
industry and plan our operations and costs, resulting in operational inefficiencies. Negative developments
in our business, results of operations and financial condition due to changes in global economic conditions
or other factors could cause ratings agencies to lower the credit ratings, or ratings outlook, of our shortand long-term debt and, consequently, impair our ability to raise new financing or refinance our current
borrowings and increase our costs of issuing any new debt instruments.

Furthermore, the economic outlook could be adversely affected by the risk that one or more eurozone
countries could leave the European Monetary Union, or the euro as the single currency of the eurozone
could cease to exist. Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are
likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the economic development of the affected countries
and could lead to severe economic recession or depression, and a general anticipation that such risks will
materialize in the future could jeopardize the stability of financial markets or the overall financial and
monetary system. This, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
liquidity and results of operations.

**_We face intense competition from other metal packaging producers, as well as from manufacturers of alternative_**
**_forms of packaging._**

The metal packaging sectors in which we operate are mature, experiencing limited growth in demand
in recent years and competitive. Competition in the market for customized, differentiated packaging is
based on price and, increasingly, on innovation, design, quality and service. The most competitive aspect of
the metal packaging market is the sale of undifferentiated, standardized food cans. Prices for these
products are primarily driven by raw material costs and seasonal capacity. Our principal competitors
include Crown Holdings, Silgan Holdings, Ball Metalpack, Ball Corporation, CCL Container, TUBEX
Group and Moravia Cans. To the extent that any one or more of our competitors become more successful
with respect to any key competitive factor, our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially
and adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are subject to substantial competition from producers of packaging made from plastic, carton and
composites, particularly from producers of plastic packaging and flexible packaging. Changes in consumer
preferences in terms of food processing (e.g., fresh or frozen food content and dry versus wet pet food) or
in terms of packaging materials, style and product presentation can significantly influence sales. An
increase in our costs of production or a decrease in the costs of, or a further increase in consumer demand
for, alternative packaging could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_We may not realize the growth opportunities, cost savings and synergies that are anticipated from the continuous_**
**_improvement efforts that we undertake._**

We may not realize all of the cost savings and synergies we expect to achieve from our current
operational improvement initiatives due to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, our ability to
reduce headcount, eliminate duplicative overhead and functions, difficulties in rationalizing manufacturing
capacity and integrating shared services within our business, higher than expected employee severance or
retention costs, higher than expected overhead expenses and expenses related to facilities closures, delays
in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings plans and other unexpected costs
associated with operating our business. If we are unable to achieve the cost savings or commercial
synergies that we expect to achieve from our operational improvement initiatives, or if the implementation
of these initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost more or take longer to effectuate than we expect,
it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our profitability could be affected by varied seasonal demands._**

Demand for some of our products is seasonal. The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ sales are typically
greater in the second and third quarters of the year, with generally lower sales in the first and fourth
quarters. Exal typically has it lowest sales in the third quarter. Weather conditions can reduce crop yields
and adversely affect customer demand for fruit and vegetable cans. Demand for our seafood packaging is
also affected by variations in local fish catches. The variable nature of the food and seafood packaging
businesses and our vulnerability to natural conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_An increase in metal packaging and aerosol container manufacturing capacity without a corresponding increase in_**
**_demand for metal packaging could cause prices to decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations._**

The profitability of metal packaging companies is heavily influenced by the supply of, and demand for,
metal packaging.

We cannot assure you that metal packaging and aerosol container manufacturing capacity in any of
our markets will not increase further in the future, nor can we assure you that demand for metal packaging

30


-----

will meet or exceed supply. If metal packaging and aerosol container manufacturing capacity increases and
there is no corresponding increase in demand, the prices we receive for our products could materially
decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Because our customers are concentrated, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to maintain_**
**_relationships with our largest customers._**

For the year ended December 31, 2018, Ardagh Carve-out Business’ ten largest customers accounted
for approximately 39% of its revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Exal’s ten largest customers
accounted for approximately 78% of its consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018,
Trivium’s ten largest customers would have accounted for approximately 39% of its consolidated revenues.

We believe our relationships with these customers are good, but there can be no assurance that we will
be able to maintain these relationships. For Trivium, approximately 60% of revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2018, were under multiyear supply agreements of varying terms, with the remaining
revenues generally under one-year agreements. Although these arrangements have provided, and we
expect they will continue to provide, the basis for long-term partnerships with our customers, there can be
no assurance that our customers will not cease purchasing our products. If our customers unexpectedly
reduce the amount of metal cans they purchase from us, or cease purchasing metal cans altogether, our
revenues could decrease and our inventory levels could increase, both of which could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, while we believe that the
arrangements that we have with our customers will be renewed, there can be no assurance that such
arrangements will be renewed upon their expiration or that the terms of any renewal will be as favorable to
us as the terms of the current arrangements. There is also the risk that our customers may shift their filling
operations to locations in which we do not operate. The loss of one or more of these customers, a
significant reduction in sales to these customers or a significant change in the commercial terms of our
relationship with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_The continuing consolidation of our customer base may intensify pricing pressures or result in the loss of customers,_**
**_either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Some of our largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines.
For example, in 2017, Reckitt Benckiser merged with Mead Johnson Nutrition Company. Such
consolidation has increased the concentration of our net sales with our largest customers and may continue
in the future. In many cases, such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower
prices. Increased pricing pressures from our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, this consolidation may lead manufacturers to rely
on a reduced number of suppliers. If, following the consolidation of one of our customers with another
company, a competitor was to be the main supplier to the consolidated companies, this could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Changes in consumer lifestyle, nutritional preferences, health-related concerns and consumer taxation could_**
**_adversely affect our business._**

Changes in consumer preferences and tastes can have an impact on demand for our customers’
products, which in turn can lead to reduced demand for our products.

Certain end products represent a significant proportion of our packaging market. In the past, the
occurrence of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and swine fever have sometimes led to
reduced demand for associated canned products, such as sauces, soups and ready meals, and publicity
about the supposed carcinogenic effect of coatings used on some cans may have affected sales of canned
products.

31


-----

Any decline in the popularity of these product types as a result of lifestyle, nutrition, health
considerations or consumer taxation could have a significant impact on our customers and could have a
material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our profitability could be affected by the availability and cost of raw materials, including as a result of changes in_**
**_tariffs and duties._**

The raw materials that we use have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple
sources. For certain raw materials, however, there may be temporary shortages due to weather,
transportation, production delays or other factors. In such an event, no assurance can be given that we
would be able to secure our raw materials from sources other than our current suppliers on terms as
favorable as our current terms, or at all. Any such raw materials shortages or any material increases in the
cost of any of the principal raw materials that we use, including the introduction of new tariffs, could also
inhibit our ability to secure necessary raw materials. For example, in 2018, tariffs of 25% on steel and 10%
on aluminum were introduced in the United States. These tariffs were initially imposed by the United
States on all countries, but as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no longer apply to such imports
from Canada and most such imports from Mexico, though new tariffs have been applied to certain
fabricated steel imports from Mexico. Further tariffs, duties or other increases in the cost to transport
materials to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations or those of our customers. Furthermore, the relative price of oil and its
by-products may impact our business by affecting transport, lacquer and ink costs.

The primary raw materials that we use are steel (both in tinplate and tin-free forms) and aluminum.
Steel is generally purchased under one-year contracts with prices that are usually fixed in advance. When
such contracts are renewed in the future, our steel costs under such contracts will be subject to prevailing
global steel prices at the time of renewal, which may be different from historical prices. The hedging
market for steel, and in particular that for coking coal, is a new market with limited depth and, as a
consequence, there might be limitations on our ability to hedge steel input prices.

In the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ European operations, aluminum is generally purchased under
three-year contracts. In contrast, Exal typically purchases aluminum at spot market index rates. Aluminum
ingot is traded daily as a commodity on the London Metal Exchange, which has historically been subject to
significant price volatility. Because aluminum is priced in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/euro
rate also affect the euro cost of aluminum ingot. In contrast to steel, the hedging market for aluminum is
well-developed and its depth does not pose a limitation on the ability to place hedges in the market. The
Ardagh Carve-out Business has historically hedged its aluminum exposure, while Exal has not. We expect
this trend to continue for our operations going forward, due to the pricing preferences of our customers.
Our business is exposed to both the availability of aluminum and the volatility of aluminum prices,
including associated premiums. While raw materials are generally available from independent suppliers,
raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors,
including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (with respect to aluminum on the
London Metal Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability
of complementary and substitute materials. Adverse economic or financial changes could impact our
suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages or increasing costs for our business.

While the majority of our sales to customers are made via sales contracts which include provisions
enabling us to pass-through increases in certain input costs, we may not be able to pass on all or
substantially all raw material price increases, now or in the future. In addition, we may not be able to hedge
successfully against raw material cost increases. Furthermore, steel and aluminum prices are subject to
considerable volatility in price and demand. While in the past sufficient quantities of steel and aluminum
have been generally available for purchase, these quantities may not be available in the future, and, even if
available, we may not be able to continue to purchase them at current prices. Further increases in the cost
of these raw materials could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows.

32


-----

The supplier industries from which we receive our raw materials are relatively concentrated, and this
concentration can impact raw material costs. Over the last ten years, the number of major steel and
aluminum suppliers has decreased and further consolidation could hinder our ability to obtain adequate
supplies of these raw materials, potentially leading to higher prices for steel and aluminum.

The failure to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials or future price increases could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Currency, interest rate fluctuations and commodity prices may have a material impact on our business._**

Currently, our functional currency is anticipated to be the euro and we will present our financial
information in U.S. dollars. Insofar as possible, we will actively manage currency exposures through the
deployment of assets and liabilities throughout the Group and, when necessary and economically justified,
enter into currency hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by
hedging against rate changes with respect to our anticipated functional currency, the euro. However, we
may not be successful in limiting such exposure, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, our presented results may be impacted as a result of
fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the euro.

We have production facilities in 21 different countries worldwide. We also sell products to, and obtain
raw materials from, companies located in these and different regions and countries globally. As a
consequence, a significant portion of our consolidated revenue, costs, assets and liabilities are
denominated in currencies other than the euro, particularly the U.S. dollar, the pound, the Brazilian real
and the Argentine peso. The exchange rates between the currencies which we are exposed to, such as the
euro, the U.S. dollar, the pound, the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso, have fluctuated significantly in
the past and may continue to do so in the future.

In our European operations, we incur currency transaction risks primarily on metal purchases (or the
hedging of those purchases), as metal prices are denominated in U.S. dollars, and on revenue denominated
in currencies other than the euro supplied from facilities in euro-participant territories (or the hedging of
those sales).

In addition to currency transaction risk, we are subject to currency translation risk. Our policy is,
where practical, to match net investments in foreign currencies with borrowings in the same currency. The
debt and interest payments relating to our Danish and Polish operations are all denominated in euro.
Fluctuations in the value of these currencies with respect to the euro may have a significant impact on our
financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in exchange rates can affect our ability to purchase raw materials and sell products at
profitable prices, reduce the value of our assets and revenues, and increase liabilities and costs.

We are also exposed to interest rate risk. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect our interest expense
on the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes and the cost of new financing. We
use cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage this risk, but sustained increases in interest rates could
nevertheless materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For a further discussion of these matters and the measures we have taken to seek to protect our
business against these risks, see ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects of the Ardagh Carve-out
Business—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk’’ and ‘‘Operating and Financial
Review and Prospects of Exal—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.’’

**_Our ability to fully pass through input costs may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

The majority of our sales to customers are made via sales contracts which include provisions enabling
us to pass-through increases in certain input costs, generally for steel or aluminum, which help us reduce
margin volatility due to changes in raw material costs, and in certain instances for conversion costs such as
energy and labor. However, there is no assurance that we will be in a position to fully recover increased
input costs from all of our customers.

**_Our manufacturing facilities are subject to operating hazards._**

Our manufacturing processes include cutting, extruding, coating and shaping metal into containers, as
well as the conversion of molten aluminum into aluminum slugs at high temperatures. These processes,
which are conducted at high speeds and involve operating heavy machinery and equipment, entail risks and
hazards, including industrial accidents, leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires, mechanical failures and
environmental hazards, such as spills, storage tank leaks, discharges or releases toxic or hazardous
substances and gases. These hazards may cause unplanned business interruptions, unscheduled downtime,
transportation interruptions, personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or the destruction of
property and equipment, environmental contamination and other environmental damage, civil, criminal
and administrative sanctions and liabilities and third-party claims, any of which may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in October 2017
Exal’s Exal Packaging business experienced a fire.

**_Our business requires ongoing capital expenditures, which we may be unable to fund._**

Our business requires ongoing capital expenditures. We may not be able to make such capital
expenditures if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, have funds available for borrowing
under our ABL Facility to cover these capital expenditure requirements or if we were restricted from
incurring additional debt to cover such expenditures or as a result of a combination of these factors. If we
are unable to meet our capital expenditure plans, we may not be able to maintain our manufacturing
capacity, which may negatively impact our competitive position and, ultimately, our revenues and
profitability.

**_Interrupted energy supplies and higher energy costs may have a material adverse effect on our business._**

We use natural gas and electrical power to manufacture our products. These energy sources are vital
to our operations and we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our business. Energy prices are
subject to considerable volatility. We are not able to predict to what extent energy prices will vary in the
future. If energy costs increase in the future, we could experience a sizeable increase in operating costs,
which could, if we are not able to recover these costs increases from our customers through selling price
increases, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to various environmental and other legal requirements and may be subject to new requirements of this_**
**_kind in the future that could impose substantial costs upon us._**

Our operations and properties are subject to extensive laws, ordinances, regulations and other legal
requirements relating to environmental protection. Such laws and regulations which may affect our
operations include, among others, requirements regarding remediation of contaminated soil, groundwater
and buildings, water supply and use, natural resources, water discharges, air emissions, waste management,
noise pollution, asbestos and other deleterious materials, the generation, storage, handling, transportation
and disposal of regulated materials, product safety and workplace health and safety. Such laws and
regulations are also subject to constant review by lawmakers and regulators which may result in further
environmental legal requirements.

34


-----

We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with such legal requirements, and
these costs are likely to increase in the future. Inquiries and enforcement by other regulators, including
demands for more stringent pollution control devices could also result in the need for further capital
upgrades to our furnaces and plant operations at substantial cost. We require a variety of permits to
conduct our operations, including operating permits such as those required under various U.S. laws,
including the federal Clean Air Act and the E.U. Industrial Emissions Directive, water and trade effluent
discharge permits, water abstraction permits and waste permits. We are in the process of applying for, or
renewing, permits at a number of our sites. Failure to obtain and maintain the relevant permits, as well as
noncompliance with such permits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

If we were to violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations or our permits, we could be
subject to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions and liabilities, including substantial fines and orders,
or a partial or total shutdown of our operations.

In order to comply with air emission restrictions, significant capital investments may be necessary at
some sites. Our business is also affected by the E.U. ETS, which limits emissions of greenhouse gases. See
‘‘The Trivium Business—Environmental, Health and Safety and Product Safety Regulation.’’ This scheme,
any future changes to it and any additional measures required to control the emission of greenhouse gases
that may apply to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Changes to the laws and regulations governing the materials that are used in our manufacturing
operations may impact the price of such materials or result in such materials no longer being available,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The E.U. passed regulations concerning REACH, which place onerous obligations on the manufacturers
and importers of substances, preparations and articles containing substances, and which may have a
material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, substances we use may have to be removed from the
market (under REACH’s authorization and restriction provisions) or need to be substituted for alternative
chemicals which may also adversely impact upon our operations.

Sites at which we operate often have a long history of industrial activities and may be, or have been in
the past, engaged in activities involving the use of materials and processes that could give rise to
contamination and result in potential liability to investigate or remediate, as well as claims for alleged
damage to persons, property or natural resources. Liability may be imposed on us as owners, occupiers or
operators of contaminated facilities. These legal requirements may apply to contamination at sites that we
currently or formerly owned, occupied or operated, or that were formerly, owned, occupied or operated by
companies we acquired or at sites where we have sent waste offsite for treatment or disposal. Our closure
of a site may accelerate the need to investigate and remediate any contamination at the site.

**_Changes in product requirements and their enforcement may have a material impact on our operations._**

Changes in laws and regulations relating to deposits on, and the recycling of, metal packaging could
adversely affect our business if implemented on a large scale in the major markets in which we operate.
Changes in laws and regulations laying down restrictions on, and conditions for use of, food contact
materials or on the use of materials and agents in the production of our products could likewise adversely
affect our business. Changes to health and food safety regulations could increase costs and also might have
a material adverse effect on revenues if, as a result, the public attitude toward end products, for which we
provide packaging, were substantially affected.

Additionally, the effectiveness of new standards such as the ones related to recycling or deposits on
different packaging materials could result in excess costs or logistical constraints for some of our customers
who could choose to reduce their consumption and even terminate the use of metal packaging for their

35


-----

products. We could thus be forced to reduce, suspend or even stop the production of certain types of
products.

Environmental concerns could lead E.U. or U.S. bodies to implement other product regulations that
are likely to be restrictive for us and have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. There is significant variation, among countries where we sell our products, in the
limitation on certain constituents in packaging, which can have the effect of restricting the types of raw
materials we use. In turn, these restrictions can increase our operating costs, such as increased energy
consumption, and the environmental impacts of our operations.

Other changes, such as restrictions on BPA in coatings for some of our products, as well as on the
usage of chromium VI in consumer products and industrial processes, which have been proposed or
adopted in the E.U. under the REACH legislation and some of its member states, have required us to
develop substitute materials for our production.

**_We could incur significant costs in relation to claims of injury and illness resulting from materials present or used at_**
**_our production sites, or from our use of these sites or other workplace injuries, or from our products._**

As is the case in a number of other industrial processes that deal with high temperatures, since the
1990s, items made of asbestos have gradually been removed from our sites in Western Europe and the
United States. Because of the age of some of our sites, however, asbestos-cement may have been used in
construction and may still be present at these sites. When these buildings are modernized or repaired, the
cost of upgrades is higher because of the restrictions associated with removing asbestos-containing
materials.

We are exposed to claims alleging injury or illness associated with asbestos and related compensation
over and above the support that may be offered through various existing social security systems in
countries where we operate.

We are also exposed to claims alleging musculoskeletal disorders caused by performing certain
repetitive operations or motions. We could also face claims alleging illness or injury from use of the
products that we manufacture or sell or from workplace injuries more generally. If these claims succeed,
they could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations and other proceedings that could have an adverse effect on_**
**_us._**

We are currently involved in various litigation matters, and we anticipate that we will be involved in
litigation matters from time to time in the future. The risks inherent in our business expose us to litigation,
including personal injury, environmental litigation, litigation with contractual counterparties, intellectual
property litigation, tax or securities litigation and product liability lawsuits. We cannot predict with
certainty the outcome or effect of any claim, regulatory investigation or other litigation matter, or a
combination of these. If we are involved in any future litigation, or if our positions concerning current
disputes are found to be incorrect, this may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations, because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with asserting our claims
or defending such lawsuits, and the diversion of management’s attention to these matters. See ‘‘The
Trivium Business—Legal Proceedings.’’

**_We could incur significant costs due to the location of some of our industrial sites close to urban areas._**

Obtaining, renewing or maintaining permits and authorizations issued by administrative authorities
necessary to operate our production plants could be made more difficult due to the increasing urbanization
of the sites where some of our manufacturing plants are located. Some of our sites are located close to
urban areas. Urbanization could lead to more stringent operating conditions (by imposing traffic

36


-----

restrictions, for example), conditions for obtaining or renewing the necessary authorizations, the refusal to
grant or renew these authorizations or expropriations of these sites in order to allow urban planning
projects to proceed.

The occurrence of such events could result in us incurring significant costs and there can be no
assurance that the occurrence of such events would entitle us to partial or full compensation.

**_We may incur unforeseen risks and costs relating to acquisitions._**

We may acquire other businesses from time to time. Risks associated with acquisitions include, for
example, that our assessment of the acquisition target proves to be incorrect; we may become exposed to
legal, market or other risks associated with the new business; there may be difficulties in conforming the
acquired company’s information systems, accounting, books and records, procedures and policies to ours
and it may prove difficult to retain the loyalty and business of the customers of the acquired business. Any
failure by us to successfully integrate an acquired business may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We face costs associated with our post-retirement and post-employment obligations to employees which could have_**
**_an adverse effect on our financial condition._**

As of March 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis, our accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
approximately $312 million. The additional costs associated with these and other benefits to employees
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, these
obligations may rank senior to the Guarantees of the Notes in a bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor as a
matter of law.

We operate a number of pension and other post-retirement benefit schemes funded by a range of
assets which may include property, derivatives, equities and/or bonds. The value of these assets is heavily
dependent on the performance of markets which are subject to volatility. The liability structure of the
obligations to provide such benefits is also subject to market volatility in relation to its accounting
valuation and management. Additional significant funding of our pension and other post-retirement
benefit obligations may be required if market underperformance is severe.

**_Organized strikes or work stoppages by unionized employees could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Many of our operating companies are party to collective bargaining agreements with trade unions.
These agreements cover the majority of our employees. Upon the expiration of any collective bargaining
agreement, our operating companies’ inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with trade unions could
result in strikes by the affected workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or
benefits paid to union members. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work
stoppage, we could experience a significant disruption of operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs,
which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Failure of control measures and systems resulting in faulty or contaminated product could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business._**

We have strict control measures and systems in place to ensure that the maximum safety and quality of
our products is maintained. The consequences of a product not meeting these rigorous standards, due to,
among other things, accidental or malicious raw materials contamination or due to supply chain
contamination caused by human error or equipment fault, could be severe. Such consequences might
include adverse effects on consumer health, litigation exposures, loss of market share, financial costs and
loss of revenues.

37


-----

In addition, if our products fail to meet rigorous standards, we may be required to incur substantial
costs in taking appropriate corrective action (up to and including recalling products from consumers) and
to reimburse customers and/or end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of this failure.
Customers and end consumers may seek to recover these losses through litigation and, under applicable
legal rules, may succeed in any such claim, despite there being no negligence or other fault on our part.
Placing an unsafe product on the market, failing to notify the regulatory authorities of a safety issue, failing
to take appropriate corrective action and failing to meet other regulatory requirements relating to product
safety could lead to regulatory investigation, enforcement action and/or prosecution. Any product quality
or safety issue may also result in adverse publicity, which may damage our reputation. This could in turn
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we
have not had material claims for damages for defective products in the past, and have not conducted any
substantial product recalls or other material corrective action, these events may occur in the future.

In certain contracts, we provide warranties in respect of the proper functioning of our products and
the conformity of a product to the specific use defined by the customer.

In addition, if a product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated, it is
possible that the manufacturer of the product may allege that our packaging is the cause of the fault or
contamination, even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications.

In case of the failure of packaging produced by us to open properly or to preserve the integrity of its
contents, we could face liability to our customers and to third parties for bodily injury or other tangible or
intangible damages suffered as a result. Such liability, if it were to be established in relation to a sufficient
volume of claims or to claims for sufficiently large amounts, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may be insufficient and future coverage may be difficult or expensive to obtain._**

Although we believe that our insurance policies will provide adequate coverage for the risks inherent
in our business, these insurance policies typically exclude certain risks and are subject to certain thresholds
and limits. We cannot assure you that our property, plant and equipment and inventories will not suffer
damages due to unforeseen events or that the proceeds available from our insurance policies will be
sufficient to protect us from all possible loss or damage resulting from such events. As a result, our
insurance coverage may prove to be inadequate for events that may cause significant disruption to our
operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We may suffer indirect losses, such as the disruption of our business or third-party claims of damages,
as a result of an insured risk event. While we shall carry business interruption insurance and general
liability insurance, they will be subject to certain limitations, thresholds and limits and may not fully cover
all indirect losses.

We anticipate renewal of our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may increase
to an extent that we may choose to reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our
coverage. Among other factors, adverse political developments, security concerns and natural disasters in
any country in which we operate may materially adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in
increased premiums for available coverage and additional exclusions from coverage.

**_Our food packaging sales could be adversely affected by changes in agricultural subsidy rules._**

Certain subsidies are provided to agricultural producers for the production of various fruit, vegetable
and dairy products. For example, E.U. rules provide for such subsidies. The availability of these subsidies
may affect levels of production for certain agricultural products. Any reduction in existing subsidy levels

38


-----

could lead to a reduction in harvest or canning operations and therefore could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our business may suffer if we do not retain our executive and senior management._**

We depend on our executive team, who are identified under ‘‘Board of Directors and Senior
Management’’ of this Offering Memorandum. The loss of services of any of the members of our executive
team or other members of senior management could adversely affect our business until a suitable
replacement can be found. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in
these positions and there is no assurance that we would be able to locate or employ such qualified
personnel on terms acceptable to us or at all.

**_The United Kingdom’s notice of its intention to withdraw from the E.U. may have a negative effect on our financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom gave notice to the E.U. under Article 50 of the Treaty of
European Union of its decision to withdraw from the E.U (‘‘Brexit’’). Currently, the United Kingdom is
due to leave the E.U. on October 31, 2019.

In November 2018, the United Kingdom and the E.U. agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement
setting out the terms of the United Kingdom’s departure. This agreement included a two-year transition
period, during which the E.U. would treat the United Kingdom as if it were still a member of the E.U. This
was included to facilitate the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the E.U. and to provide
additional legal certainty once E.U. law ceases to apply to the United Kingdom. However, this agreement
was subsequently rejected by the U.K. Parliament several times. On April 11, 2019, the European Council
granted an extension of the notice period under Article 50 to October 31, 2019. Discussions regarding the
terms of the United Kingdom’s exit are therefore ongoing. Nevertheless, if the U.K. Parliament does not
approve a withdrawal deal before October 31, 2019, then (subject to any further extension of the
negotiation period being agreed to by the United Kingdom and a unanimous decision of the European
Council or the United Kingdom revoking Brexit altogether), the United Kingdom will leave the E.U.
without a deal on that date. In such a scenario, the United Kingdom will, subject to any unilateral
exemptions or bilateral topic-by-topic deals, lose the trade agreements it has in place with other countries
as a member of the E.U. and trade with both the E.U. and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs
and duties based on World Trade Organization terms. Additionally, the movement of goods between the
United Kingdom and the remaining member states of the E.U. could be subject to additional inspections
and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. These changes to the
trading relationship between the United Kingdom and E.U. could result in increased cost of goods
imported into and exported from the United Kingdom. Ongoing uncertainty on whether the government
and U.K. parliament of the United Kingdom and the E.U. will agree to a revised withdrawal agreement
sustains the possibility that the United Kingdom will leave the E.U. without a withdrawal agreement and
transition period in place. Moreover, on May 24, 2019, Theresa May announced her resignation as Prime
Minister, leading the way to the future election of a new leader for the Conservative party who is currently
expected to become Prime Minister on July 24, 2019, thus adding increased uncertainty to the U.K.’s
domestic political situation.

Approximately 8% of Trivium’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, would have been
derived from revenues generated in the United Kingdom. Any changes to the trading relationship between
the United Kingdom and the E.U. may adversely affect the cost or timing of imports, including aluminum
and coatings in our operations. Further, while we predominantly sell to customers in the local U.K. market,
some of our customers based in the U.K. who export outside the local U.K. market may experience
reduced demand and/or delays arising from Brexit and post-Brexit arrangements. These negative impacts
could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, because of the extent
of our business in the United Kingdom, the precise impact of Brexit is difficult to predict and may include

39


-----

effects beyond those described herein, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Further, political instability as a result of Brexit may result in a material negative effect on credit
markets and foreign direct investments in Europe and the United Kingdom. Uncertainty related to Brexit
has also resulted in exchange rate volatility between the British pound and other currencies. See also our
risk factor under ‘‘Risks Relating to Our Business’’ entitled ‘‘Currency, interest rate fluctuations and
commodity prices may have a material impact on our business.’’ This deterioration in economic conditions
could result in increased unemployment rates, increased short- and long-term interest rates, consumer and
commercial bankruptcy filings, a decline in the strength of national and local economies, and other results
that negatively impact household incomes.

The economic outlook could be further adversely affected by the risk that one or more E.U. member
states could leave the E.U. as well, the risk of a greater push for independence by Scotland or Northern
Ireland. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse
effect on the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and
restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations,
currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. These
negative impacts could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in many different countries._**

Our facilities are located in Europe, Morocco, the Seychelles, South Korea, the United States,
Canada, Argentina and Brazil. Risks inherent in international operations include the following:

   - economic contraction or volatility;

   - general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which we operate;

   - outbreaks of war, rebellion, terrorism or other acts of violence;

   - the nationalization or expropriation of privately-owned assets, or other political interference;

   - the introduction or tightening of foreign ownership restrictions;

   - the cancellation or unenforceability of contractual rights or title to real property;

   - compliance with a variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions may be burdensome;

   - inconsistent regulations, licensing and legal requirements may increase our cost of operations as we
endeavor to comply with a myriad of laws that differ from one country to another in an
unpredictable and adverse manner;

   - withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income could be imposed or other restrictions
on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, could be adopted;

   - adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses
could occur;

  - changes in trade laws, sanctions or embargos;

   - difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights;

   - increase in transportation and other shipping costs;

   - staffing difficulties, national or regional labor strikes or other labor disputes;

   - changes in local legal or regulatory requirements, or their interpretation, in the operation of our
business, including environmental rules, contracting or bidding requirements, local content

40


-----

requirements, or various other areas of labor (such as the availability of work permits), and contract
or natural resource law;

  - differences in consumer preferences in products;

   - currency collapse, devaluation, volatility or appreciation and the introduction of price controls; and

   - difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables.

Any negative change in one or more macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, inflation, wage
levels, unemployment, foreign investment and international trade, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects.

**_Increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect our business._**

We will continue our efforts to meet data security obligations and must manage evolving cybersecurity
threats. The loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, employees’ or business partners’
information, or our failure to meet our obligations, could result in lost revenue, increased costs, legal
claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. A significant data breach or our failure to meet our
obligations may adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.

**_Our heavy reliance on technology and automated systems to operate its business could mean any significant failure_**
**_or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business._**

We depend on automated systems and technology to operate its business, including accounting
systems, manufacturing systems and telecommunication systems. We operate a cyber and information risk
management program including operating a global information security function, which partners with
global leaders in the security industry, to deliver an integrated information and cyber risk management
service using state-of-the-art technologies in areas including antivirus and anti-malware, email and web
security platforms, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, cyber threat intelligence services and advanced
persistent threat detection. We also partner with global leaders to deliver high availability and resilient
systems and communication platforms. However, there is the possibility that these systems could suffer
substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events, some of which are beyond our control, including
natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment or software failures, computer viruses or
cyber security attacks. Substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions, could result in the
unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, result in increased costs, lost
revenue and the loss or compromise of important data, and may adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**Risks Relating to the Combination**

**_The Combination is subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals._**

Before the Combination may be consummated, approvals or consents must be obtained from
regulatory authorities (or waiting periods must expire or terminate) under applicable antitrust and
competition laws in various jurisdictions, including the European Union, the United States, Brazil and
Ukraine. There can be no assurance that all of these required approvals or consents will be obtained (or
waiting periods will expire or terminate) on a timely basis.

**_The Combination is subject to successful completion of required works council consultations._**

Completion of the Combination is subject to completion of consultations with the Ardagh Carve-out
Business’ works councils in France and the Netherlands. The works councils have a right of consultation on
proposed material actions of certain legal entities within the Ardagh Carve-out Business, including certain
Post-Completion Date Guarantors, such as contemplated acquisitions, dispositions, financing

41


-----

arrangements (including the granting of guarantees or security), joint ventures and dismissals and
appointments of directors. In addition, works councils have a right of approval on employment-related and
labor-related matters. As a result, the Ardagh Group will need to complete the consultation processes in
France and the Netherlands in respect of the Transactions prior to the completion of the Combination.
The satisfactory completion of these consultations, and the consummation of the Combination, may not
occur in a timely manner or at all. Please see ‘‘The Combination—Transactions Agreement.’’

**_If the Combination is not completed, you may not obtain the return that you expect on the Notes._**

Upon the issue of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers will deposit gross proceeds from the offering into
one or more Escrow Accounts to be held in escrow pending the satisfaction of certain conditions
precedent, including the completion of the Combination, the receipt of required regulatory approvals (or
the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods) in Europe, the United States, Brazil and
Ukraine, and the completion of required works council consultations in France and the Netherlands. If the
Combination has not been consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date or, upon the occurrence of certain
events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. If this occurs, you may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition,
the escrowed funds will only be in the amount of the gross proceeds received from the offering of the
Notes, and will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption amount, which includes accrued
and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

In addition, the cash and property held in the Escrow Accounts may be invested in certain permitted
investments, including in commercial paper, long-term and short-term debt obligations, and money market
funds, _provided that such investment is rated: (i) in the case of long-term debt obligations, at least_
(a) ‘‘AAA’’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (‘‘S&P’’), (b) ‘‘Aaa’’ by Moody’s Investors Service Inc.
(‘‘Moody’s’’) or (c) ‘‘AAA’’ by Fitch Ratings Limited (‘‘Fitch’’); (ii) in the case of commercial paper and
short-term debt obligations, at least (a) ‘‘A-1+’’ by S&P, (b) ‘‘P-1’’ by Moody’s or (c) ‘‘F1+’’ by Fitch; or
(iii) in the case of any money market funds, rated at least (a) ‘‘AAA’’ or ‘‘AAAm-G’’ by S&P or (b) ‘‘Aaa/
MR1+’’ by Moody’s. However, despite the rating requirement, there are certain risks that may occur as a
result of these permitted investments, which may lead to a diminished or total loss of returns on such
investments, none of which are under the Issuer’s control. These include risks relating to indices, interest
rates and other market risks as they apply to the particular investments. In addition, the counterparty
which provided the investment may face financial difficulties, and if they are not able to redeem the
investment in full, this may lead to a shortfall in such Escrow Accounts. Further, if the Escrow Agent or
any of the securities depositaries it transacts with face operational or financial difficulties, the same risks
may occur. Further, depending on the investment, the Escrow Agent may not be able to liquidate the
investment promptly if it becomes illiquid or has a specific maturity. This may lead to delays in obtaining a
cash return on the amounts in such Escrow Account, which would be required to return cash to holders of
the Notes, or may lead to losses if the risks above apply to such investments.

There can be no assurance that the investment policy relating to the permitted investments or other
risks mentioned above will not cause a shortfall in cash to enable the Issuer to fund the special mandatory
redemption in the manner as described in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.’’

Although the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, will be granted first-priority liens on
the applicable funds in the escrow accounts, the ability of holders of the Notes to realize such funds may be
subject to certain bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of
the Issuer. If the Issuer commences a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, or one is commenced against
the Issuer while amounts remain in the escrow accounts, applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws may

42


-----

prevent the Escrow Agent from releasing the escrowed funds or applying those funds for the benefit of the
holders of the Notes. The court adjudicating that case might find that such escrow accounts are the
property of the bankrupt or insolvent estate. As a result, holders of the Notes may not be able to have the
escrow funds applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the indentures governing the Notes
and could suffer a loss as a result.

**_We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Combination._**

We may not be able to achieve the combination benefits or other synergies we anticipate in connection
with the Combination. Joint ventures inherently involve risks, including those associated with assimilating
and integrating different business operations, corporate cultures and governance, personnel, infrastructure
and technologies or products and increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of operations.
Those risks can increase where the joint venture is formed by and among entities that, but for the joint
venture, would compete with each other in certain markets, as is the case to some degree with Exal and the
Ardagh Carve-out Business. Integrating Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business may require significant
resources and management attention. In addition, the cost savings and synergies that have been estimated
in connection with the Combination may prove to be unrealistic or unobtainable for a number of reasons,
including the fact that certain key managers, executive officers and directors of Exal and the Ardagh
Carve-out Business were unable to share certain proprietary business information with each other prior to
obtaining antitrust and competition law approval from regulatory authorities.

In order to successfully combine and operate Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business, our
management will need to focus on managing the historical customer and supplier relationships of these
businesses while also working to realize the anticipated synergies and cost savings on a timely basis. Our
operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to successfully manage the integration of Exal and
the Ardagh Carve-out Business. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and synergies may be
affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:

  - the ability of business units and employees from different corporate heritages to work together
effectively; and

   - the ability to leverage a low-cost, efficient distribution system, and optimize procurement savings
with respect to certain raw materials.

Moreover, the potential cost savings and synergies we currently expect to result from the Combination
are only estimates and may not actually be achieved in the time frame anticipated or at all.

In addition, the Combination could subject us to additional risks, including:

   - costs relating to the Combination and related transactions, such as financing, legal and accounting
fees, as well as unanticipated or higher than expected one-off costs related to operating the
business;

  - uncertainties relating to the Combination and related transactions may adversely affect
relationships with our employees, vendors and customers. For example, we estimate that
approximately $300 million of our revenue is sourced from overlapping current customers of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal; and

   - difficulty meeting our external reporting obligations because Exal has historically used different
accounting principles than the Ardagh Carve-out Business.

Furthermore, there may be additional costs or liabilities associated with the Combination that are not
currently anticipated, including unexpected loss of key employees or customers and hiring additional
management and other critical personnel. Also, please see the description of additional integration-related
risks in ‘‘—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may incur unforeseen risks and costs relating to

-----

acquisitions.’’ Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_The pro forma financial information included in this Offering Memorandum may not necessarily reflect what the_**
**_results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Trivium would have been if operated on a combined_**
**_basis._**

The respective business operations of Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business have been operated
separately prior to the Combination. We have no prior history as a combined entity and our operations
have not previously been managed on a combined basis. Therefore, the historical financial statements and
pro forma financial data presented in this Offering Memorandum may not reflect what our results of
operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated on a combined basis and
may not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the
future.

The Combination has not been completed and, as a result, we are currently not in a position to
measure fair values and make related adjustments to recorded values of the assets and liabilities of Exal
and the Ardagh Carve-out Business, respectively, as required by applicable IFRS rules. However, we will
make these adjustments, which will be reflected in our financial statements following the Combination.
This Offering Memorandum contains certain pro forma financial information that shows certain income
statement and balance sheet items, including revenues and EBITDA, of Exal when added to the
corresponding items, respectively, of the Ardagh Carve-out Business, without any adjustments for the
effect of IFRS purchase accounting. The pro forma financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the SEC
or U.S. GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have been
audited in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) or U.S. GAAS. This pro forma
information should therefore not be relied on to reflect what our results of operations and financial
condition would have looked like had the Combination already occurred. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Information.’’

**_We have no operating history as a standalone company_**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements included in this Offering
Memorandum have been prepared specifically for the purpose of facilitating the Combination and the
establishment of Trivium. The businesses, operations, assets and liabilities comprising the Ardagh
Carve-out Business have not in the past operated as a separate stand-alone entity or group, and, therefore,
the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of
future results of those businesses.

For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Ardagh Carve-out
Business Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements, please see Note 2 ‘‘Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies’’ to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Annual Audited Combined Carve-Out Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Trivium may have liabilities that we are unaware of._**

As a result of the Combination, we have assumed certain of Exal’s and the Ardagh Carve-out
Business’ liabilities, including certain pension liabilities. There may be liabilities that we underestimated,
failed to discover or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations into
Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business. Specifically with respect to environmental liabilities, we cannot
assure you that our due diligence investigations in conjunction with the Combination identified or
accurately quantified all material environmental matters related to the acquired facilities. Any such
liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial

44


-----

condition and results of operations. As we integrate Trivium, we may learn additional information about
Trivium that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to
compliance with applicable laws.

**_The consent of certain customers of and suppliers to Trivium is required to transfer their agreements and working_**
**_capital arrangements with Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business to us._**

The consent of certain counterparties to agreements of Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business and
certain of their respective material customers and suppliers are required to transfer those agreements to
us. If these consents are not obtained, the business conducted by Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business
with these customers and suppliers may be curtailed, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues
following the Combination. We also rely on such counterparties for trade finance to meet our working
capital needs. Therefore, even if such counterparties consent to transfer such agreements to us, if they do
not continue to provide us with the trade finance arrangements, each of Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out
Business have historically benefited from, there is a risk that our working capital, taking into account the
ABL Facility, could be insufficient for the needs of our business. Additional working capital may not be
available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The Transaction Agreement provides that if any
of these consents are not obtained before the Completion Date, Exal and Ardagh will cooperate with each
other to put in place arrangements that will give us the benefits and burdens of the agreements for which
consents have not been obtained before the Completion Date, but there can be no assurance that these
arrangements will provide us with the same level of benefits under these agreements as we would receive if
these contracts had actually been assigned to us.

**_A significant write-down of goodwill or intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

As a result of the Combination, our pro forma balance sheet as of March 31, 2019, includes goodwill
and intangible assets of $2,446 million. We will evaluate goodwill and intangible assets annually (or more
frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. The valuation methods used will include those
requiring the use of a weighted average cost of capital to calculate the present value of the expected future
cash flows of our groups of cash generating units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows
or other factors may cause our goodwill or intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge
against results of operations to write down goodwill or intangible assets for the amount of the impairment.
If a significant write-down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Element and the Ardagh Group may compete with us in certain businesses, including the aluminum bottles_**
**_business._**

While the Shareholders Agreement that will be entered into with Element and the Ardagh Group will
restrict the ability of Element and the Ardagh Group and their respective subsidiaries from competing with
our business, it will not prohibit the Ardagh Group and its subsidiaries from engaging and participating in
any capacity in the business of developing, manufacturing, marketing or selling containers for the beverage
market, including aluminum bottles. The scope of the non-compete is also limited to the development,
manufacture, marketing or sale of metal food or specialty cans (including aerosol cans), in each case, as
developed, manufactured, marketed and sold by us on the Completion Date. In addition, Element and the
Ardagh Group and their respective subsidiaries may compete with our business in any way that does not
involve the development, manufacture, marketing or sale of metal food or specialty cans (including aerosol
cans), in each case, as developed, manufactured, marketed or sold by us on the date of the Transaction
Agreement, including with products that are not, but which compete with, metal food or specialty cans
products, or by the development, manufacture, marketing or sale of metal food or specialty cans in ways
that we do not currently (and will not at the closing of the Combination) engage but may in the future

-----

adopt. If we experience significant competition from Element and/or the Ardagh Group, it could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our overlapping directors with Element and/or the Ardagh Group may result in the diversion of corporate_**
**_opportunities to Element and/or the Ardagh Group and other conflicts._**

Our directors may also be serving as directors, officers, employees or agents of Element and/or the
Ardagh Group, and we may engage in material business transactions with Element and/or Ardagh Group.
The Shareholders Agreement will expressly provide that it does not intend to, and will not, create or
impose any fiduciary duties on any director serving on the management or supervisory boards of the Parent
Guarantor, any shareholder or their respective affiliates in addition to those imposed by applicable law or
modify any such duties imposed on any such person under applicable law. Also, conflicts may arise if there
are issues or disputes under the Transaction Agreement, the Shareholders Agreement, the MSA, the IP
Cross License Agreement or other agreements we enter into with the Ardagh Group, and any other
agreements that exist between Element or the Ardagh Group and us. In addition, the Shareholders
Agreement will expressly allow each shareholder, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors and
other related persons to engage or invest in any business opportunity of any type, including those corporate
business opportunities that might be similar or the same as those in which we engage, and they shall not be
obligated to present any corporate business opportunity to us or any other shareholder. Each of Element,
the Ardagh Group and the Parent Guarantor will renounce any and all interests or expectations in, or the
right to be informed of, any such potential corporate business opportunities. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances, the interests of the directors or shareholders of the Parent Guarantor or their respective
affiliates may compete against the Parent Guarantor or pursue opportunities instead of the Parent
Guarantor, for which the Parent Guarantor will have no recourse. These actions on the part of the officers,
directors or shareholders of the Parent Guarantor or their respective affiliates could adversely impact the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Parent Guarantor. For a further discussion of
the rights and obligations of Element and the Ardagh Group as shareholders, see ‘‘The Combination—
Shareholders Agreement.’’

**_Element and the Ardagh Group will have joint control over the Parent Guarantor after the Completion Date and_**
**_their interests may conflict with each other, or with your interests as a holder of the Notes._**

The Shareholders Agreement will provide that Element may designate or nominate up to five
directors to the Parent Guarantor’s supervisory board and the Ardagh Group may designate or nominate
up to four directors to the Parent Guarantor’s supervisory board. The Ardagh Group and Element
(including their respective permitted transferees) will agree to vote all of their respective shares in favor of
the election of such nominees. The Shareholders Agreement will also provide that certain matters will
require the prior approval of shareholders constituting more than 70% of the then-outstanding shares of
the Parent Guarantor. See ‘‘The Combination—Shareholders Agreement.’’ As a result, after this offering
the Parent Guarantor will be jointly controlled by Element and the Ardagh Group. In addition, each of
Element and the Ardagh Group may, in its capacity as a shareholder, approve transactions, agreements or
other actions that may favor its own interests over our interests. In certain circumstances, the interests of
Element and the Ardagh Group may conflict with your interests as holders of the Notes. For example,
Element and the Ardagh Group could cause us to incurr material indebtedness, sell certain material assets
or pay dividends, in each case so long as the Indentures, the ABL Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement
so permit.

**_Our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we are unable to cost-effectively establish our own_**
**_administrative and other support functions in order to operate as a standalone company after the expiration of the_**
**_MSA with the Ardagh Group._**

We rely on administrative and other resources of the Ardagh Group, including information
technology, accounting, finance, human resources, procurement and legal to operate our business. In
connection with the Combination, we expect to enter into a mutual services agreement with the Ardagh
Group to retain the ability for specified periods to use these Ardagh Group resources. See ‘‘Major
Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions—Mutual Services Agreement.’’
These services may not be provided at the same level as when the Ardagh Carve-out Business was part of
the Ardagh Group, and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits that we received prior to the
Combination. These services may not be sufficient to meet our needs, and after our mutual services
agreement with the Ardagh Group expires, we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain
these services at prices and on terms as favorable as we currently have with the Ardagh Group. We will
need to create our own administrative and other support systems or contract with third parties to replace
the Ardagh Group’s systems. In addition, we have received informal support from the Ardagh Group
which may not be addressed in the mutual services agreement we expect to enter into with the Ardagh
Group, and the level of this informal support may diminish as we become a more independent company.
Any failure or significant downtime in our own administrative systems or in the Ardagh Group’s
administrative systems during the transitional period could result in unexpected costs, impact our results
and/or prevent us from paying our suppliers or employees and performing other administrative services on
a timely basis.

**Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under_**
**_the Notes._**

We have a substantial amount of debt and significant debt service obligations. On a pro forma basis,
after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total debt of $2,853 million, of which
$2,246 million would have been secured. As of March 31, 2019, we would have had additional availability
under our main credit facilities of up to $250 million. See ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
Information.’’

Our substantial debt could have important negative consequences for us and for you as a holder of the
Notes. For example, our substantial debt could:

  - require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to service debt and fund
repayments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital,
capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;

   - increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;

   - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industry in which
we operate;

   - limit our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future;

   - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities;

   - make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt; and

  - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.

In addition, a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market
interest rates. Although we may hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates by entering into
interest rate swaps, we cannot assure you that we will do so in the future. As a result, an increase in market

47


-----

interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations, which would exacerbate
the risks associated with our leveraged capital structure.

**_Certain of our credit facilities contain financial covenants which we could fail to meet._**

We anticipate that the ABL Facility will require, and our future credit facilities may require, the
Parent Guarantor and certain of its subsidiaries to satisfy specified financial tests and maintain specified
financial ratios and covenants regarding a minimum level of EBITDA to net interest expense, a minimum
level of EBITDA to total debt, and a maximum amount of capital expenditures, all as defined in such
credit facilities. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

The ability of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these ratios and to meet these
tests may be affected by events beyond their control and there can be no assurances that they will continue
to meet these tests. The failure of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these
obligations could lead to a default under these credit facilities unless we can obtain waivers or consents in
respect of any breaches of these obligations under these credit facilities. We cannot assure you that these
waivers or consents will be granted. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the
required financial ratios could result in a default under these credit facilities. In the event of any default
under these credit facilities, the lenders under these facilities will not be required to lend any additional
amounts to us or our operating subsidiaries and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together
with accrued interest, fees and other amounts due thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. In the
event of a default, the relevant lenders (and, potentially, the trustee under any of the Notes) could also
require us to apply all available cash to repay the borrowings or prevent us from making debt service
payments on the Notes, any of which would be an event of default under these Notes. If the debt under our
credit facilities or the Notes were to be accelerated, there can be no assurances that our assets would be
sufficient to repay such debt in full.

**_If the conditions in the Escrow Agreements are not satisfied, the Issuer will be required to redeem the Notes, which_**
**_means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes; the conditions to release of the proceeds from the_**
**_Escrow Accounts are limited._**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, an amount equal to the gross proceeds received from the sale of the
Notes, will be held in escrow pending the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including the closing
of the Combination. As such amount will not include any interest on the Notes from the Issue Date until
the earlier of (i) the completion of the Combination and (ii) the Escrow Longstop Date. If the conditions
precedent to the Combination have not been satisfied before the Escrow Longstop Date or in the event of
certain other events that trigger escrow termination, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption as described in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.’’ If this were to happen, you may not obtain the return you expected to receive on the Notes.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Only limited changes in our
business or financial condition, or the terms of the Combination, between the closing of this offering and
the earlier of (i) the closing of the Combination and (ii) the Escrow Longstop Date, will cause the Issuer to
effect a Special Mandatory Redemption and thereby return the principal amount of the Notes to you. In
addition, the release of funds from the Escrow Accounts is not conditioned on guarantees by the
Post-Completion Date Guarantors of the Notes or the grant of liens in the Collateral in favor of the Notes.
The funds may be released even if certain defaults exist under the Indentures, subject to certain
restrictions. Upon delivery to the Escrow Agent, the Security Agent and the Trustee of an officer’s
certificate stating that the conditions to the escrow are satisfied, the Escrowed Property will be released to
the Issuer and utilized as described in ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’ See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

48


-----

**_We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt._**

Subject to the restrictions in our credit facilities, the Indentures and other outstanding debt, we may
be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, which could also be secured.

We anticipate that the ABL Facility will permit additional borrowings of up to $250 million, which
could be secured and would effectively rank senior to the Senior Notes, to the extent in respect of the value
of the collateral securing such debt. See ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Information.’’ Although the terms of the ABL Facility, the Indentures and other
outstanding debt contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to
a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and debt incurred in compliance with these
restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels,
the substantial leverage related risks described above would increase. See also ‘‘—Risks Relating to Our
Business—We may incur unforeseen risks and costs relating to acquisitions.’’

**_Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate the_**
**_cash required to service our debt._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on the Notes and to meet our other debt service obligations
or refinance our debt depends on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate
cash. This will be affected by our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, as well as general
economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors beyond our control. If we cannot
generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs, we may,
among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, obtain additional
financing, delay planned acquisitions or capital expenditures or sell assets. There can be no assurances that
we will be able to generate sufficient cash through any of the foregoing. If we are not able to refinance any
of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may
not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including the Notes. See ‘‘The Trivium
Business—Liquidity and Capital Resources.’’

We expect to be able to repay or refinance the principal amounts outstanding under our outstanding
indebtedness (including the Notes) upon maturity. We may, however, be unable to repay or refinance such
principal amounts on terms satisfactory to us or at all.

**_Restrictions imposed by the Indentures and certain of our other credit facilities limit our ability to take certain_**
**_actions._**

The Indentures and certain of our other credit facilities limit our flexibility in operating our business.
For example, these agreements restrict or limit the ability of the Parent Guarantor and certain of its
subsidiaries to, among other things:

  - borrow money;

   - pay dividends or make other distributions;

   - create certain liens;

   - make certain asset dispositions;

  - make certain loans or investments;

   - issue or sell share capital of our subsidiaries;

  - guarantee indebtedness;

   - enter into transactions with affiliates; or

   - merge, consolidate or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

49


-----

There can be no assurances that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the
Indentures and certain of our other credit facilities will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future
operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. Any future
indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms. In addition, management believes that the
future expansion of our packaging business may require participation in the consolidation of the packaging
industry by the acquisition of existing packaging businesses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to
participate in such consolidation or that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the
Indentures and certain of our other credit facilities will permit us to do so.

In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, a breach of the covenants in the
Indentures could cause a default under the terms of our other financing agreements, causing all the debt
under those agreements to be accelerated. If this were to occur, we can make no assurances that we would
have sufficient assets to repay our debt.

**_We may be unable to repurchase the Notes as required upon a Change of Control._**

If we experience a Change of Control, we would be required to make an offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of repurchase. However, we may be unable to do so because we might not have enough available funds,
particularly since a Change of Control could in certain circumstances cause part or all of our other debt to
become due and payable. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control’’ and
‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control.’’

**_The insolvency laws of The Netherlands and other local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S._**
**_bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar._**

Trivium Packaging Finance B.V., the Issuer of the Notes, and the Parent Guarantor are incorporated
in The Netherlands. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, 90 days following the Completion Date, the
Notes will be guaranteed by the Post-Completion Date Guarantors. Most of the Post-Completion Date
Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of one of British Columbia (Canada), Denmark,
England and Wales, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland and Spain. The insolvency
laws of foreign jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as the laws of the United States or
other jurisdictions with which you are familiar. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the
Guarantors or any other of Trivium Packaging B.V.’s subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings
would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**_The Issuer’s ability to pay principal and interest on the Notes may be affected by our organizational structure. The_**
**_Issuer is dependent upon payments from other members of our corporate group to fund payments to you on the_**
**_Notes, and such other members might not be able to make such payments in some circumstances._**

The Issuer does not conduct any business operations and does not have any assets or sources of
income of its own, other than the intercompany notes made to on-lend the net proceeds from the offering
of the Notes as described below. As a result, the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes is
dependent directly upon interest or other payments they receive from other members of our corporate
group. Initially, the proceeds of the Notes will be loaned to other members of our corporate group
pursuant to intercompany notes. These intercompany notes may be subordinated to senior debt of the
relevant intercompany borrowers. The Indentures will not require the maintenance of these intercompany
notes. Accordingly, you should only rely on the Guarantees of the Notes, and not these intercompany
notes, to provide credit support in respect of payments of principal or interest on the Notes. The ability of
other members of our corporate group to make payments to the Issuer will depend upon their cash flows
and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these ‘‘Risk Factors.’’

50


-----

Furthermore, some of our credit facilities contain certain restrictions on the borrowers thereunder
from making certain distributions or payments of capital or income to their members. As a result, the
amounts that the Issuer expects to receive from other members of our corporate group may not be
forthcoming or sufficient to enable the Issuer to service its obligations on the Notes.

The Parent Guarantor and the Post-Completion Date Guarantors will guarantee the Notes. The
Parent Guarantor is a holding company with no assets or sources of income of its own and thus is
dependent on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries. The Post-Completion Date
Guarantors are either intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or the Security Interests across multiple_**
**_jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, which is incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands, and
will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor, which is incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands.
Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, 90 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will be
guaranteed by the Post-Completion Date Guarantors. The Post-Completion Date Guarantors of the Notes
are incorporated under the laws of one of British Columbia (Canada), Delaware (United States),
Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Ohio (United States),
Poland and Spain. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated
in any of these countries. Such multi jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for
creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your
rights. Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to the insolvency and administrative
laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your
rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other
and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and
other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. The
application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes and the
Guarantees in these jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Post-Completion Date Guarantors are organized
limit the ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a sister company. See ‘‘—Corporate benefit,
capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely
affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests.’’

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against the independent auditors._**

See ‘‘Independent Accountants’’ for a description of the reports of the independent auditors of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business. The independent auditors’ report states that they were prepared solely for the
directors of the Ardagh Group, as a body, in accordance with the terms of their engagement letter dated
June 5, 2019, and the independent auditors do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than
the directors of the Ardagh Group, as a body, for its audit work, for its reports or for the conclusions or
opinions it has formed. The independent auditors’ reports on the non-statutory combined financial
statements of the Ardagh Carve-out Business, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, were
unqualified and are included in this Offering Memorandum. PricewaterhouseCoopers was the auditor of
the Ardagh Carve-out Business for these accounting periods.

Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the respective independent
auditor confirmed that it does not accept or assume any responsibility to parties (such as the purchasers of
the Notes) other than to the directors of Ardagh Group S.A., as a body, with respect to their reports and to

51


-----

the independent auditor’s audit work, conclusions and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting
language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of
securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report filed under the Exchange Act. If a U.S.
court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that investors in the
Notes may have against the independent auditor based on its report or the combined financial statements
to which it relates could be limited.

**_An active trading market may not develop for the Notes._**

The Notes are new securities for which there is currently no existing market. Although application has
been made for listing particulars to be approved by Euronext Dublin and for the Notes to be admitted to
the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its Global Exchange Market, we cannot
assure you that the Secured Notes or the Senior Notes will become or will remain listed. We cannot assure
you as to the liquidity of any market that may develop for the Notes, the ability of holders of the Notes to
sell them or the price at which the holders of the Notes may be able to sell them. The liquidity of any
market for the Notes will depend on the number of holders of the Notes, prevailing interest rates, the
market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions and our own
financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as recommendations by securities analysts.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt, such as the Notes, has been subject to disruptions
that have caused substantial price volatility. There can be no assurances that if a market for the Notes were
to develop, such a market would not be subject to similar disruptions. We have been informed by the Initial
Purchasers that they intend to make a market for the Notes after the offering is completed. However, the
Initial Purchasers are not obligated to do so and may cease their market-making activity at any time
without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S.
Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active
trading market for the Notes will develop or, if one does develop, that it will be maintained.

**_The Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer._**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state
securities laws. You may not offer the Notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or
a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. We have not undertaken to register the
Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future. Furthermore, we have not registered the
Notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of
the Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See ‘‘Notice
to Investors.’’

**_Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders
of Notes. The common depositary (or its nominee) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream Banking
will be the registered holder of the Regulation S Euro Global Notes and the Rule 144A Euro Global
Notes, and DTC, or its nominee, will be the registered holder of the Regulation S Euro Global Notes and
the Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes (as such terms are defined in ‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form’’). After
payment to the common depositary or DTC’s custodian, as the case may be, we, the Trustee and the
Principal Paying Agent will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other
amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely
on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, as applicable, and if you are not a
participant in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream Banking, on the procedures of the participant through

52


-----

which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder under the Indentures. See
‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form.’’

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct
right to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the
Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have
received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream Banking or, if applicable, a
participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will
be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Secured Indenture and/or the Senior
Indenture, unless and until definitive registered notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if
you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
Banking. We, the Trustee, and the Principal Paying Agent cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream Banking will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Notes. See ‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form.’’

**_You may be unable to serve process on us or our directors and officers in the United States and enforce U.S._**
**_judgments based on the Notes._**

Trivium Packaging Finance B.V., the Issuer of the Notes, and the Parent Guarantor of the Notes are
incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, 90 days
following the Completion Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Post-Completion Date Guarantors.
Most of the Post-Completion Date Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of one of
British Columbia (Canada), Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The
Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and
such Guarantors live outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Trivium Packaging
Finance B.V. and the Guarantors (other than the Post-Completion Date Guarantors in Delaware and Ohio
(United States)), and substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located
outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons in
the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability
provisions of the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Danish, Dutch, English, French,
German, Italian, Polish and Spanish counsel have informed us that it is questionable whether a Danish,
Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish or Spanish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil
liability if proceedings were commenced in Denmark, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France,
Germany, Italy, Poland or Spain predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. See ‘‘Service of
Process and Enforcement of Judgments.’’

**_Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may_**
**_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests._**

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Post-Completion Date Guarantors are organized
limit the ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt of a related company or grant security on account of
a related company’s debts. These limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate law
which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a
guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and
economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective, as well as thin
capitalization, unfair consideration, financial assistance, corporate purpose or similar law affecting the
rights of creditors generally and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations were not observed, the
Guarantees and the grant of Security Interests by these Post-Completion Date Guarantors could be subject
to legal challenge. In some jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of debt
guaranteed or secured so that applicable local law restrictions will not be violated. Certain of the Security
Documents will contain similar limitations. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a

53


-----

Post-Completion Date Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions or seek to enforce a Security Interest in
Collateral granted by a Post-Completion Date Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are
likely to be limited. In some cases, where the amount that can be guaranteed or secured is limited by
reference to the net assets and legal capital of the Post-Completion Date Guarantor or by reference to the
outstanding debt owed by the relevant Post-Completion Date Guarantor to the Issuer under intercompany
loans, that amount might have reached zero or close to zero at the time of any insolvency or enforcement.
Furthermore, although we believe that the Guarantees by these Post-Completion Date Guarantors and the
Security Interests granted by these Post-Completion Date Guarantors will be validly given in accordance
with local law restrictions, there can be no assurance that a third-party creditor would not challenge these
Guarantees and the Security Interests and prevail in court.

The Indentures will provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Trustee or the
Security Agent, as applicable, will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Notes, the
Guarantees and the Security Interests. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement restricts the rights of
holders of the Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take other legal actions against the
Post-Completion Date Guarantors, and by accepting any Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these
restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse
under the Guarantees and the Security Interests in the event of a default by the Issuer or a
Post-Completion Date Guarantor.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Generally, holders of indebtedness of,
and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are
entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made
available for distribution to any Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholders.

Accordingly, in the event that any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or
otherwise reorganizes:

   - the creditors of the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed
against such subsidiary’s assets; and

   - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to
payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before any
Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such
subsidiary.

As of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis, our non-guarantor subsidiaries would have had
$2 million of debt outstanding and $216 million of trade payables and deferred taxes, all of which would
have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. See ‘‘Capitalization.’’

**_Insolvency laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests, including fraudulent_**
**_conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

Our obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. Subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, 90 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Post-Completion
Date Guarantors. The Post-Completion Date Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of
one of British Columbia (Canada), Delaware (United States), Denmark, England and Wales, France,
Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Ohio (United States), Poland and Spain.

Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and
conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees and the Security
Interests, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit
the enforceability of the Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests.

54


-----

The court or an insolvency administrator may also in certain circumstances avoid the Security Interest or
the Guarantee where the company is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following discussion of
fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable
terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency
statutes.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations
generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court,
if it makes certain findings, to:

   - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Security
Interests;

   - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security to the
relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and

   - take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found
to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever
repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under
its Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or
Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise
being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the Security Documents will also be
limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a
determination of the maximum liability of each. Also, there is a possibility that the Guarantees or Security
Interests may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the
relevant Guarantor:

   - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or
created such security after its insolvency;

   - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman
as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor; or

   - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee
or Security Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our
benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or
rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the Security
Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to
engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or
(iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required
payments as and when they would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in
different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security
Interest if:

   - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets;

  - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; and/or

55


-----

   - the present salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts
and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute.

Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the offering of the Notes,
there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that,
regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that
date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the
date its Guarantee was issued or Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes
constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

**_We do not present separate financial statements for each Post-Completion Date Guarantor._**

We have not presented in this Offering Memorandum separate financial statements for each
Post-Completion Date Guarantor, and we are not required to do so in the future under the Secured
Indenture or the Senior Indenture.

**_You will not have the benefit of the guarantees from any of the Post-Completion Date Guarantors on the Issue Date._**

The Guarantees, other than the Secured Notes Parent Guarantee and Senior Notes Parent Guarantee
by the Parent Guarantor, will not be in effect, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, until 90 days
following the Completion Date with respect to the Guarantees by the Post-Completion Date Guarantors.

**_Certain changes in Dutch tax law related to The Netherlands government’s plan to combat tax avoidance may have_**
**_an adverse effect on us and may entitle us to redeem the Notes._**

On October 10, 2017, the new Dutch government released its policy statement
(Regeerakkoord 2017-2021 ‘‘Vertrouwen in de toekomst’’). The policy statement does not include concrete
legislative proposals, but instead sets out a large number of policy intentions of the new Dutch
government. In the policy statement, it was announced that The Netherlands will introduce a new
withholding tax on interest payments paid to low-taxed jurisdictions.

In a letter dated February 23, 2018, to the Dutch Parliament, the Dutch Under-Minister of Finance
published more details about the proposed introduction of withholding tax on interest payments.
According to the letter, the interest withholding tax would apply to intragroup interest payments by a
Dutch resident entity to entities that are resident (i) in a jurisdiction with a low statutory tax rate or (ii) in a
jurisdiction included in the E.U. list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. In addition, the letter states that
measures will be taken to counteract ‘‘abusive situations’’ (misbruiksituaties). According to the letter,
abusive situations include situations where a payment of interest is not made directly to a low-taxed or
non-cooperative jurisdiction, but where such interest indirectly reaches such jurisdiction by means of an
artificial construction.

In his letter, the Dutch Under-Minister of Finance announced that it is intended for the withholding
tax on interest payments to be effective from 2021 and that a legislative proposal will be submitted to the
Dutch parliament in 2019. This was reiterated by the Dutch Under-Minister of Finance in one of the
legislative proposals published on budget day 2018 (Prinsjesdag 2018).

The exact scope of the proposed legislation is not yet certain. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that
the envisaged interest withholding tax could have a wider application and, as such, it could potentially be
applicable to payments made by the Issuer and Guarantors under the Notes. If such payments become
subject to Dutch withholding tax under the envisaged legislation, the Issuer and Guarantors generally will
be required to pay Additional Amounts (see ‘‘Taxation—Netherlands Taxation,’’ ‘‘Description of the
Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes’’),
which may give rise to an event whereby the Issuer may be entitled to redeem the Notes (see ‘‘Description

56


-----

of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Optional
Redemption’’).

**Risks Relating to the Secured Notes**

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Secured Notes and the Secured Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to_**
**_satisfy our obligations under the Secured Notes and the Collateral securing the Secured Notes may be reduced or_**
**_diluted under certain circumstances._**

The Secured Notes and the Secured Notes Guarantees are secured by first priority security interests
on the Collateral as described in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures on a first
priority basis our and our subsidiaries’ obligations under certain hedging obligations. The Collateral may
also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indentures. Your rights to the
Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the
Collateral securing the Secured Notes. The ABL Facility will have lien priority and other advantages over
the Secured Notes with respect to the ABL Collateral, and the holders of indebtedness under the ABL
Facility will be entitled to be paid out of the proceeds of the ABL Collateral upon an insolvency or an
enforcement action before the proceeds are applied to pay obligations with respect to the Secured Notes
and the Secured Notes Guarantees.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend
upon many factors including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the
condition of the economies in which our operations are located, the availability of buyers and other factors.
The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets.
Portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. The
Collateral is located in a number of countries, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the
Collateral may limit the realizable value of the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured debt
or third parties enjoy liens (including statutory liens), whether or not permitted by the Secured Indenture,
such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral securing the
Secured Notes and the Secured Notes Guarantees which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available
to satisfy the obligations under the Secured Notes and the Secured Notes Guarantees.

**_The Security Interests over the Collateral have been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the holders of the Secured Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local_**
**_law._**

In France, Germany, The Netherlands and Poland, the security over the Collateral that constitutes, or
will constitute, security for the obligations of the Issuer under the Secured Notes and the Secured
Indenture is not granted directly to the noteholders but only in favor of the Security Agent, as beneficiary
of parallel debt obligations (‘‘Parallel Debt’’). This Parallel Debt was created to satisfy a requirement
under the respective laws of France, Germany, The Netherlands and Poland that the Security Agent, as
grantee of certain types of collateral, be a creditor of the relevant Post-Completion Date Guarantor. The
Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the Issuer under the
Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes (the ‘‘Principal Obligations’’). Any payment in respect of the
Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the
Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. The Security Agent has, pursuant to
the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer for the full principal amount of the Secured Notes. The
holders of the Notes are not entitled to enforce such security except through the Security Agent. Holders
of the Secured Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security
Agent. The Parallel Debt obligations referred to above are contained in the Secured Indenture, which is
governed by New York law. There is no assurance that such a structure will be effective before French,
German, Dutch or Polish courts as there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the
ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted.

57


-----

**_You will not have a security interest in all of the Collateral on the Issue Date and you will not have the benefit of the_**
**_guarantees from any of the Post-Completion Date Guarantors on the Issue Date._**

You will not have a security interest in the Collateral, other than the Escrow Collateral and limited
Issue Date Collateral, in place on the Issue Date and the Guarantees, other than the Secured Notes Parent
Guarantee and Senior Notes Parent Guarantee by the Parent Guarantor, will also not be in effect, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, until 90 days following the Completion Date. Until such time as all the
Collateral is in place, the Issuer’s obligation to pay interest on the Notes will be an unsecured obligation
during this period and will rank behind their secured obligations to the extent such amount is insufficient
to pay the interest on the Secured Notes.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, we will be required under the Secured Indenture to provide
security over the Fixed Asset Collateral and the ABL Collateral no later than 90 days following the
Completion Date. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ and ‘‘Description of Other
Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.’’ Failure to comply with these obligations would constitute a
default under the Secured Indenture.

Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the delivery of Collateral may negatively
impact the value of the Collateral. To the extent a lien in certain Collateral is perfected following the Issue
Date, it might be avoidable in bankruptcy or create new hardening periods. See ‘‘—The granting of the
Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Secured Notes may create hardening periods for
such Security Interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions.’’

**_The granting of the Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Secured Notes may create hardening_**
**_periods for such Security Interests in accordance with the law applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of new Security Interests in connection with the issuance of the Secured Notes may
create hardening periods for such Security Interests in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening
period for these new Security Interests will run as from the moment each new Security Interest has been
granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the Security Interest granted, perfected or recreated were
to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be
declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

**_The Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes and the loans under our ABL Facility will bear interest at floating_**
**_rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes and the loans under our ABL Facility will bear interest
at floating rates of interest per annum equal to LIBOR or EURIBOR (as the case may be), as adjusted
periodically, plus a margin. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements
designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available
on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a
significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. These interest rates could
also rise significantly in the future. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest
expense associated with the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes and the loans under our ABL
Facility would correspondingly increase, thus reducing our cash flow.

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types
of rates and indices which are deemed to be ‘‘benchmarks’’ are the subject of ongoing national and
international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial
Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in
financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which
entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of
administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the
past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be

58


-----

predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no
longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021
(the ‘‘FCA Announcement’’). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the
current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR
benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions
by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or
LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other
consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including, but not limited to, the Senior
Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes and the ABL Facility, whose interest rates are linked to LIBOR and
EURIBOR). In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no
longer generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest, the
interest rate on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes would be calculated based on a successor
rate either generally accepted in the euro-zone, or if such rate was unavailable, by a successor rate selected
by the Issuer in consultation with an independent financial advisor. There can be no assurance that such a
successor rate would favorable to holders of the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes as EURIBOR.
Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or
prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability
to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_The Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees will be unsecured and the claims of secured creditors will have_**
**_priority._**

The Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees will be unsecured obligations of the Issuer and the
Senior Notes Guarantors, respectively. Debt under the ABL Facility and several of our facilities are, and
the Secured Notes will be, secured by liens on the property and assets of material operating subsidiaries of
the Parent Guarantor, as well as shares held by the Parent Guarantor in its material operating subsidiaries.
In addition, subject to the restrictions in our ABL Facility, the Indentures and in other outstanding debt,
we may be able to incur substantial additional secured debt. The secured creditors of the Issuer and the
Senior Notes Guarantors will have priority over the assets securing their debt to the extent of the value of
such assets. In the event that any of such secured debt becomes due or a secured lender proceeds against
the assets that secure the debt, the assets would be available to satisfy obligations under the secured debt
before any payment would be made on the Senior Notes or under any of the Senior Notes Guarantees.
Any assets remaining after repayment of our secured debt may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing
under the Senior Notes. As of March 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions,
the Parent Guarantor and the Post-Completion Date Guarantors would have had $2,246 million of secured
debt outstanding. See ‘‘Capitalization.’’

**THE COMBINATION**

Element and the Ardagh Group have agreed to form a joint venture named Trivium, which will own
the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal. Trivium will be operated and financed on an independent basis,
subject to the terms of the Shareholders Agreement described below and customary control rights of
shareholders in a privately held Dutch company. The Notes offered hereby form part of the overall
financing arrangements in connection with the Combination (as defined below).

The Combination remains subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt
of regulatory approvals and completion of works council consultation processes in France and The
Netherlands. Please see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Combination.’’

**The Combination**

The Combination will be documented in two main agreements: the Transaction Agreement and the
Shareholders Agreement. The summaries of the Transaction Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement
presented below do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by
reference to, the full text of the Transaction Agreement and Shareholders Agreement. Copies of the
Transaction Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement are available upon request to the Issuer.

**_Transaction Agreement_**

The Transaction Agreement has been entered into by and among Element, the Ardagh Group and the
Parent Guarantor. Under the Transaction Agreement, in exchange for the equity interests in the Ardagh
Carve-out Business, the Parent Guarantor will (i) issue to the Ardagh Group, or its designated controlled
affiliate, ordinary shares representing 43% of the Parent Guarantor’s issued and outstanding equity
interests, and (ii) pay to the Ardagh Group in cash the equivalent of $2,500 million (the ‘‘Ardagh Cash
Consideration’’) and in exchange for the equity interests in Exal, the Parent Guarantor will issue to
Element or its designated controlled affiliate, ordinary shares representing 57% of the Parent Guarantor’s
issued and outstanding equity interests (the ‘‘Combination’’). The Ardagh Cash Consideration as well as
the number of the Parent Guarantor’s ordinary shares to be issued to Element are subject to a customary
purchase price adjustment to reflect changes in our net debt, cash and net working capital between
execution of the Transaction Agreement and the Completion Date. If, however, the number of ordinary
shares issuable to Element after giving effect to the purchase price adjustment would result in Element
owning less than 51.0% of the Parent Guarantor’s ordinary shares, Element will receive 51.0% of the
Parent Guarantor’s ordinary shares and will pay to the Parent Guarantor, in cash, an amount equal to the
number of ordinary shares that would have been issued to Element in excess of 51.0% multiplied by the
per share price of $24.3831. The terms of the Transaction Agreement include, among other things:

  - Customary representations and warranties given by Element in respect of Exal and by the Ardagh
Group in respect of the Ardagh Carve-out Business.

  - Customary interim operating covenants in respect of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and in respect
of Exal, including requiring the Ardagh Group and Exal to conduct their respective businesses in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and restrictions on their ability to sell
assets, amend the organizational documents of any legal entities in the Ardagh Carve-out Business
or Exal, declare dividends, enter into material contracts, change their accounting policies or issue
any new securities, incur, assume or guarantee indebtedness.

  - Indemnification for certain losses in connection with the investigation initiated in 2015 by the
German competition authority. See ‘‘The Trivium Business—Legal Proceedings’’.

   - Conditions to closing of the Combination that need to be satisfied or waived in accordance with the
Transaction Agreement, including: (i) no action, order or law shall have been in effect that restrains
or prohibits the Combination or would rescind the Combination following the Completion Date,

60


-----

(ii) certain fundamental representations and warranties of each of Element and the Ardagh Group
being true and correct and other non-fundamental representations being true and correct except
where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect, (iii) each of Element and the Ardagh
Group having complied with their respective covenants under the Transaction Agreement in all
material respects, (iv) the obtaining of all required regulatory approvals and consents agreed among
the parties; (v) the completion of certain works council consultation processes in France and the
Netherlands; and (vi) issuing the Notes offered hereby and entering into the ABL Facility on terms
satisfactory to the Element and the Ardagh Group.

  - The right to terminate the Transaction Agreement by Element or the Ardagh Group (i) in the event
that not all of the conditions to closing set forth therein have been satisfactorily fulfilled or waived
by January 14, 2020 (the ‘‘Termination Date’’), provided the Termination Date may be extended to
April 14, 2020 in the event that regulatory approvals and consents are not obtained by such date;
(ii) in the event a government order permanently enjoins, restrains or prohibits the consummation
of the Combination; (iii) for a violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or
failure to perform any covenant or agreement, by the other party if such violation, breach or failure
gives rise to a material breach or failure to deliver a closing deliverable that, if curable, is not cured
within 20 business days; and (iv) by mutual written consent; provided that neither Element nor the
Ardagh Group is permitted to terminate the Transaction Agreement for the reasons described in
the foregoing clauses (i) or (iii) if, in the case of clause (i) its own breach of its representations,
warranties or covenants is the reason why the Combination failed to close by the Termination Date
or, in the case of clause (iii) it is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
under the Transaction Agreement and such breach is not cured within 20 business days and would
give rise to the failure of the closing conditions relating to breaches of representations, warranties
and covenants not to be satisfied.

None of the representations, warranties or covenants required to be performed prior to the
Completion Date will survive the closing of the Combination (other than the interim operating covenants
and expense reimbursement covenants, which will survive for a period of twelve months following such
closing). Post-closing covenants, including the covenant of the Ardagh Group to indemnify the Parent
Guarantor in respect of the German competition investigation described above, will survive the closing of
the Combination in accordance with their respective terms.

**_Shareholders Agreement_**

The Shareholders Agreement will be entered into by Element, the Ardagh Group and the Parent
Guarantor upon the closing of the Combination. The agreed form of the Shareholders Agreement
includes, among other things:

  - Customary provisions relating to the governance of the Parent Guarantor, including (i) the
formation of a nine person supervisory board (including up to five members to be designated or
nominated by Element and up to four members to be designated or nominated by the Ardagh
Group) and (ii) the formation a management board consisting of one or more directors, including
our chief executive officer and two observers to be appointed by each of Element and the Ardagh
Group.

  - Certain shareholder reserved matters that require the approval of shareholders holding shares
constituting at least 70% of the then-outstanding shares of the Parent Guarantor, including our
annual budget and five year business plan, material acquisitions or dispositions, mergers, demergers
or consolidations, issuances or repurchases of our shares, incurrence of indebtedness over a certain
amount, incurrence of unbudgeted capital expenditure (over a certain limit), related party
transactions, distributions or dividends, our adoption of a management incentive plan, or a change

in accounting policies, the adoption of the audited financial statements or the appointment or
termination of members of the senior management team.

- A non-competition covenant providing that none of Element or its subsidiaries and none of the
Ardagh Group or its subsidiaries will, directly or indirectly, engage in the development,
manufacture, marketing or sale of metal food or specialty cans (including aerosol cans), in each case
as developed, manufactured, marketed or sold by us at the Completion Date); _provided,_ _however,_
that the Ardagh Group will be free to engage and participate in the beverage market, and to
develop, manufacture, market or sell containers for the beverage market, including aluminum
bottles.

- A provision relating to aluminum bottles matters, and the right of Element or the supervisory board
members designated or nominated by Element, to take all actions and decisions on matters
concerning the business of manufacturing, marketing or selling of aluminum bottles as conducted by
us, subject to certain limitations.

- A customary non-solicitation covenant in respect of Element and the Ardagh Group, not to solicit,
induce or encourage any individual to leave the employ or to hire, employ, engage or otherwise
retain any individual who is an employee of, the other party or its affiliates.

- Provisions relating to restrictions on the transfer of shares in Trivium, including customary
tag-along, first refusal, pre-emptive and other rights associated with Element and the Ardagh
Group’s shareholdings.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be the equivalent of
$2,750 million. Pending the completion of the Transactions, an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the
issuance of the Notes will be deposited into the Escrow Accounts and will be released on the Completion
Date. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description
of the Senior Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

Upon satisfaction of the conditions to the release of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes from
escrow, the proceeds will be released and will be used to provide cash consideration to the Ardagh Group,
refinance certain indebtedness of Exal, for general corporate purposes and to pay fees and expenses
related to the Combination.

The following table sets out the expected sources and uses of the funds necessary to consummate the
Combination as if it had occurred on March 31, 2019. Actual amounts will vary from estimated amounts
depending on several factors, including changes in working capital at Trivium and differences from our
estimates of fees and expenses.

**SELECTED COMBINED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**
**OF THE ARDAGH CARVE-OUT BUSINESS**

The following table sets forth selected financial data and other data for the Ardagh Carve-out
Business for the periods ended and as of the dates indicated below. The historical financial data presented
in the following table do not reflect changes as a result of the Transactions. The selected financial data and
other data should be read in conjunction with ‘‘Summary Combined Financial and Other Data of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business,’’ ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects of the Ardagh Carve-out
Business—Results of Operations of Ardagh Carve-out Business’’ and the financial statements and related
notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of
future expected results.

We have derived the summary financial data as of and for the financial years ended December 31,
2018, 2017 and 2016 from the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Ardagh Carve-out Business
Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements reflect the metal food and specialty business of
Ardagh Group S.A. that have not in the past formed a separate accounting group. These businesses do not
constitute a separate legal entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements have been prepared by aggregating the financial information for the metal food and specialty
business, comprising the entities constituting the Ardagh Carve-out Business together with the assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the
Ardagh Carve-out Business.

For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Ardagh Carve-out
Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, please see Note 2 ‘‘Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies’’ to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This basis of preparation sets out the
method used in identifying the financial position, performance and cash flows of the metal food and
specialties businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements. The notes explain that the businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined
Carve-out Financial Statements have not operated as a separate stand-alone entity or group.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business adopted IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019, and applied the modified
retrospective approach which does not require restatement of prior periods. As detailed in Note 2 of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business Unaudited Interim Combined Financial Statements ‘‘Summary of significant
accounting policies,’’ the adoption of IFRS 16 impacts on the combined income statement and certain key
financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges recognized in the combined income
statement. The application of the new standard decreased both cost of sales and operating costs (excluding
depreciation) in the combined income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted
EBITDA, but this is largely offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and finance expenses.

(4) Total borrowings are defined as related party borrowings (which includes accrued interest payable to Ardagh), representing
certain components of the Ardagh Group’s corporate debt, finance lease obligations (the three months ended March 31, 2019,
include lease liabilities recognized as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019) and other borrowings.

(5) Adjusted EBITDA consists of profit before tax, net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional operating
items. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin are presented because we believe that they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other
interested parties in evaluating companies in the packaging industry. However, other companies may calculate Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin in a manner different from ours. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to profit/(loss) as
indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

The reconciliation of profit before tax to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

and excludes unamortized deferred financing fees and lease obligations.

(4) Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income, plus the following items: income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and
amortization, certain one-item or unusual items such as costs associated with the recovery from the Exal Packaging facility fire,
impairment of property, plant, and equipment, South American financial taxes, management change costs, restructuring
expenses including severance and expenses associated other special projects. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe
that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating companies in the packaging
industry. However, other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in a manner different from ours. Adjusted EBITDA is
not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to profit/(loss) as
indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(5) Capital expenditures is the sum of purchase of property, plant and equipment and software and other intangibles.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

While it has not yet been determined, the information contained in the unaudited pro forma
combined financial information included below has been presented on the basis that Trivium will record
the businesses contributed to it on formation at fair value, including goodwill. This involves measuring the
cost of the businesses contributed and allocating, at the Completion Date, the cost of the businesses
contributed to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values.
Identifiable assets contributed and liabilities assumed will be measured initially at their fair values at the
Completion Date. Trivium intends to measure the consideration transferred to each of the contributing
parties, including Trivium equity transferred, at fair value.

The Combination has not been completed, and, as a result, we are not currently in a position to
measure fair values and make the related adjustments to the recorded values of identifiable assets and
liabilities of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and the Exal business, respectively. Following completion of
the accounting for the Combination (including measurement of fair values), we will make any necessary
adjustments to recorded values of the contributed assets and liabilities. We currently expect that the
majority of the adjustments will result in adjustments to property, plant and equipment, the creation of
intangible assets and goodwill and an increase in the fair value of inventory. The adjustments to intangible
assets are likely to result in additional charges for amortization, which will have a negative effect on
operating profit. Similarly, the adjustment to inventory will result in a corresponding increase in cost of
sales which will be recognized and reduce operating profit during the period in which the acquired
inventory is sold. The unaudited pro forma financial information set forth below does not reflect any fair
value accounting adjustments for the Combination. The adjustments that will occur on completion of the
final accounting for the Combination could have a material impact on the pro forma combined financial
information.

The following unaudited pro forma income statement information for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2019, gives effect to Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2018. The summary
unaudited pro forma balance sheet data as of March 31, 2019, gives effect to the Transactions as if they had
occurred on that date. We are not presenting full pro forma balance sheet information in this Offering
Memorandum. This unaudited pro forma financial information is based on available information and
various assumptions that management believe to be reasonable, including the receipt of all consents and
approvals required for completion of the Transactions. Completion of the Transactions as contemplated in
this Offering Memorandum is subject to legally required staff consultation in certain jurisdictions. The
actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information
for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to
prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial information and actual amounts. The unaudited pro
forma financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent
what the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred on the
dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects a number of adjustments made to the financial
information of the Exal business. It is expected that Trivium will follow the presentation and accounting
policies applied by Ardagh and so no adjustments are required to adjust the accounting policies and
presentation of financial information followed by the Ardagh Carve-out Business for purposes of the
unaudited pro forma financial information. The compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial
information and the adjustments reflected therein are explained as follows:

  - Adjustments have been made to convert the underlying U.S. GAAP financial information set forth
in the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS and in alignment with the expected IFRS
accounting policies of Trivium. These adjustments are based on management’s analysis of the major
GAAP and accounting policy differences between Trivium and the Exal Consolidated Financial

Statements. There can be no assurance that a full IFRS conversion of the financial information set
forth in the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements to be performed on completion of the
Combination would not result in different numbers, and such differences may be material.

   - The underlying financial information of Exal has been adjusted to align the presentation of certain
income statement items with the expected presentation of such financial information by Trivium.

   - The impact of any new contractual agreements that are factually supportable, directly related to the
acquisitions and are expected to have a continuing impact.

The basis for the adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information and the key
assumptions made are explained in the notes to the information accompanying the tables.

The following pro forma financial information presented has not been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of Regulation S X under the Exchange Act or U.S. GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor
the resulting pro forma financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) or U.S. GAAS. The unaudited pro forma combined
financial information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the historical combined financial
statements and notes thereto of the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements
and the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements, both included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum,
‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects of the Ardagh Carve-out Business’’ and ‘‘Operating and

(i) Reclassifies certain items to conform to the format in which Trivium is expected to present its financial information.
The items impacted are the classification as exceptional operating items of certain one-off or unusual items, such as
FX gains and losses on volatile foreign currencies, primarily in South America, as well as costs associated with the
recovery from the Exal Packaging facility fire, impairment of property, plant, and equipment, management change
costs, restructuring expenses, including severance, and expenses associated with other special projects.

(ii) Cost of sales has been adjusted to include depreciation. There has been no impact on the balance sheet as a result
of this adjustment, with the exception of a reclassification for spare parts of $8 million between inventory and
property, plant and equipment.

(iii) Interest expense has been adjusted to include South American financial taxes. There has been no impact on the
balance sheet as a result of this adjustment.

(b) An assessment has been undertaken in order to convert the underlying U.S. GAAP financial information to IFRS. There
has been no material impact on the Pro Forma combined income statement or the Pro Forma combined balance sheet
data as a result of this assessment. Based on management analysis to date, no material impact to the Pro Forma combined
income statement or balance sheet data is expected as a result of IFRS 15 or IFRS 16.

(2) Trivium has not previously prepared or presented any financial information. Trivium has no income statement or balance sheet
activity other than de minimis amounts.

(3) Represents the increase in net finance expense associated with the elimination of the Ardagh Carve-out Business related party
debt and the Exal debt, and the addition of the finance expense (at assumed rates), of the Notes offered hereby. The finance
expense related to the Notes offered hereby includes the amortization of associated deferred financing costs. No adjustment has
been made in respect of finance expense associated with the ABL Facility.

(4) Reflects the additional cash and cash equivalents and the increase in indebtedness, net of estimated deferred financing costs
associated with the incurrence of new indebtedness, associated with the Notes offered hereby. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds.’’

incurred by the contributing parties.

(7) Reflects adjustments for the elimination of historic goodwill, the elimination of historic cash not acquired and the allocation to
goodwill of the excess of the estimated fair value of the businesses contributed to Trivium over the book value of the identified
assets and liabilities. No adjustment has been made in respect of the fair value of identified assets and liabilities as required by
IFRS. Fair value of the business has been determined based on a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA on which the two joint venture
parties agreed to contribute their respective businesses. See ‘‘The Combination.’’

(8) Reflects the elimination of Ardagh Carve-out Business related party debt and the Exal debt as that debt will not remain a
liability of Trivium upon completion of the transaction.

(9) Reflects the equity impact to Trivium of (i) the elimination of the historic equity/invested capital of Exal and the Ardagh
Carve-out Business, respectively, (ii) the estimated transaction costs as described in footnote 6, and (iii) the estimated fair value
of equity interests that will be issued as consideration for the Combination.

(10) Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is profit before tax, net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional
operating items. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues. Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin are presented because we believe that they are frequently
used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating companies in the packaging industry. However,
other companies may calculate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin in a manner different
from ours. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin are not measurements of financial
performance under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of
liquidity or an alternative to profit/(loss) on ordinary activities as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of
performance derived in accordance with IFRS.

**OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS OF**
**THE ARDAGH CARVE-OUT BUSINESS**

_The following discussion should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the_
_Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, including the related notes thereto,_
_included in this Offering Memorandum, beginning on page F-2. The following discussion should also be read in_
_conjunction with ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Data,’’ ‘‘Selected Combined Financial and Other Data_
_of the Ardagh Carve-out Business’’ and ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.’’ Except for_
_the historical information contained herein, the discussions in this section contain forward-looking statements_
_that reflect Ardagh Carve-out Business’ plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties. Ardagh_
_Carve-out Business’ actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking_
_statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those_
_discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, particularly in ‘‘Risk Factors’’ and ‘‘Forward-_
_Looking Statements.’’_

_Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to the ‘‘Ardagh Carve-out Business’’ we do not take_
_into account the effects of the Combination. Some of the measures used in this Offering Memorandum are not_
_measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to cash flow_
_from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to operating profit/(loss) or profit/(loss) for_
_the period as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in_
_accordance with IFRS._

metal packaging solutions. The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ products principally comprise metal packaging
in the form of cans and aerosol containers, and serve a broad range of end use categories, including food,

In 2018, the Ardagh Carve-out Business had 52 facilities, located in Europe, the United States,
Canada, Morocco, the Seychelles and South Korea, and approximately 6,800 employees producing
approximately 30 billion containers and components. The Ardagh Carve-out Business believes it enjoys
leadership positions in its key businesses with #1 or #2 positions in each of those businesses. The Ardagh
Carve-out Business believes that the Ardagh Carve-out Business is the #[1] can supplier to the European
nutrition and paints and coatings end use categories, as well as the supply of aerosol cans, which are
predominantly used in the beauty and personal care and household care sectors. In addition, the Ardagh
Carve-out Business believes that it was the #1 supplier of aerosol containers, collectively serving multiple
end use categories including beauty and personal care, food, household care and other uses. Moreover,
Ardagh Carve-out Business believes that it was the #2 can supplier to the food and seafood end use
categories in Europe and North America.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business serves over 1,200 customers across more than 70 countries, comprised
of multi-national companies, large national and regional companies and small local businesses. In the
Ardagh Carve-out Business’ target regions of Europe and North America, its customers include a wide
variety of CPG companies, which own some of the best known brands in the world. The Ardagh Carve-out
Business has a stable customer base with long-standing relationships and approximately 60% of its
revenues are generated under multi-year contracts, with the remainder largely subject to annual
arrangements, with a high degree of customer retention. A significant portion of the Ardagh Carve-out
Business’ revenues are generated under contracts which include input cost pass-through provisions, which
help us reduce margin volatility due to changes in raw material costs.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ plants are generally located in close proximity to its customers, with
some located near-site to its customers’ filling locations. The European facilities operate as a scalable and
flexible pan-European network while the North American production facilities, with three of its six
facilities constructed in the past 10 years, are well located to serve key customers and regions. Significant
capital has been invested in Ardagh Carve-out Business’ extensive network of long-lived production
facilities, which, together with its skilled workforce and related manufacturing process know-how, supports
the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ competitive positions.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business is committed to market-leading innovation and product development.
Its global operations are supported by a dedicated innovation, development and engineering center in
France. The 60 research and engineering specialists working at this facility enable the Ardagh Carve-out
Business to continuously improve design and consumer convenience, reduce costs and ensure compliance
with evolving standards and food safety regulations. Examples of the Ardagh Carve-out Business’
innovations include introducing two-piece fully bisphenol-A non-intentionally added (‘‘BPANIA’’) cans for
a major North American customer, consistently leading in down-gauging initiatives in cans and ends,
including innovations such as the OptiLift closing system, the lightest end in the world. These innovations

appeal to our customers, as they enhance the end-user experience, reduce metal consumption and
facilitate brand differentiation. Further, the Ardagh Carve-out Business holds more than 50 patents.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business has expanded its footprint through strategic investments in new
capacity including, in 2015, the completion of approximately $220 million in can-making facilities in
Roanoke, Virginia and Reno, Nevada, as well as a significant expansion of our Conklin, New York, ends
plant to meet substantially all the U.S. food can requirements of a major U.S. customer pursuant to a
long-term contract. These initiatives, as well as other investments over many years, in existing and adjacent
end use categories, have increased our scale and diversification and provided opportunities to grow our
business with both existing and new customers.

**Business Drivers**

The main factors affecting the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ results of operations are: (i) global
economic trends and end-consumer demand for our products; (ii) prices of raw material and energy used
in our business, primarily tinplate steel and aluminum, and our ability to pass-through these and other cost
increases to our customers, through contractual pass-through mechanisms under multi-year contracts, or
through renegotiation in the case of short-term contracts; (iii) investment in operating cost reductions; and
(iv) foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency translation risks arising from various currency
exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, U.S. dollar, British pound, Polish zloty and Danish krone. In
addition, certain other factors affect the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ revenue and operating profit/(loss).

The Ardagh Carve-out Business generates its revenue from supplying metal containers to a wide
range of primarily consumer-driven end use categories. Revenue is primarily dependent on sales volumes
and sales prices.

Sales volumes are influenced by a number of factors, including factors driving customer demand,
seasonality and the capacity of the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ plants. Demand for our metal containers
may be influenced by vegetable and fruit harvests, seafood catches, trends in the consumption of food,
trends in the use of consumer products, industry trends in packaging, including marketing decisions, the
impact of increasing sustainability awareness and changes in environmental regulations. The size and
quality of harvests and catches vary from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather in the
regions in which the Ardagh Carve-out Business operates. The food can industry is seasonal in nature, with
strongest demand during the end of the summer, coinciding with the harvests. Accordingly, the Ardagh
Carve-out Business’ volume of containers shipped is typically highest in the second and third quarters and
lowest in the first and fourth quarters. Accordingly, the Ardagh Carve-out Business generally builds
inventories in the first quarter in anticipation of the seasonal demands.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business generates the majority of its earnings from operations during the
second and third quarters. Ardagh Carve-out Business’ Adjusted EBITDA is based on revenue derived
from selling our metal containers and is affected by a number of factors, primarily cost of sales. The
elements of the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ cost of sales include (i) variable costs, such as electricity, raw
materials (including the cost of tinplate steel and aluminum), packaging materials, decoration and freight
and other distribution costs, and (ii) fixed costs, such as labor and other plant-related costs, including
depreciation, maintenance and sales, marketing and administrative costs. The Ardagh Carve-out Business’
variable costs have typically constituted approximately 80% of the total cost of sales for our metal
containers manufacturing business.

_Revenue_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ revenue decreased by $17 million (3%) to $581 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $598 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The
decrease in revenue was primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix effects (including the impact of the
closure of a facility in North America) and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of $31 million,
offset by the pass-through to customers of higher input costs.

_Cost of sales_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ cost of sales decreased by $10 million (2%) to $485 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $495 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The decrease in cost of sales is due mainly to lower volume/mix effects, lower other operating costs, the
impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 ‘‘Leasing,’’ lower exceptional cost of sales of $5 million and favorable
currency translation effects, partially offset by higher input costs. Further analysis of the movement in
exceptional items is set out in note 4 to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Unaudited Interim Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Sales, general and administration expenses_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ sales, general and administration expenses decreased by $2 million
(5%) to $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $37 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in sales, general and administration expenses was primarily
due to favorable currency translation effects.

_Net finance expense_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ net finance expense increased by $1 million (9%) to $12 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $11 million for the three months ended March 31,
2018. The increase in net finance expense was primarily due to an increase in other finance expense of
$2 million, including additional finance expense of $1 million related to lease liabilities, partially offset by a
decrease in net pension interest cost of $1 million.

_Income tax charge_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ income tax charge decreased by $1 million (8%) to $11 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $12 million for the three months ended March 31,
2018. The decrease in income tax charge was primarily due to lower profit before tax.

_Profit for the period_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ profit for the period decreased by $5 million (14%) to $31 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $36 million for the three months ended March 31,
2018. The decrease in profit for the period was primarily due to the factors described above.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $8 million (8%) to $87 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $95 million for the three months ended March 31,
2018. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix effects as
mentioned above, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, higher input costs offset by lower other
operating costs and the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 ‘‘Leasing.’’

**_Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017_**

_Revenue_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ revenue increased by $215 million (10%) to $2,421 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2,206 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
increase in revenue was primarily due to the pass-through to customers of higher input costs, favorable
foreign currency translation effects of $81 million, and favorable volume/mix effects.

_Cost of sales_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ cost of sales increased by $224 million (12%) to $2,047 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1,823 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
increase in cost of sales was primarily due to unfavorable currency translation effects, higher input and
other operating costs, partially offset by lower exceptional cost of sales. Exceptional cost of sales decreased
by $6 million, primarily reflecting $10 million lower property, plant and equipment impairment charges,
partially offset by a $3 million pension past service cost. Further analysis of the movement in exceptional
items is set out in note 4 to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out
Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

_Sales, general and administration expenses_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ sales, general and administration expenses decreased by $3 million
(3%) to $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $119 million for the year ended

for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The increase in intangible amortization was primarily due to the impact of additional annual amortization
charges on technology assets.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ net finance expense increased by $7 million (20%) to $42 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
increase in net finance expense was primarily due to higher interest on related party borrowings.

the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
decrease in income tax charge was primarily due to lower profit before tax for the year ended
December 31, 2018 and the impact of income taxed at rates other than standard tax rates.

_Profit for the year_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ profit for the year decreased by $2 million (1%) to $149 million for
the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The

the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The
decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher input costs offset by lower other operating
costs, favorable volume/mix effects, as mentioned above and favorable foreign currency translation effects
of $13 million.

ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2,150 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase
in revenue was primarily due to the pass-through to customers of higher input costs and favorable foreign
currency translation effects of $11 million offset by unfavorable volume/mix effects.

_Cost of sales_

The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ cost of sales increased by $22 million (1%) to $1,823 million for the
year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1,801 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The

**_Cash generated from/(used in) operating activities_**

Cash generated from operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2019 was nil,
representing a decrease of $19 million, compared to cash generated from operating activities of $19 million
in the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit for the period of $5 million and
higher outflows related to movements in working capital of $12 million. Net cash (used in)/from operating
activities was further impacted by higher interest paid of $1 million and higher income tax paid of
$2 million.

Cash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018, of $385 million
represents an increase of $47 million, compared to $338 million cash generated from operating activities in
the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher inflows related to movements in working
capital of $50 million. This increase was partially offset by higher interest paid of $14 million.

Cash generated from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, of $338 million
represents a decrease of $36 million, compared to $374 million cash generated from operations in the same
period in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher outflows related to movements in working capital
of $73 million, partially offset by higher profit before tax for the period of $37 million. Net cash from

83


-----

operating activities was further impacted by lower interest and income tax paid of $1 million and
$5 million, respectively.

_Net cash used in investing activities_

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $12 million to $40 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2019, compared to $28 million in the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased capital
expenditures related to the timing of capital investments and to the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ short
payback capital expenditure program, which deployed additional funding in relation to a number of
specific investment initiatives which offered attractive payback periods.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $16 million to $108 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, compared to $92 million in the same period in 2017 primarily due to increased capital
expenditures related to the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ short payback projects as described above in
addition to increased capital expenditures relating to intangible asset investments in the Ardagh Carve-out
Business’ information technology of $11 million.

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $27 million to $92 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017, compared to $65 million in the same period in 2016 primarily due to the timing of
capital expenditure cash outflows related to investments in the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ program of
continuous improvement initiatives, including the carry forward impact related to a number of projects
initiated in year ended December 31, 2016.

_Net inflow/(outflow) from financing activities_

Net cash from financing activities represented an inflow of $51 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2019 compared to a $21 million inflow in the same period in 2018 primarily due to $31 million
additional cash received from the Ardagh Group.

Net cash from financing activities represented an outflow of $229 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018 compared to a $224 million outflow in the same period in 2017 primarily due to
$9 million additional cash remitted to the Ardagh Group, partially offset by $4 million proceeds from
borrowings.

Net cash from financing activities represented an outflow of $224 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017 compared to a $332 million outflow in the same period in 2016 due to $108 million
lower cash remitted to the Ardagh Group.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business prepares the Ardagh Carve-out Business Annual Audited Combined
Carve-out Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. A summary of significant
accounting policies is contained in Note 2 to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined
Carve-out Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In applying many
accounting principles, the Ardagh Carve-out Business makes assumptions, estimates and judgments which
are often subjective and may be affected by changing circumstances or changes in the analysis performed.
Material changes in these assumptions, estimates and judgments have the potential to materially alter the
results of operations. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed
below.

**_Estimated impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets_**

In accordance with IAS 36 ‘‘Impairment of assets’’ (‘‘IAS 36’’), the Ardagh Carve-out Business tests
whether goodwill and other long-lived assets have suffered any impairment in accordance with the

84


-----

accounting policies stated. The determination of the recoverable amounts of goodwill requires the use of
estimates as outlined in note 8 of the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out
Financial Statements. The judgments made by the Ardagh Carve-out Business relating to the impairment
of goodwill and other long-lived assets are included in notes 8 and 9 of the Ardagh Carve-out Business
Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements.

**_Establishing lives for the purposes of depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and_**
**_intangibles_**

Long-lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, customer intangibles and
technology intangibles, comprise a significant portion of the total assets of the Ardagh Carve-out Business.
The annual depreciation and amortization charges depend primarily on the estimated lives of each type of
asset and, in certain circumstances, estimates of fair values and residual values. The board of directors
regularly review these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect current thinking on remaining
lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilization and physical condition of the assets
concerned. Changes in asset lives can have a significant impact on the depreciation and amortization
charges for the period. It is not practical to quantify the impact of changes in asset lives on an overall basis,
as asset lives are individually determined and there are a significant number of asset lives in use.

**_Income taxes_**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and judgment is
therefore required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions
and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of
business. The Ardagh Carve-out Business recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit matters based on
estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different
from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax
provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

**_Measurement of employee benefit obligations_**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business follows guidance of IAS 19(R) to determine the present value of its
obligations to current and past employees in respect of defined benefit pension obligations, other
long-term employee benefits, and other end of service employee benefits which are subject to similar
fluctuations in value in the long-term. The Ardagh Carve-out Business values its liabilities, with the
assistance of professional actuaries, to ensure consistency in the quality of the key assumptions underlying
the valuations. The critical assumptions and estimates applied are discussed in detail in note 18 of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements.

**_Exceptional items_**

The combined income statement and segment analysis separately identify results before exceptional
items. Exceptional items are those that, in our judgment, need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature
or incidence.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business believes that this presentation provides additional analysis as it
highlights exceptional items. The determination of ‘‘significant’’ as included in our definition uses
qualitative and quantitative factors which remain consistent from period to period. The Ardagh Carve-out
Business uses judgment in assessing the particular items which, by virtue of their scale and nature, are
disclosed in the combined income statement and related notes as exceptional items. Management
considers the combined income statement presentation of exceptional items to be appropriate as it
provides useful additional information and is consistent with the way that financial information is
measured by and presented to management. In that regard, management believes it to be consistent with

85


-----

paragraph 85 of IAS 1 ‘‘Presentation of Financial Statements’’ (‘‘IAS 1’’), which permits the inclusion of
line items and subtotals that improve the understanding of performance.

**_Revenue recognition_**

Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service has transferred to the customer. For certain
contracts, the Ardagh Carve-out Business manufactures products for customers that have no alternative
use and for which the Ardagh Carve-out Business has an enforceable right to payment for production
completed to date. The determination of goods or contracts having no alternative use and the enforceable
right to payment involves and relies upon management judgment, and can result in the Ardagh Carve-out
Business accelerating the recognition of revenue over time as the Ardagh Carve-out Business satisfies the
contractual performance obligations for those contracts.

**_Business combinations and goodwill_**

Goodwill only arises in business combinations. The amount of goodwill initially recognized is
dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based, to a
considerable extent, on management’s judgment. Allocation of the purchase price affects the results of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business as finite lived intangible assets are amortized, whereas indefinite lived
intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized and could result in differing amortization charges
based on the allocation to indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets.

**_Minority shareholders_**

Approximately 0.01% of the share capital of Ardagh MP Group France S.A. is owned by an outside
party.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

**_Capital Risk_**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business does not have its own treasury function. Treasury and financial risk
management is carried out by the Ardagh Group’s central treasury function under policies approved by the
board of directors of the Ardagh Group. As described in note 2 of the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited
Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, the related party borrowings reported within those
financial statements comprise intercompany debt from the Ardagh Group. The debt of the Ardagh
Carve-out Business in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial
Statements has fixed interest rates and, as such, the Ardagh Carve-out Business is not exposed to variable
interest rate risk.

The objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ ability to
continue as a going concern and provide returns to its owners.

Financial risks are managed on an ongoing basis, by the Ardagh Group’s central treasury function and
senior management team. The Ardagh Group does not permit the use of treasury instruments for
speculative purposes, under any circumstances. Ardagh central group treasury regularly reviews the level of
cash and debt facilities required to fund the activities of the Ardagh Carve-out Business, repayments and
financing of related party debt obligations, and identify an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a
reserve against unexpected funding requirements.

**_Currency exchange risk_**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business presents its combined financial information in U.S. dollars.

86


-----

The Ardagh Carve-out Business operates in 20 countries, across four continents and its main currency
exposure in the year to December 31, 2018, from the euro functional currency, was in relation to the U.S.
dollar, British pound, Polish zloty and Danish krone. Currency exchange risk arises from future
commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities.

As a result of the combined financial statements being presented in U.S. dollars, the results of the
Ardagh Carve-out Business are also impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the
euro.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business has a limited level of transactional currency exposure arising from
sales or purchases by operating units in currencies other than their functional currencies.

Fluctuations in the value of these currencies with respect to the euro currency may have a significant
impact on the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ financial condition and results of operations. The Ardagh
Carve-out Business believes that a strengthening of the euro exchange rate by 1% against all other foreign
currencies from the December 31, 2018, rate would decrease invested capital by approximately $5 million
(2017: $5 million, 2016: $5 million).

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business is exposed to changes in prices of its main raw materials, primarily
energy, tinplate steel and aluminum.

The majority of the tinplate steel purchases of the Ardagh Carve-out Business are obtained under
one-year contracts with prices that are usually fixed in advance. When such contracts are renewed in the
future, our tinplate steel costs under such contracts will be subject to prevailing global steel and/or tinplate
steel prices at the time of renewal, which may be different from historical prices.

The hedging market for iron ore, and in particular that for coking coal, is a relatively new market
which does not have the depth of the aluminum market and, as a consequence, there might be limitations
to placing hedges in the market. Aluminum ingot is traded daily as a commodity on the London Metal
Exchange, which has historically been subject to significant price volatility. Because aluminum is priced in
U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/euro rate also affect the euro cost of aluminum ingot. The price
and foreign currency risk on the aluminum purchases in the operations are hedged by entering into swaps
under which the Ardagh Carve-out Business pays fixed euro prices. Furthermore, the relative price of oil
and its by-products may materially impact the Ardagh Carve-out Business, affecting our transport, lacquer
and ink costs.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business uses derivative agreements to manage some of the material cost risk.
The Ardagh Carve-out Business depends on an active liquid market and available credit lines with
counterparty banks to cover this risk. The use of derivative contracts to manage its risk is dependent on
robust hedging procedures. Increasing raw material costs over time has the potential, if it is unable to pass
on price increases, to reduce sales volume and could therefore have a significant impact on its financial
condition. The Ardagh Carve-out Business is also exposed to possible interruptions of supply of steel and
aluminum or other raw materials and any inability to purchase raw materials could negatively impact its
operations.

As a result of the volatility of gas and electricity prices, the Ardagh Carve-out Business has either
included energy pass-through clauses in its sales contracts or developed an active hedging strategy to fix a
significant proportion of its energy costs through contractual arrangements directly with its suppliers,
where there is no energy clause in the sales contract.

Where pass-through contracts do not exist, the Ardagh Carve-out Business policy is to purchase gas
and electricity by entering into forward price-fixing arrangements with suppliers for the bulk of its
anticipated requirements for the year ahead. Such contracts are used exclusively to obtain delivery of its

87


-----

anticipated energy supplies. The Ardagh Carve-out Business does not net settle, nor does it sell within a
short period of time after taking delivery. The Ardagh Carve-out Business avails of the own-use exemption
and, therefore, these contracts are treated as executory contracts.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business typically builds up these contractual positions in tranches of
approximately 10% of the anticipated volumes. Any gas and electricity which is not purchased under
forward price-fixing arrangements is purchased under index tracking contracts or at spot prices.

**Credit Risk**

Credit risk of the Ardagh Carve-out Business has been managed by the Ardagh Group’s central
treasury function. Credit risk arises from derivative contracts, cash and deposits held with banks and
financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to the customers of the Ardagh Carve-out Business,
including outstanding receivables. The policy of the Ardagh Carve-out Business is to place excess liquidity
on deposit with the Ardagh central group treasury entity who will, in turn, only place excess liquid funds
with recognized and reputable financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only
independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘‘BBB+’’ from at least two credit rating agencies are
accepted, where possible. The credit ratings of banks and financial institutions are monitored to ensure
compliance with the Ardagh Group policy. Risk of default is controlled within a policy framework of
dealing with high quality institutions and by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one bank or
institution.

The policy of the Ardagh Carve-out Business is to extend credit to customers of good credit standing.
Credit risk is managed on an ongoing basis, by experienced people within the Ardagh Carve-out Business.
The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ policy for the management of credit risk in relation to trade receivables
involves periodically assessing the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial
position, past experience and other factors. Provisions are made, where deemed necessary, and the
utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. The Ardagh Carve-out Business does not expect any
significant counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented
by the carrying amount of each asset. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the ten largest customers of
the Ardagh Carve-out Business accounted for approximately 35% of total revenues (2017: 39%; 2016:
40%). There is no recent history of default with these customers.

**Liquidity Risk**

The Ardagh Carve-out Business is exposed to liquidity risk which arises primarily from the maturing
of short-term and long-term debt obligations. The Ardagh Group’s policy has been to ensure that sufficient
resources are available either from cash balances, cash flows or undrawn committed bank facilities, to
ensure all obligations can be met as they fall due. The liquidity risk of the Ardagh Carve-out Business is
managed centrally by the Ardagh Group’s central group treasury function.

To effectively manage liquidity risk, the Ardagh Group:

   - has committed borrowing facilities that it can access to meet liquidity needs;

   - maintains cash balances and liquid investments with highly-rated counterparties;

   - limits the maturity of cash balances;

   - borrows the bulk of its debt needs under long-term fixed rate debt securities; and

   - has internal control processes to manage liquidity risk.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Ardagh Group and is aggregated by
the Ardagh Group’s central treasury function. The Ardagh Group central treasury monitors rolling
forecasts of the Ardagh Group’s liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational
needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so
that the Ardagh Group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants on any of its borrowing facilities.
Such forecasting takes into consideration the Ardagh Group’s debt financing plans.

**Exal**

Exal is primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling extruded aluminum containers
to fit the specifications of customers in various industries in North and South America. In conducting this
business, Exal leverages its technical capabilities to innovate new design allowing customers to enhance
their brand and provide optimal functionality, primarily in the beauty and personal care, premium
beverage and food end use categories. Exal does business primarily in the United States, Brazil and
Argentina, and maintains holding companies in The Netherlands.

In 2018, Exal had five facilities, located in the United States, Argentina and Brazil and had
approximately 1,000 employees producing aluminum aerosols and aluminum bottles with revenue of
$288 million in 2018. Exal has strong market share in diverse businesses. Specifically, in 2018, Exal believes
that it had a #1 or #2 market position in each of those businesses in the aluminum segment of the aerosol
market that it serves in both North and South America.

Exal believes it is positioned for strong continued growth driven by market demands. Exal’s Brazilian
market is experiencing strong underlying growth and Exal expects a high portion of conversions to aerosol
from tin and plastic in the beauty and personal care market. In North America, Exal sees itself at the
forefront of growing the aluminum aerosol segment, which is highly under-penetrated in relation to other
developed regions, such as Europe. In both markets, Exal sees the underlying consumer trends of
premiumization and sustainability as a key component of aluminum’s value proposition. Finally, Exal’s
production pipeline of more than one billion units supports the strong demand growth in each of these
markets.

Exal is a strategic partner to blue-chip, global CPG companies. Exal has long-standing relationships
with eight of its top customers that stretch back more than ten years and are supported by strong contracts
which include take-or-pay agreements and account for the majority of volume in South America.

Exal also has an exceptional financial profile, with a demonstrated track record of profitable growth
and margin-expansion with industry-leading EBITDA margins and free cash flow conversion.

Exal has numerous competitive advantages. In South America, its competitive advantage is based on
its upstream vertical integration into slug manufacturing in Madryn, Argentina, which provides a strong
cost and quality advantage. Built in 2014, the slug plant in Madryn supplies all of Exal’s Argentina and
Brazil slug needs. The Madryn plant provides Exal with a consistent long-term supply of high quality slugs
to support Exal’s growth in South America and enables Exal to opportunistically sell slugs to third parties.
Moreover, the Madryn plant allows Exal to produce proprietary alloys to be used in innovative lightweight
products. Production of slugs in the Madryn plant fulfills all of Exal’s needs for high-quality slugs in South
America.

Another aspect of Exal’s competitive advantages is its strong asset base, which has continuously been
the beneficiary of investment since 2013. For example, approximately $45 million was invested in a
greenfield slug manufacturing in South America for vertical integration, which has created a low-cost
position. Moreover, this facility uses high-quality raw materials and creates the ability to achieve further
light-weighting of its products. Additionally, Exal has invested approximately $95 million in a greenfield
Brazil aerosol can facility with six manufacturing lines. There have been other major investments, including
investment in a new line in Argentina in 2018 and in upgrading multiple lines in North America, which has
created advanced global shaping capability.

Exal believes it is viewed as a leader in innovation and is a value-added partner to its customers,
providing them with valuable solutions. Exal benefits from a talented management team and a dynamic
culture. Exal’s proven management team has a track record of value creation. Since the beginning of 2016,
Exal has brought new talent into 27 of 37 management positions.

Exal has a proven business system approach, using a common operating language and value creation
approach providing the tools, processes and capabilities to the Exal organization in order to achieve
excellence in core business capabilities through best-in-class execution of fundamental business processes.
The business system approach is driven by four performance and capability engines: i) commercial
excellence in marketing, pricing, contract, customer and sales force management, customer service and
product development; ii) supply chain excellence in sourcing and procurement, sales and operational
planning, inventory, network optimization, delivery service (OTIF) and value engineering; iii) operational
excellence in safety, quality, cost, maintenance and lean processes; and iv) financial excellence in accounts
receivable, accounts payable, cash and foreign exchange management and debt levels and compliance. The
performance and capability engines are founded on the elements of people, capital assets and performance
management, each with clear targets, cascading KPIs and harmonized reporting.

Adjusted EBITDA increased from $66 million in 2016 to $80 million in 2018.

**Business Drivers**

The main factors affecting Exal’s results of operations are (i) global economic trends and
end-consumer demand for our products; (ii) sustainability; (iii) input costs; (iv) foreign exchange rate
fluctuations and (v) the ongoing repositioning of the Exal business.

A key global economic trend is the premiumization of aluminum consumer goods packaging to align
with premium, differentiated customer-facing brands, by way of superior graphics and printing, shaping,
with better functionality such as lightweight products, with strong barrier and anti-rust properties.
Additional global economic trends are SKU proliferation and demand for convenience products, such as
reclosable bottles and smaller pack sizes (which are a cost-competitive alternative to tin-based products).

Moreover, aluminum-based packaging is environmentally sustainable. Not only is aluminum infinitely
recyclable, but it also has high recycling rates. Additionally, the creation of recycled aluminum uses less
than 10% of the energy required to create primary aluminum. Aluminum’s properties position it to benefit
from the increasing backlash against the use of plastic products.

Another main factor affecting Exal’s results of operations are input costs, specifically the cost of
aluminum. Exal’s pricing structure allows it to pass-through cost changes to customers. A large portion of
Exal’s volumes are provided via contracts providing for nearly full pass-through on aluminum and other
costs.

Foreign exchange rate fluctuations, particularly those in South America, affect Exal’s operations. Exal
currently benefits from a degree of contractual foreign exchange protection from its existing customers,
and is currently in the process of enhancing that protection for a significant portion of its business in
Argentina.

Since 2015, the Exal business has repositioned itself from a focus on the mass beverage market in
North America to premium, high-value niches in aluminum aerosols and aluminum bottles, while
continuing to invest in growth opportunities in South America. This repositioning has been enhanced by an
improved focus on commercial and operational excellence. In parallel, since 2013, Exal has invested over
$140 million in the Brazilian aerosol can manufacturing and the Madryn slug manufacturing facilities in
support of customers’ growing demand for aluminum aerosol packaging.

**_Three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to three months ended March 31, 2018_**

_Revenues_

Exal’s revenues decreased by $5 million (6.6%) to $71 million for the three months ended March 31,
2019 compared to $76 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in revenues was
primarily due to lower Argentina aerosol volume as well as lower volumes at our Argentina filling facility
due to softness in the Argentine economy. These decreases were partially offset by significant growth in
Brazil aerosol volume. Revenue in North America was stable year over year, as lower volumes were offset
by a favorable product mix.

_Cost of goods sold_

Exal’s cost of goods sold decreased by $4 million (8.0%) to $46 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 compared to $50 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in cost
of goods sold was primarily due to lower volumes in Argentina and the United States, partially offset by
volume growth in Brazil and continued improvements in operating efficiencies in South America.

_Selling, general and administrative cost_

Exal’s selling, general and administrative cost increased by $1 million (16.7%) to $7 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.
The increase in selling, general and administrative cost was driven by investments in management in the
current year.

92


-----

_Depreciation and amortization_

Exal’s depreciation and amortization was broadly stable at $7 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, despite additional capital
investments to add capacity and improve operating efficiency.

_Other expenses_

Exal’s other expenses increased by $1 million (33.3%) to $4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 compared to $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in other
expenses was primarily due to higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses on Exal’s net asset
position in Argentina as the Argentine peso weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar in the current
period. This increase was partially offset by lower South American financial taxes in the current period.

_Insurance claim income, net_

Exal’s insurance claim income was zero for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to net
insurance income of $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net insurance
claim income was primarily due to the fact that all insurance recoveries related to the Exal Packaging fire
and the Madryn equipment malfunction were finalized during 2018.

_Operating income_

Exal’s operating income decreased by $5 million (41.7%) to $7 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 compared to $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in
operating income was primarily due to $2 million of insurance income, net, that was recognized in the prior
year as well as higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses on Exal’s net asset position in Argentina
in the current period.

_Interest expense_

Exal’s interest expense was stable at $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared
to the three months ended March 31, 2018 as lower amortization of deferred financing fees and lower
outstanding debt balances in the three months ended March 31, 2019 were largely offset by higher average
interest rates on outstanding debt.

_Income before taxes_

Exal’s income before taxes decreased by $5 million (55.6%) to $4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2019 compared to $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in
income before taxes was primarily due to $2 million of insurance income, net, that was recognized in the
prior year as well as higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses on Exal’s net asset position in
Argentina in the current period.

_Benefit from (provision for) income taxes_

Exal’s provision for income taxes decreased by $1 million (50.0%) to $1 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2019 compared to $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in
provision for income taxes was primarily due to a decrease in income before taxes, as well as the mix of
U.S. and foreign income before taxes.

_Net income_

Exal’s net income decreased by $4 million (57.1%) to $3 million for the three months ended March 31,
2019 compared to $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net income was

93


-----

primarily due to $2 million of insurance income, net, that was recognized in the prior year as well as higher
foreign currency remeasurement expenses in the current period, partially offset by a lower provision for
income taxes.

**_Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017_**

_Revenues_

Exal’s revenues increased by $16 million (5.9%) to $288 million for 2018 compared to $272 million for
2017. The increase in revenues was primarily due primarily driven by strong volume demand in North
America aerosol, partially offset by lower volumes in Exal’s Argentina filling facility.

_Cost of goods sold_

Exal’s cost of goods sold increased by $11 million (6.3%) to $186 million for 2018 compared to
$175 million for 2017. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the overall increase in
volume.

_Selling, general and administrative cost_

Exal’s selling, general and administrative cost was broadly stable at $26 million for 2018 compared to
2017, as cost pressure was offset by favorable foreign currency impacts in South America and lower
management incentive compensation.

_Depreciation and amortization_

Exal’s depreciation and amortization increased by $2 million (8.0%) to $27 million for 2018 compared
to $25 million for 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to capital
investments in equipment upgrades in North America and capacity expansion in South America.

_Transition and integration expenses_

Exal’s transition and integration expenses increased by $1 million (50.0%) to $3 million for 2018
compared to $2 million for 2017. The increase in transition and integration expenses was primarily due to
higher severance costs as Exal rationalized resources to align with expected volumes.

_Loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets_

Exal’s loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets increased by $4 million to $6 million for 2018
compared to $2 million for 2017. The increase in loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets was
primarily due to an impairment charge relating to three manufacturing lines in Exal’s North America
operations that had been taken out of service in previous years.

_Other expenses_

Exal’s other expenses increased by $9 million (56.3%) to $25 million for 2018 compared to $16 million
for 2017. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency
remeasurement in 2018 associated with Exal’s South America operations, principally driven by the
Argentina business, and higher transaction-related expenses in 2018. These increases were partially offset
by lower financial taxes in South America and lower provision for related-party debt.

_Insurance claim income, net_

Exal’s insurance claim income, net of $10 million for 2018 was primarily attributable to the recovery of
losses associated with the Exal Packaging fire and an equipment malfunction at Exal’s Madyrn facility.

94


-----

_Operating income_

Exal’s operating income decreased by $1 million (3.8%) to $25 million for 2018 compared to
$26 million for 2017. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher foreign currency
remeasurement expenses largely offset by higher net insurance claim income.

_Interest expense_

Exal’s interest expense increased by $1 million (9.1%) to $12 million for 2018 compared to $11 million
for 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to slightly higher interest rates in 2018
compared to 2017.

_Interest expense-related parties_

Exal’s interest expense-related parties decreased by $1 million to zero for 2018 compared to $1 million
for 2017. The decrease was due to refinancing of related party debt with long-term debt during 2017.

_Income before taxes_

Exal’s income before taxes decreased by $1 million (7.1%) to $13 million for 2018 compared to
$14 million for 2017. The decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to higher foreign currency
remeasurement expenses largely offset by higher insurance claim income, net and the refinancing of
related party debt with long-term debt.

_Benefit from (provision for) income taxes_

Exal’s benefit from (provision for) income taxes increased by $1 million to a benefit of $1 million for
2018 compared to a provision for zero for 2017. The increase in benefit from income taxes was primarily
due to the release of a valuation allowance associated with Exal’s Argentina slug manufacturing facility
which was merged into its Argentina can manufacturing facility during 2018, allowing Exal to utilize
previously reserved net operating losses as well as the mix of United States and foreign income before
taxes, partially offset by the deferred tax impact of lower tax rates enacted in the United States during
2017.

_Net income_

Exal’s net income was flat at $14 million for 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the factors
mentioned above.

**_Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016_**

_Revenues_

Exal’s revenues decreased by $2 million (0.7%) to $272 million for 2017 compared to $274 million for
2016. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease of volume in North American as Exal
transitioned away from the beverage market, largely offset by strong growth in aerosol volumes in both
North and South America.

_Cost of goods sold_

Exal’s cost of goods sold decreased by $10 million (5.4%) to $175 million for 2017 compared to
$185 million for 2016. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the lower volume as Exal
transitioned from the beverage market to the aerosol market, as well as initial results from Exal’s
production efficiency efforts.

95


-----

_Selling, general and administrative cost_

Exal’s selling, general and administrative cost increased by $2 million (8.3%) to $26 million for 2017
compared to $24 million for 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative cost was primarily
due to the transition to the current leadership team to support growth objectives, including consulting
support resources.

_Depreciation and amortization_

Exal’s depreciation and amortization increased by $1 million (4.2%) to $25 million for 2017 compared
to $24 million for 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to additional
capacity growth investments, most notably associated with Exal’s Brazil operations to capture volume
growth in this region.

_Transition and integration expenses_

Exal’s transition and integration expenses decreased by $2 million (50.0%) to $2 million for 2017
compared to $4 million for 2016. The decrease in transition and integration expenses was primarily due to
lower levels of separation benefits during 2017.

_Loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets_

Exal’s loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets decreased by $3 million (60.0%) to $2 million for
2017 compared to $5 million for 2016. The decrease in loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets was
primarily due to the impairment of manufacturing lines taken out of service in Exal’s North American
facility during 2016.

_Other expenses_

Exal’s other expenses increased by $10 million to $16 million for 2017 compared to $6 million for
2016. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher financial taxes in South America due to
significant capacity growth investments at Exal’s Brazilian operations, as well as higher foreign currency
remeasurement expenses.

_Operating income_

Exal’s operating income was $26 million for 2017 compared to $26 million for 2016. Operating income
increased primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as Exal transitioned from the beverage market to the
aerosol market, which was offset by higher South American financial taxes and higher foreign currency
remeasurement expenses.

_Interest expense_

Exal’s interest expense increased by $1 million (10.0%) to $11 million for 2017 compared to
$10 million for 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the write-off of unamortized
deferred financing fees associated with the refinancing of Exal’s outstanding debt, as well as an
approximately 60 basis point increase in interest rates during the year, partially offset by a reduction in
outstanding debt levels.

_Interest expense—related parties_

Exal’s interest expense—related parties decreased by $4 million (80.0%) to $1 million for 2017
compared to $5 million for 2016. The decrease in interest expense—related parties was primarily due to
the related party debt being extinguished during 2017.

-----

_Income before taxes_

Exal’s income before taxes increased by $3 million (27.2%) to $14 million for 2017 compared to
$11 million for 2016. The increase in income before taxes was primarily due lower net interest expenses
and higher operating income.

_Benefit from (provision for) income taxes_

Exal’s provision for income taxes was zero for 2017 compared to a provision for $8 million for 2016.
The decrease provision for income taxes was primarily due to the approximately $8.5 million one-time
benefit associated with the ‘‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’’ enacted in the U.S. during 2017.

_Net income_

Exal’s net income increased by $11 million to $14 million for 2017 compared to $3 million for 2016.
The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income before taxes and lower provision for
income taxes during 2017.

**_Cash provided by operating activities_**

Cash provided by operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2019, of $6 million
represents a decrease of $10 million, compared to $16 million net cash provided by operations in the same
period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income and higher investments in working

98


-----

capital during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and insurance recoveries received during the three
months ended March 31, 2018.

Cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2018, of $35 million represents
an increase of $1 million compared to $34 million net cash provided by operations in the same period in
2017 as higher cash operating results in 2017 were largely offset by higher working capital investments.

Cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, of $34 million represents
a decrease of $17 million, compared to $51 million net cash provided by operations in the same period in
2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher cash usage for working capital in 2017.

**_Net cash used for investing activities_**

Net cash used for investing activities decreased by $5 million to $3 million in the three months ended
March 31, 2019, compared to $8 million in the same period in 2018 due to lower capital spending in South
America in the current period, as the prior year period included capacity expansion projects and fire
recovery efforts that were completed in 2018.

Net cash used for investing activities increased by $1 million to $33 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018, compared to $32 million in the same period in 2017 due to higher capital spending on
capacity expansion projects in North America, offset by lower capital spending in South America where
significant capacity expansion projects were completed in 2017.

Net cash used for investing activities increased by $19 million to $32 million in the year ended
December 31, 2017, compared to $13 million in the same period in 2016 due to significant capacity
expansion projects in South America during 2017.

**_Net cash used for financing activities_**

Net cash used for financing activities was $4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019
compared to a $3 million outflow in the same period in 2018, an increase of $1 million, due to Exal’s focus
on incremental debt pay down in the current period.

Net cash used for financing activities was $1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared
to a $5 million in the same period in 2017, a decrease of $4 million, primarily due to expenses incurred to
refinance Exal’s outstanding debt in 2017.

Net cash used for financing activities was $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared
to a $47 million in the same period in 2016, a decrease of $42 million, due to significant pay downs on
Exal’s revolving credit facility and term loans in 2016.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to changes in facts and circumstances.

On an ongoing basis, Exal evaluates its estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable
allowance, reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, lower of cost or market conditions, useful lives of
long-lived assets (including intangible assets), carrying value of long-lived assets (including goodwill and
intangible assets), and the valuation of deferred income tax assets, as well as its assumptions to value its
workers’ compensation liabilities, the value of unit option plans and other related assumptions used for the

99


-----

purpose of determining stock-based compensation, among other things. Exal bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred,
price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Customers generally take
title and assume all the risks of ownership upon shipment.

**_Shipping and Handling Costs_**

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded as revenues and the related costs are
included as a component of cost of goods sold in Exal’s consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

Exal considers highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturity dates of three months
or less from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents and are valued at cost plus accrued interest,
which approximates fair value.

**_Receivables_**

Exal has established credit policies in evaluating its customers’ financial condition and, generally,
requires no collateral from its customers. The potential risk is limited to the amounts recorded in the
consolidated financial statements. Periodically, management reviews accounts receivable and adjusts the
allowance for doubtful accounts based on Exal’s historical losses, existing economic conditions and the
financial stability of its customers. Receivables are written off when they are determined to be
uncollectible, although collection efforts may continue.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out (‘‘FIFO’’) method)
or net realizable value. The cost of work in process and finished goods includes materials, labor and an
allocation of fixed overhead based on normal operating capacity. Provisions are made for potentially
obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on management’s analysis of inventory levels, historical usage,
future demand and market conditions.

**_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method. Major property categories are depreciated over various periods as follows (in years):

**Description** **Useful life**

Land improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 - 40
Buildings and improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 40
Machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 - 17

Exal capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property and equipment. The
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the
asset’s estimated useful life.

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (‘‘ASC’’) Topic 360, Property, Plant and
Equipment, Exal regularly assesses the carrying value of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including

100


-----

property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If such events or circumstances are
present, a loss is recognized to the extent the carrying values of the asset are in excess of estimated fair
value. Exal recorded impairment losses of $6 million and $5 million during the years ended December 31,
2018 and 2016, respectively, primarily related to certain manufacturing assets that were taken out of
service during 2016. No impairment loss was recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2019 or
2018 or the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Intangible Assets_**

Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships. The useful lives of intangible assets are
estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset. Amortization is provided using the straight-line
method over a useful life of 15 years.

**_Contingencies_**

From time-to-time during the ordinary course of business, Exal is threatened with, or may become a
party to, legal actions and other proceedings. Exal records a liability for such claims when an unfavorable
outcome of the matter is deemed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Legal
costs associated with these contingencies are recorded as incurred.

**_Income Taxes_**

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for
income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable
(or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred
taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Exal’s
assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are
enacted.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a
tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all
potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of
taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as
well as all available positive and negative evidence.

Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are
recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are
recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that either the appropriate taxing
authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open, or the
statute of limitation has expired. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as
part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and
penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are
recognized.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

Exal accounts for the fair value measurement of its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) ASC 820, which defines fair value as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date.

101


-----

FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, prioritizing observable and unobservable inputs used
to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:

   - Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are
accessible at the measurement date;

  - Level 2—inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly; and

   - Level 3—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement.

**_Stock-based Compensation_**

Exal’s Parent has a stock option plan with Exal’s management, employees and independent directors,
and the related stock-based compensation is reported as part of selling, general and administrative expense
in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The fair value associated with unit
option plans has been calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is recognized as
compensation expense over the requisite service period.

**_Foreign Currency Translation_**

The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which Exal’s foreign
subsidiary operates, except in countries with a history of high inflation. Management selects the functional
currency after evaluating the economic operating environment of its foreign subsidiaries. Exal’s operations
in Argentina and Brazil use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. All other foreign entities use the
local currency as the functional currency.

For the Exal’s operations in Brazil and Argentina, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency,
monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at current rates, non-monetary assets and liabilities are
remeasured at historical rates and revenues and expenses are remeasured at average rates on a monthly
basis throughout the year. Foreign currency transaction losses included in other expenses totaled
$4 million, $2 million, $19 million, $5 million, and $1 million, for the three months ended March 31, 2019
and 2018 and the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency are
translated using period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average
exchange rates on a monthly basis throughout the year. Translation gains and losses are reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income in partners’ equity.

**_Short-term Purchase Commitments_**

In an attempt to fix the cost of aluminum at a lower level, Exal Corporation, Exal’s North American
subsidiary, committed itself on a short-term basis to purchase specified quantities of aluminum slugs at
fixed prices from one supplier during 2018 and 2019. These contracts meet the normal purchases and
normal sales provision and are therefore not subject to be accounted for as derivatives under ASC 815. For
the years 2019 and 2018, these commitments totaled 2,017 and 2,913 metric tons of aluminum for
$6 million and $7 million, respectively.

102


-----

**_Non-cash Investing Activities_**

Machinery and equipment purchases of $3 million and $2 million were included in accounts payable at
March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Machinery and equipment purchases of $3 million, $3 million, and
$4 million were included in accounts payable at December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

**_Reclassifications_**

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Such
reclassifications had no effect on the accumulated deficit.

**_Research and Development_**

Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Substantially all engineering and
development costs are related to developing new products or designing significant improvements to
existing products or processes. Costs primarily include salaries and benefits, facility costs and outside
services.

**_New Accounting Policies Adopted by Exal_**

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, ‘‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities.’’ The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other changes, the
amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at
amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities. For non-public entities, the guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a
material impact on Exal’s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
(‘‘ASU 2016-09’’). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based
payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, though early adoption is permitted if all amendments are adopted in the same period. On January 1,
2018, Exal adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in Exal making
an accounting policy election to change how it recognizes the number of share-based payments that will
ultimately vest. In the past, Exal applied a forfeiture rate to shares granted. With the adoption of
ASU 2016-09, Exal recognizes forfeitures as they occur. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a
material impact on Exal’s results of operations or financial condition.

In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting (‘‘ASU 2017-09’’). ASU 2017-09 clarifies
when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as
modifications. The guidance also clarifies that a modification to an award could be significant and
therefore require disclosure, even if modification accounting is not required. ASU 2017-09 is effective for
annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. On
January 1, 2018, Exal adopted the provision of ASU 2017-09 on a prospective basis. The adoption of
ASU 2017-09 did not have an impact on Exal’s results of operations or financial condition.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, all of Exal’s external borrowings were variable rate with a weighted
average interest rate of 5.38% (2017: 4.61%; 2016: 4.05%). Exal had no related party borrowings at
December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Holding all other variables constant, including levels of Exal’s external indebtedness, at December 31,
2018 a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would increase interest payable by
approximately $1.7 million (2017: $1.7 million).

**_Currency Exchange Risk_**

Exal presents its consolidated financial information in U.S. dollars.

Exal operates in 3 countries, across two continents and its main currency exposure in the year ended
December 31, 2018, was in relation to the Argentine Peso and Brazilian R´eal. Currency exchange risk
arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign
operations.

Exal has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency
translation risk.

Fluctuations in the value of these currencies with respect to Exal’s U.S. dollar functional currency may
have a significant impact on Exal’s financial condition and results of operations. When considering Exal’s
position, Exal believes that a strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate (Exal’s functional currency) by
1% against all other foreign currencies from the December 31, 2018 rate would decrease shareholders’
equity by approximately $0.3 million (2017: $0.3 million).

**_Commodity Price Risk_**

Exal is exposed to changes in prices of our main raw materials, primarily aluminum.

The majority of Exal’s aluminum purchases are obtained on the spot market, with the majority of
Exal’s sales contracts allowing for the pass-through of material costs. Furthermore, the relative price of oil
and its byproducts may materially impact Exal’s business, affecting transportation, lacquer and ink costs.

Aluminum ingot is traded daily as a commodity (priced in U.S. dollars) on the London Metal
Exchange, which has historically been subject to significant price volatility.

Increasing raw material costs over time has the potential, if Exal is unable to pass on price increases,
to reduce sales volume and could therefore have a significant impact on its financial condition. Exal is also
exposed to possible interruptions of supply of steel and aluminum or other raw materials and any inability
to purchase raw materials could negatively impact Exal’s operations.

**Credit Risk**

Credit risk is managed on a group basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits
with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to Exal’s customers, including outstanding
receivables. Exal’s policy is to place excess liquidity on deposit, only with recognized and reputable
financial institutions.

The credit ratings of banks and financial institutions are monitored to ensure compliance with Exal’s
credit policy. Exal’s policy is to extend credit to customers of good credit standing. Credit risk is managed
on an ongoing basis by a designated team of experienced employees. Exal’s policy for the management of
credit risk in relation to trade receivables involves periodically assessing the financial reliability of

104


-----

customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Provisions are
made where deemed necessary and the utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. Management
does not expect any significant counterparty to fail to meets its obligations. The maximum exposure to
credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset. For the year ended December 31, 2018,
Exal’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 78% of total revenue (2017: 79%; 2016: 88%).
There is no recent history of default with these customers.

Surplus cash held by the operating entities over and above the balance required for working capital
management is transferred to Exal’s treasury. Exal’s treasury invests surplus cash in interest-bearing
current accounts and time deposits with appropriate maturities to provide sufficient headroom as
determined by the below-mentioned forecasts.

**Liquidity Risk**

Exal is exposed to liquidity risk which arises primarily from the maturing of short-term and long-term
debt obligations and derivative transactions. Exal’s policy is to ensure that sufficient resources are available
either from cash balances, cash flows or undrawn committed bank facilities to ensure all obligations can be
met as they fall due.

To effectively manage liquidity risk, Exal:

   - has committed borrowing facilities that we can access to meet liquidity needs;

   - maintains cash balances and liquid investments with highly-rated counterparties;

   - limits the maturity of cash balances;

   - borrows the bulk of its debt needs under long-term fixed rate debt securities; and

   - has internal control processes to manage liquidity risk.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of Exal and is aggregated by Exal’s
treasury. Exal’s treasury monitors rolling forecasts of our liquidity requirements to ensure Exal has
sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed
borrowing facilities at all times so that it does not breach borrowing limits or covenants on any of its
borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration Exal’s debt financing plans, covenant
compliance and compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets.

can-making facilities in Roanoke, Virginia and Reno, Nevada, as well as a significant expansion of our
Conklin, New York, ends plant; positioning us to meet substantially all the metal packaging requirements
of a major U.S. CPG company pursuant to a long-term contract; (ii) the material enhancement of our
South American aerosol production capabilities and capacity to serve growing demand in that region,
including the completion of a new state-of-the-art aluminum slug production facility; and (iii) consistent
investment in our European business in pursuit of growth opportunities in selected end use categories,
including the infant formula/nutrition market, where demand growth is driven by emerging market
consumption, and in single-serve pet food formats, where convenience and a trend to premium products is
evident. These initiatives, as well as other acquisitions and investments over many years, in both existing
and adjacent end use categories, have increased our scale and diversification and provided opportunities to
grow our business with existing and new customers.

We are committed to maintaining the industry leading innovation history of both the Ardagh
Carve-out Business and Exal. To this end, we focus on four main areas of R&D: (i) innovations that
provide improved product design, differentiation and usability; (ii) innovations that reduce metal content
to generate cost savings (down-gauging); (iii) developments to meet evolving food safety standards and
regulations; and (iv) innovations that address consumers’ preference for sustainable packaging by allowing
our customers to migrate to metal as a packaging material. Our worldwide manufacturing footprint is
supported by a dedicated R&D center in France, which has developed numerous award-winning
innovations and solutions for our customers over many years.

On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Combination, revenue and Pro Forma Supplemental
Adjusted EBITDA for Trivium for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019 would have been
$2,687 million and $469 million, respectively. We also expect the Combination to create Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA net benefits of approximately $40 million over the next few years through the pursuit of
commercial and operational excellence initiatives across Trivium’s business.

solutions in nutrition cans to offer greater brand differentiation, enhanced hygiene features and
tamper-proof protection, as well as new offerings in single-serve packaging for a wide variety of
applications. Our product offerings also address and promote the secular shift from steel to
aluminum aerosols in the Americas and the potential growth of new premium beverage applications
for aluminum bottles, including beer, wines and ready-to-drink coffees.

   - Consistently strong financial profile. We have an attractive financial profile highlighted by consistently
strong Adjusted EBITDA in each of our two businesses and robust free cash flow generation. Our
attractive combined financial performance is underpinned by our recurring sales into stable end use
categories that have select attractive growth opportunities, our demonstrated ability to pass through
changes in raw material prices to our customers and our consistent track record of delivering cost
savings and moderate maintenance capital expenditure requirements anticipated to be
approximately $40 million annually. These factors culminate in an attractive and consistent free
cash flow profile, which we expect will enable us to reduce leverage through debt repayment and
Adjusted EBITDA growth over time. Further, each of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal
have a demonstrable track record of Adjusted EBITDA growth with a CAGR of 3.3% and 10.1%,
respectively from 2016 to 2018.

   - Proven leadership team focused on value creation supported by long-term focused shareholders. We have

110


-----

  - Provide sustainable packaging solutions. We will continue to work with our customers to provide
innovative and sustainable packaging solutions to meet their own ambitious environmental and
sustainability objectives and commitments. Metal is the most recycled packaging material globally
and can be infinitely recycled without any degradation in quality. We expect to leverage these
attributes of metal packaging to develop new applications, including those arising from conversion
from other packaging formats. Our dedicated R&D capabilities mean that we are well-positioned to
capitalize on such pack-mix shifts, given our sole focus on sustainable packaging solutions.

   - Enhance product mix and profitability. Backed by our scale and record of innovation, we intend to
grow our business with existing and new customers. Working in partnership with our customers, we
intend to build on our existing leadership positions in our businesses. We also intend to pursue
selective growth opportunities across our product portfolio by offering packaging solutions that
address needs or desires for sustainability, brand differentiation, customer convenience/usability
and regulatory change. Coupled with our continued focus on streamlining our cost base and
optimizing our efficiency, we are targeting an enhanced product mix and increased profitability over

   - Apply operational excellence and technical expertise. In managing our businesses, we seek to improve
our safety and efficiency, as well as controlling our costs to preserve and expand our margins. We
have consistently optimized our cost base through streamlining our manufacturing footprint and
investing in advanced technology to enhance our production capacity. We intend to continue
increasing our productivity through the deployment of leading technology across our manufacturing
footprint, including our innovation and design capabilities and development and sharing of best
practices and know-how across our operations.

**_Reasons for the Combination_**

We believe that the combination of the complementary Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal to form a
leading metal packaging provider offers attractive opportunities for future growth, as we continue to serve
our customers’ desire for high-quality, innovative and sustainable solutions in support of their brands. Our
ability to service customers across a broader range of geographies represents a significant potential benefit.
We are well positioned to pursue attractive secular growth opportunities with our well-invested asset base,
where we have spent in excess of $350 million on new production facilities since 2013.

We believe in the highly complementary fit of our businesses, with no geographic overlap in end use
categories served. Our Company has an attractive and diversified material mix, encompassing
approximately 70% tinplate steel and 30% aluminum product offerings, to deliver differentiated and
premiumized solutions to meet customer needs. Moreover, the Combination will provide for
diversification in terms of product, end market, customers and geography. Further, we continuously
support product and process innovations, as well as sustainability initiatives, with our dedicated research
and development center.

Although we operate in relatively mature industries, we have identified attractive growth
opportunities in the regions and end use categories which we serve. Overall, we believe metal packaging is
positioned to benefit from the accelerating focus on sustainability. Attractive growth opportunities include
the potential for further penetration of lighter-weight two-piece food cans in North America, increasing
demand for single-serve products in end use categories such as pet food and seafood, the shift from
tinplate steel to aluminum aerosol containers in North America, growth in aerosol markets in South
America and growth in the nutrition end use category.

We believe we have an attractive financial profile characterized by stability and underpinned by
resilient product demand, longstanding relationships with customers with whom we generally have
long-term contracts with pass-through provisions. Our well-invested asset base enjoys a low-cost profile

111


-----

and, in conjunction with our relatively low level of maintenance capital expenditures, lead to a high level of
cash conversion in our business.

We also see significant scope to enhance performance through the sharing of best practices across all
aspects of our combined business. We believe that the business system approach applied by Exal in recent
years, which yielded an improvement of over 1,000 basis points in Adjusted EBITDA for the period 2015
(17.8% Adjusted EBITDA margin) to 2018 (27.9% Adjusted EBITDA margin), can deliver significant
benefits to our enlarged business over the medium term. This will involve the implementation of
commercial and operational optimization initiatives across our business, including continuous
benchmarking of process and performance, business mix enhancement, accelerating growth and innovation
opportunities, complexity reduction, a focus on value over volume and targeted investments, including in
automation to drive efficiency, quality and cost performance. We have identified commercial and
operational excellence opportunities which are expected over the next few years to generate approximately
$40 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA net benefit. We expect to realize these net benefits after
targeted investments in our selling, general and administrative cost base.

**_Industry Overview_**

The global packaging industry is a large, consumer-driven industry with stable growth characteristics.
We operate in the metal container sectors and our target regions are Europe, North America and South
America. Metal containers are attractive to brand owners, as their strength and rigidity allows them to be
filled at high speeds and easily transported, while their shelf-stable nature means that refrigeration is not
required, thereby resulting in further energy savings in the supply chain. The ability to customize and
differentiate products supplied in metal containers, through innovative design, shaping and printing, also
appeals to our customers. The metal container market has been marked by progressive down-gauging,
which has generated material savings in input costs and logistics, while enhancing the consumer
experience. This reduction in raw material and energy usage in the manufacturing process has also
increased the appeal to end-users, who are increasingly focused on sustainability.

Metal can packaging is approximately a $55 billion global revenue industry that is comprised of
beverage cans (45% of the market), food (including seafood) cans (30%) and other cans (25%), according
to Smithers Pira, a leading independent market research firm.

Despite competition from other formats and materials, metal cans remain a key food packaging
format, owing to their attractive value proposition. The use of metal cans as a food packaging format is
expected to have modest but stable growth of 0.6% per annum, for the next few years, principally driven by
macroeconomic growth, as forecasted by Smithers Pira. Global sales of aerosol cans continue to increase,
driven by rising demand for beauty and personal care and household products. Growing levels of
disposable income and a focus on convenience, together with a shift in material mix from tinplate steel to
aluminum are among the factors which will drive future aerosols demand, according to Smithers Pira.
Other cans is a diverse market segment encompassing a wide variety of metal packaging containers serving
end user applications, such as nutrition, beer kegs for at-home use and paints and coatings. This market
segment benefits from multiple drivers of demand, including convenience and sustainability. Collectively,
North America, Latin America and Europe constitute 79% of the global food end use category by revenue
and 52% of the ‘‘other’’ end use category by revenue, according to Smithers Pira.

We believe the purchasing decisions of retail consumers are significantly influenced by packaging.
Consumer product manufacturers and marketers increasingly use packaging to position their products in
the market and differentiate them on retailers’ shelves. The development and production of premium,
specialized packaging products with a combination of value-added features requires a high level of design
capability, manufacturing and process know-how and quality control to consistently produce lightweight
products, with strong barrier and anti-rust properties. Additional industry trends such as SKU proliferation
and demand for convenience products, such as reclosable bottles, which are a cost-competitive alternative

112


-----

to tinplate based products for smaller pack sizes, also provide opportunities for selective growth in new and
emerging end use categories.

Metal packaging offers performance and convenience for CPG companies compared to alternatives. It
acts as a superior barrier to oxygen and light and is resilient, as it can be unbreakable, tamper-proof and
fire and temperature resistant. Moreover, it is convenient, and can be lighter or more robust, with portable
characteristics and easy open and recloseable solutions. When used in the food market, metal has the
advantage of retaining nutritional value, without the requirement for preservatives. From a supply chain
perspective, metal packaging allows for efficient transportation and storage and is suited to processing on
installed high-speed filling lines and retort processes.

From a sustainability perspective, metal is the most recycled material globally and can be infinitely
recycled without any degradation in quality. Metal packaging is officially endorsed as a preferred material
by the E.U. and, with a growing awareness among end consumers of sustainability issues, has added appeal
to brand owners in helping to meet their own ambitious sustainability goals and commitments.

The metal packaging industry benefits from the stability of its end use categories, with selective
opportunities for attractive growth. Metal packaging represents a proven value proposition for CPG
companies and it is a stable technology with minimal substitution risk.

The European food can sector is a large, mature industry with approximately 24 billion food cans
produced in 2018, according to Smithers Pira. It is characterized by lightweight three-piece and two-piece
cans with easy open or peelable ends that are often decorated with high quality printed graphics and other
innovative designs. End use categories served include food, vegetables, fruit, pet food, seafood, ready
meals and soups. Despite competition from other packaging formats, this sector is characterized by a high
degree of stability, with a significant installed base of customer filling lines dedicated to filling metal
packaging. The food metal can packaging industry in Europe has selective growth opportunities resulting
from shifts to smaller sizes and single-serve packaging solutions in areas such as pet food and seafood.
Demand in the European aerosols metal can industry is principally influenced by consumer spending
patterns in the beauty and personal care and household products end use categories and has been stable in
Western Europe and growing in Eastern Europe since 2013, according to Smithers Pira. The other metal
can industry in Europe encompasses a broad range of end use categories, including the nutrition end use
category, where growth is driven by increasing emerging market demand as a result of rising levels of
disposable income and a greater awareness of health and wellness.

In North America, we are a significant participant in the food can, aluminum aerosol and aluminum
bottle businesses. The North American food can business, incorporating seafood and pet food cans, is a
large, mature market, characterized by relatively stable demand, as modest growth in two-piece cans and
pet food cans was offset by a decline in three-piece can demand in recent years. Two-piece cans are more
prevalent in the United States than in Europe, but tend to be heavier than those produced in Europe. Food
cans in North America also typically incorporate fewer convenience-enhancing and value-adding features,
such as easy-open ends, than typically found in Europe, creating a growth opportunity for our products and
innovations, including lighter-weight cans.

The North American aluminum aerosol market, serving end use categories in beauty and personal
care and household products has grown slightly since 2013, reflecting an increase in overall demand and a
movement from tinplate steel to aluminum aerosols. This material shift has been driven by ongoing
product premiumization and improved functionality for consumers, as well as by increased levels of
decoration and differentiation being sought by CPG companies to market their products.

In South America, where we produce aluminum aerosols in Brazil and Argentina, demand growth
reflects increased levels of disposable income and increased spending on beauty and personal care
products and a shift in material mix from steel aerosols to aluminum aerosols offering improved

113


-----

functionality to consumers in certain end use categories in the form of rust avoidance, and the potential for
increased differentiation and brand promotion.

In the aluminum premium beverage market, the convenience of the package to the consumer in the
form of a lightweight, robust, re-closable and recyclable offering is complemented by the opportunity for
brand owners to achieve high levels of decoration and differentiation. End use categories served by
aluminum premium beverage packaging include a broad range of beverages such as beer, wine, energy
drinks and ready-to-drink coffees.

**_Our Business_**

We are a leading supplier of innovative, value-added, infinitely-recyclable metal packaging solutions.

We have a well-diversified, blue-chip customer base consisting of over 1,300 accounts, comprised of
multi-national companies, large national and regional companies and small local businesses. In our target
regions of Europe, North America and South America, our customers include a wide variety of CPG
companies, which own some of the best known brands in the world. We are a long-standing partner to
global blue-chip customers, and approximately 60% of our sales are generated under multi-year contracts,
with the remainder largely subject to annual arrangements. A significant portion of our sales volumes are
supplied under contracts which include input cost pass-through provisions, which help us reduce margin
volatility due to changes in raw material costs. We believe we are one of the leading market players in each

114


-----

of the food, seafood, nutrition, beauty and personal care and paints and coatings end use categories, across
Europe, North America and South America. Specifically, in Europe, we believe that we have the
#1 position in nutrition and paint and coatings, as well as in the production of aerosol containers, typically
used in the beauty and personal care, household care and food end use categories. We also believe that we
have the #2 position in the food and seafood end use categories. In North America, we believe that we
have the #2 position in food (including seafood) and beauty and personal care. Further, we believe that we
have the #1 position in beauty and personal care in South America.

We operate 57 facilities across 21 countries in Europe (46 including one plant in each of Morocco,
South Korea and the Seychelles), North America (7) and South America (4) and employ approximately
7,800 personnel. Our plants in Europe provide a scalable and flexible pan-European manufacturing
footprint, and we have extensive component production in lower-cost labor regions. Our plants in North
America serve customers nationally, while our integrated slug facility in South America ensures
high-quality slug production.

Our end use categories served are characterized by stable-to-growing demand. Examples in food and
specialties include growth in single-serve offerings in end use categories such as food, seafood and pet
food, as well as increased penetration of lighter-weight two-piece can penetration and easy-open ends,
particularly in North America. Growth in demand in the nutrition end use category is driven by rising
disposable incomes in emerging markets. In addition, we see a continued favorable growth outlook for
aluminum aerosols, driven by growth in disposable incomes and migration from tinplate steel to aluminum
in South America, with a favorable growth outlook in North America principally attributable to material
migration from tinplate steel to aluminum. Premiumization by brand owners and a desire for increased
brand differentiation also represents a favorable driver across most of our businesses. In addition, we have
a well-invested asset base, with over $350 million invested in the past 5 years in new production facilities,
and a record of leading industry innovation which is backed by significant in-house research and
development expertise.

Organic growth initiatives have also involved expansionary strategic investments in new capacity of
over $350 million in new facilities since 2013. Notable investments in this period have included: (i) two new
can-making facilities in Roanoke, Virginia and Reno, Nevada, as well as a significant expansion of our
Conklin, New York, ends plant; positioning us to meet substantially all the metal packaging requirements
of a major U.S. CPG company pursuant to a long-term contract; (ii) the material enhancement of our
South American aerosol production capabilities and capacity to serve growing demand in that region,
including the completion of a new state-of-the-art aluminum slug production facility; and (iii) consistent
investment in our European business in pursuit of growth opportunities in selected end use categories,
including the infant formula/nutrition market, where demand growth is driven by emerging market
consumption, and in single-serve pet food formats, where convenience and a trend to premium products is
evident. These initiatives, as well as other acquisitions and investments over many years, in both existing
and adjacent end use categories, have increased our scale and diversification and provided opportunities to
grow our business with existing and new customers.

We are committed to market-leading innovation and product development and our global operations
are supported by a dedicated research and development center in France, where we employ 60 research
and engineering specialists. Our research and development capabilities allow us to deliver a competitive
advantage by providing (i) improved design, consumer convenience and innovation, (ii) cost-reduction, and
(iii) food safety compliant products.

**_Customers_**

We operate worldwide, selling metal packaging for a wide range of consumer products to national and
international customers. We supply leading manufacturers in each of the markets we serve, including Akzo
Nobel, Alicorp, Bayer, Beiersdorf, ConAgra Brands, COTY, Danone, Friesland Campina, Groupe d’Aucy,
Grupo Queruclor, JM Smucker, Johnson & Johnson, L’Or´eal, Mars, Reckitt Benckiser, Mondelez
International, Nestl´e, O Botic´ario, Thai Union, The Kraft Heinz Company and Unilever, among others.

Our top ten customers represented approximately 39% (top three 22%, four & five 6%, six through
ten 11%) of 2018 pro forma revenues, approximately 60% of which were backed by multi-year supply
agreements. These contracts generally provide for the pass-through of metal price fluctuations, and in
certain instances provide for pass-through of other input costs. In addition, within multiyear relationships,
both parties can work together to streamline the product, service and supply process, potentially leading to
cost reductions and improvements in product and service, with benefits arising to both parties. Wherever
possible, we seek to enter into multi-year supply agreements with our customers. In other cases, sales are
made under commercial supply agreements, typically of one-year’s duration, with prices based on expected
purchase volumes.

**_Competitors_**

Our principal competitors include Ball Corporation, Crown Holdings, Moravia and Silgan Holdings in
Europe. In North America our principal competitors include Ball Corporation, Ball Metalpack, CCL
Container, Crown Holdings and Silgan Holdings while in South America Impacta and TUBEX Group are
our principal competitors.

**_Energy, Raw Materials and Suppliers_**

The principal raw materials used in our operations are tinplate steel, aluminum and coatings and
lining compounds. Our major tinplate steel suppliers include ArcelorMittal, Baosteel, Dongbu Steel, HBIS
Group, Tata Steel, ThyssenKrupp Rasselstein and U.S. Steel. Our major aluminum suppliers include
Alcoa, Aluar, Ball Corporation, Copal, Constellium, Elval, Hydro, Novelis, Oddo and Talum.

116


-----

We continuously seek to minimize the price of raw materials and reduce exposure to price movements
in a number of ways, including the following:

   - harnessing the scale of our global metal purchasing requirements, to achieve better raw materials
pricing than smaller competitors;

  - entering into variable-priced pass-through contracts with customers, whereby selling prices are
indexed to the price of the underlying raw materials;

  - maintaining the focus on down-gauging;

  - continuing the process of reducing spoilage and waste in manufacturing;

   - rationalizing the number of both specifications and suppliers; and

  - in our European operations, hedging the price of aluminum ingot and the related euro/U.S. dollar
exposure.

We typically purchase tinplate steel under one-year contracts, with prices that are usually fixed in
advance. Agreements are generally renegotiated late in the year for effect from the beginning of the
following calendar year. Despite significant reductions in steel production capacity in Europe over the past
few years, we believe that adequate quantities of the relevant grades of packaging steel will continue to be
available from various producers and that we are not overly dependent upon any single supplier.

The imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in 2018 resulted in increased costs to both the
Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal operations. In common with our industry, we are in part reliant on
imported steel and aluminum to meet our requirements in North America, as domestic U.S. production of
the specifications and grades required is insufficient to meet industry requirements. These tariff-related
increases were passed on to our customers during the year. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
Business—Our profitability could be affected by the availability and cost of raw materials including as a
result of changes in tariffs and duties.’’

In our European operations, aluminum is generally purchased under three-year contracts, with prices
that are fixed in advance. In contrast, our Americas operations we typically purchase aluminum spot
market index rates. Despite an increase in the level of aluminum production being targeted to new end use
applications, including automotive and aerospace, we believe that adequate quantities of the relevant
grades of packaging aluminum will continue to be available from various producers and that we are not
overly dependent upon any single supplier.

**_Distribution_**

We use various freight and haulage contractors to make deliveries to customer sites or warehousing
facilities. In some cases, customers make their own delivery arrangements and therefore may purchase
from us on an ex-works basis. Warehousing facilities are primarily situated at our manufacturing facilities;
however, in some regions, we use networks of externally rented warehouses at strategic third-party
locations, close to major customers’ filling operations.

**_Intellectual Property and Innovation, Development and Engineering_**

We currently hold and maintain a significant number of patent families, each filed in several countries
and covering a range of different products in each jurisdiction.

Our global operations are supported by a dedicated team of 68 professionals engaged in continuous
innovation and development activities. These are primarily based at our facility in France, which provides
support across our global network of manufacturing facilities. Our focus is on serving the existing and
potential needs of customers, including the achievement of cost reductions, particularly metal content

117


-----

reduction, new product innovation, meeting new and anticipated legislative requirements, including those
related to food safety, as well as technology and support services.

Our French facility, for example, played a central role in developing, in conjunction with our suppliers,
new BPANIA coatings ahead of regulatory changes in some of our markets and a desire by our customers
to migrate to BPANIA coatings. Similarly, it is one of the few facilities that will be able to test pack chrome
6-free products, ahead of new chrome-free requirements to be met by Europe-produced tinplate steel by
September 2024.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Cash Requirements Related to Operations_**

Our principal sources of cash are cash generated from operations and external financings, including
borrowings and other credit facilities. Our principal funding arrangements include borrowings available
under the ABL Facility. For further details relating to the debt instruments described above, see
‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness.’’

The Group believes it has adequate liquidity to satisfy its cash needs for at least the next twelve
months. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2019, we had a pro forma operating profit of $247 million
and generated pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of $435 million.

We believe that our cash balances and future cash flow from operating activities, as well as our credit
facilities, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our purchases of property, plant and equipment, interest
payments on our notes and other credit facilities and dividend payments for at least the next twelve
months. In addition, we believe that we will be able to fund certain additional investments from our current
cash balances, credit facilities and cash flow from operating activities.

Accordingly, we believe that our long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to the servicing of its debt
obligations. We expect to satisfy our future long-term liquidity needs through a combination of cash flow
generated from operations and, where appropriate, to refinance our debt obligations in advance of their
respective maturity dates.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Capital expenditure for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $21 million to $146 million,
compared to $125 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable
to spending on short payback projects across the Group during the period. In the Ardagh Carve-out
Business, capital expenditure was mainly attributable to short payback project spending and to increased
capital investment initiatives. In the Exal business, capital expenditure was mainly attributable to new
manufacturing lines in South America and manufacturing line upgrades in North America.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2018, we would have had approximately 7,800 employees. Approximately 6,800 of
these employees were employed by the Ardagh Carve-out Business, while approximately 1,000 of these
employees were employed by Exal.

**Environmental, Health and Safety and Product Safety Regulation**

Our operations and properties are regulated under a wide range of laws, ordinances, regulations and
other legal requirements concerning the environment, health and safety and product safety in each
jurisdiction in which we operate. We believe that our manufacturing facilities comply, in all material
respects, with these laws and regulations.

118


-----

The principal environmental issues facing us include the impact on air quality through gas and particle
emissions, including the emission of greenhouse gases, the environmental impact of the disposal of water
used in our production processes, the generation and disposal of waste, the receiving, use and storage of
hazardous and non-hazardous materials and the potential contamination and subsequent remediation of
land, surface water and groundwater arising from our operations.

Our substantial operations in the E.U. are subject to, among additional requirements, the
requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive (the ‘‘IED’’), which requires that operators of industrial
installations, take into account the whole environmental performance of the installation and obtain and
maintain compliance with a permit, which sets emission limit values that are based on best available
techniques.

Our E.U. production facilities are also regulated under the E.U. ETS, now in its third phase which
runs until 2020. Under this regime, the European Commission sets emission caps for greenhouse gases for
all installations covered by the scheme, which are then implemented by Member States. Installations that
emit less than their greenhouse gas emission cap can sell emission allowances on the open market and
installations that exceed their emission cap are required to buy emission allowances and are penalized if
they are unable to surrender the required amount of allowances at the end of each trading year. In
addition, the EPA has also begun to regulate certain greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Furthermore, the E.U. Directive on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and
remedying of environmental damage aims to make those who cause damage to the environment
(specifically damage to habitats and species protected by E.U. law, damage to water resources and land
contamination which presents a threat to human health) financially responsible for its remediation. It
requires operators of industrial premises (including those which hold a permit governed by the IED) to
take preventive measures to avoid environmental damage, inform the regulators when such damage has or
may occur and to remediate contamination.

Our operations are also subject to stringent and complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the
environment, health and safety and product safety including, but not limited to: the U.S. federal Clean Air
Act, the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, the U.S. federal Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980
(‘‘CERCLA’’). These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require obtaining permits to
conduct industrial operations; (ii) restrict the types and quantities and concentration of various substances
that can be released into the environment; (iii) result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits,
licenses and authorizations; (iv) require that additional pollution controls be installed; and (v) require
remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, including related natural
resource damages. Specifically, certain U.S. environmental laws, such as CERCLA or Superfund, as well as
analogous state laws, provide for strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for the
investigation and remediation of releases or the disposal of regulated materials into the environment
including soil and groundwater, as well as for damages to natural resources.

Moreover, restrictions on BPA in coatings for some of our products, which have been proposed or
adopted in the E.U. under the REACH legislation and in some of its Member States, have required us to
develop substitute materials for our production.

We are also committed to ensuring that safe operating practices are established, implemented and
maintained throughout our organization. In addition, we have instituted active health and safety programs
throughout our company. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We are subject to various
environmental and other legal requirements and may be subject to new requirements of this kind in the
future that could impose substantial costs upon us.’’

**Legal Proceedings**

In 2015, the German competition authority (the Federal Cartel Office) initiated an investigation of
the practices in Germany of metal packaging manufacturers in the market for paints, coatings and food
metal packagers, including the Ardagh Group. In 2018, the European Commission took over this
investigation and the German investigation is ended as a result. The European Commission’s investigation
is ongoing, and there is at this stage no certainty as to the extent of any charge which may arise.
Accordingly, no provision has been recognized. In the Transaction Agreement, the Ardagh Group has
agreed to indemnify us for certain losses in connection with this investigation.

With the exception of the above legal matter, we are involved in certain other legal proceedings
arising in the normal course of its business. We believe that none of these proceedings, either individually
or in aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations or cash flows.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following is a summary of the material terms of our principal financing arrangements, which may not_
_be in place on the Issue Date. The following summaries do not purport to describe all of the applicable terms_
_and conditions of such arrangements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual agreements,_
_which may not be in place on the Issue Date. We recommend that you refer to the actual agreements for further_
_details to the extent that they are in place as of the date of this Offering Memorandum._

**ABL Facility**

**_Overview_**

We anticipate that Trivium Packaging B.V. and certain of its subsidiaries (such subsidiaries, the
‘‘Borrowers’’) will enter into (i) an up to $240 million senior secured asset-based multicurrency revolving
credit facility (the ‘‘General Facility’’) available to the Borrowers (other than Borrowers organized under
the laws of France (the ‘‘French Borrowers’’)) and (ii) a $10 million senior secured asset-based revolving
credit facility available to the French Borrowers (the ‘‘French Facility,’’ and together with the General
Facility, the ‘‘ABL Facility’’). We anticipate that the ABL Facility will be provided by a syndicate of
financial institutions (collectively, the ‘‘ABL Lenders’’), with Citibank, N.A. (or an affiliate thereof) as
administrative agent for the purpose of, among other things, paying costs, fees and expenses related to the
Combination, financing ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes of the Borrowers and the
other subsidiaries of Trivium Packaging B.V. Under the General Facility, the Borrowers may request to
increase the commitments thereunder by up to $60 million (or in the case of the French Facility,
$20 million) subject to certain conditions. We anticipate that the ABL Facility will be guaranteed by
Trivium Packaging B.V., and certain of the Borrowers (with respect to the obligations of certain other
Borrowers), and, no later than 90 days following the Completion Date, certain other subsidiaries of
Trivium Packaging B.V. after giving effect to the Combination (and no person shall guarantee the Notes
unless such person also guarantees the ABL Facility) (the ‘‘ABL Post-Completion Date Guarantors’’ and,
together with Trivium Packaging B.V. and the Borrowers, the ‘‘ABL Loan Parties’’). We anticipate that the
ABL Facility will be secured by assets of the ABL Loan Parties, with a first priority lien on the ABL
Collateral (as defined below) and a junior lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral, subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and subject to certain exclusions. We anticipate that the collateral securing the
ABL Facility will also secure liabilities under bank products (including credit card transactions and cash
management services) and hedging obligations owed to the ABL Lenders or their affiliates.

**_Final Maturity and Amortization_**

We anticipate that the ABL Facility will mature on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the closing
and (ii) at any time, the date that is 91 calendar days prior to the earliest scheduled maturity date under
documents in respect of indebtedness of Trivium Packaging B.V. or any restricted subsidiary with an
aggregate outstanding principal amount (including undrawn commitments in respect thereof) in excess of a
specified amount, in each case in effect at such time, unless the indebtedness under such other documents
has been repaid in full or refinanced to have a scheduled maturity date that is at least 91 calendar days
after the date in clause (i) above subject to certain exceptions that will be set forth in the ABL Facility.

**_Borrowings_**

We anticipate that borrowings under the ABL Facility will be made available in U.S. dollars, British
pound and euro. We anticipate that a portion of the ABL Facility will be available for issuing letters of
credit and for making swingline loans. We anticipate that the borrowings under the ABL Facility may be
prepaid without premium or penalty. We anticipate that the ABL Facility will contain customary
mandatory prepayment requirements if the outstandings thereunder exceed the availability.

126


-----

We anticipate that borrowings by each Borrower will be limited by the borrowing base applicable to
such Borrower as set forth in the ABL Facility.

**_Covenants_**

We anticipate that the ABL Facility will be subject to a springing financial covenant that will require
Trivium Packaging B.V. to maintain a 1.0 to 1.0 fixed charge coverage ratio, tested quarterly, if global
borrowing availability is less than 10% of the lesser of (i) the commitments as of such date and (ii) the
global borrowing base as of such date. We anticipate that such financial covenant will be subject to
customary equity cure provisions. We anticipate that, if such availability level is subsequently exceeded for
a period of thirty consecutive calendar days, the testing of such financial covenant would be suspended.

The ABL Facility will also include representations, warranties and covenants that are generally of a
nature customary for a facility of this type offered to similar borrowers.

**_Events of Default_**

We anticipate that the ABL Facility will contain provisions governing certain events of default
customary for a facility of this type offered to similar borrowers. The occurrence of an event of default
could result in the acceleration of payment obligations under the ABL Facility.

There are no guarantees that Trivium Packaging B.V. and the Borrowers will be able to enter into the
ABL Facility or that the terms reflected in this description will be reflected in the final ABL
documentation.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

Unless the context otherwise requires, terms defined below in this description of the Intercreditor
Agreement apply only to this section.

Obligations (other than (A) any action permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (it being understood
that open market purchases or voluntary prepayments or tender or exchange offers by any member of the

constitute the exercise of a right to require any member of the Group to acquire any Obligation), (B) any

the relevant creditors where that amendment or waiver does not constitute a Default under any Secured
Document or any Unsecured Document which is not the subject of that amendment or waiver or (C) any

Intercreditor Agreement); or (e) the petitioning, applying or voting for, or the taking of any formal steps

any analogous procedure in any jurisdiction; provided that the following shall not constitute Enforcement
Action: (i) the taking of any action falling within (a)(ii), (iii), (iv) and (vii) or (e) above which is necessary
(but only to the extent necessary) to preserve the validity, existence or priority of claims in respect of
Obligations, including the registration of such claims before any court or governmental authority and the

and/or among any Secured Creditors and Unsecured Creditors, to the extent the terms of such agreement
address (i) matters relating to the payment priority as between such parties (or their representatives),
(ii) the ability to exercise any rights granted under the Intercreditor Agreement to such creditors,
(iii) other matters customary for intercreditor agreements of such type and (iv) any other matters related
thereto; provided, that such agreement shall not conflict with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Debtors may make payments in respect of the
Secured Obligations at any time in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Secured Documents.

receive the benefit of, and no Debtor shall grant or permit to exist, (a) any lien from any member of the
Group in respect of that class of Secured Obligations, in addition to the Fixed Asset Collateral and the
ABL Collateral, provided that, to the extent legally possible and subject to the guarantee and security
principles contained in the applicable Debt Document (the ‘‘Agreed Security Principles’’), at the same time
such lien is also offered either (i) to the applicable Security Agent as trustee or agent for its benefit and the
benefit of all other classes of Secured Creditors; or (ii) in the case of any jurisdiction in which an effective
lien cannot be granted in favor of such Security Agent(s) as trustee or agent for such Secured Creditors:
(A) to such Secured Creditors in respect of their Obligations or (B) to the applicable Security Agent(s)
under a parallel debt structure for their benefit and the benefit of such Secured Creditors, and in each

indemnity or assurance that is given to all the Secured Creditors in respect of the Secured Obligations

Agreed Security Principles, at the same time such guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is
also offered to all other classes of Secured Creditors in respect of their Secured Obligations and ranks in
the same order of priority as described in the section ‘‘—Ranking and priority;’’ provided, further, that this
paragraph will not be violated with respect to any lien securing any Secured Obligations, or any such
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss, if the applicable Security Agent(s) in respect of all
other classes of Secured Obligations are given a reasonable opportunity to accept a lien on such asset or
such guarantee, indemnity or assurance, and such Security Agent(s) expressly declines to accept a lien on
such asset or such guarantee, indemnity or assurance in respect of one or more classes of Secured

under clause (c) of the definition thereof or (to the extent such action is directly related to the enforcement
of Collateral) under clause (e) of the definition thereof other than as permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement. However, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to a Debtor, each Secured
Creditor may, to the extent it is able to do so under the relevant documents governing the Secured
Obligations, take Enforcement Action under clause (e) of the definition thereof or claim in the winding up,
dissolution, administration, reorganization or similar insolvency event of that Debtor for Secured
Obligations owing to it (but, for the avoidance of doubt, may not direct any Security Agent to enforce the
Collateral granted in common in respect of the Secured Obligations in any manner not permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement).

_Unsecured Creditors: Permitted Payments_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Debtors may make payments in respect of the
Unsecured Obligations at any time in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Unsecured
Documents. To the extent that any Unsecured Document includes provisions subordinating the related
Unsecured Obligations to any other Obligations of the Debtors, the provisions regarding rights of
payment, enforcement and subordination, together with any related restrictions on amendments of those
provisions, will be incorporated into the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Unsecured Creditors: Guarantees_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Unsecured Creditors may only take, accept or
receive the benefit of any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any member of the
Group in respect of the Unsecured Obligations in addition to (a) those in the Intercreditor Agreement;
and (b) any such guarantee, indemnity or assurance that is given to all the Secured Creditors in respect of
the Obligations owed to them by any member of the Group, provided that, in each case, to the extent
legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, at the same time such guarantee, indemnity
or other assurance against loss is also offered to the other Primary Creditors in respect of their Obligations
with the rank in the same relative order of priority.

The Intercreditor Agreement will not purport to restrict any Unsecured Creditor taking, accepting or
receiving the benefit of any lien, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss from any person
which is not a member of the Group in respect of the Unsecured Obligations.

_Intra-Group Obligations: Restrictions on Payment and Dealings_

Prior to the last Discharge Date to occur in respect of any of the Primary Obligations (the ‘‘Final
Discharge Date’’), the Debtors shall not, and shall procure that no other member of the Group will, make
any payments of the Intra-Group Obligations at any time unless that payment is otherwise permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Debtors and members of the Group may make payments in respect of the
Intra-Group Obligations (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) from time to time, except that
payments may not be made if, at the time of such payment, an acceleration event with respect to any of the
Secured Obligations or Unsecured Obligations has occurred and is continuing, unless: (i) to the extent
such payment would result in a breach of any Debt Document, the relevant Representatives, as applicable,
have consented to such payment; (ii) that payment is made solely to facilitate the payment of the Primary
Obligations or (iii) any director or officer of any Debtor is required by mandatory law to make or demand
payment of the relevant Intra-Group Obligations in order to avoid personal or criminal liability.

136


-----

_Subordinated Obligations: Restrictions on Payment and Dealings_

Prior to the Final Discharge Date, the Debtors shall not, and the Company shall procure that no other
member of the Group will, make, and no Subordinated Creditor will accept, any payments of the
Subordinated Obligations at any time unless that payment is otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor
Agreement. Members of the Group may make payments in respect of the Subordinated Obligations if that
payment is, prior to the Final Discharge Date, either (a) permitted by the outstanding Debt Documents or
(b) consented to by the relevant Representatives under any Debt Documents pursuant to which such
payment would result in a breach.

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

_General_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, until the last Discharge Date to occur in respect of any
of the Secured Obligations (the ‘‘Secured Debt Discharge Date’’) in the event that any member of the
Group becomes subject to an insolvency event, including under Title 11 of the United States Code entitled
‘‘Bankruptcy,’’ as now or hereafter in effect, or any successor statute (the ‘‘U.S. Bankruptcy Code’’), the
Representatives and each other Primary Creditor agree not to take any action under the applicable
insolvency or liquidation proceeding that would be inconsistent with its agreements in the Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the ABL Agent and, before the last Discharge Date in respect of the
First Lien Obligations (the ‘‘First Lien Discharge Date’’), the Majority First Lien Creditors (as defined
below) and, thereafter, the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as defined below). See ‘‘—Enforcement of
Security—Manner of Enforcement—Fixed Asset Collateral’’. If any member of the Group commences an
insolvency or liquidation proceeding, then the Intercreditor Agreement, which the parties expressly
acknowledge is a ‘‘subordination agreement’’ under section 510(a) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, will be
effective during such insolvency or liquidation proceeding of any such Debtor and the relative rights as to
the Fixed Asset Collateral, the ABL Collateral and proceeds thereof and shall continue after any Debtor
commences such insolvency or liquidation proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of the petition.

_Payment of Distributions_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions in respect of Intra-Group
Obligations owed by a member of the Group that is not a Debtor, after the occurrence of an insolvency
event in relation to any member of the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets
of such member of the Group (in the case of holders of Secured Notes and Senior Notes or any Primary
Creditor whose Obligations are in the form of notes or other debt securities outstanding, only to the extent
that such amount constitutes enforcement proceeds of Collateral) in respect of Obligations owed to that
party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of
such member of the Group to pay that distribution to the applicable Security Agent until the Secured Debt
Discharge Date. The Security Agents shall apply distributions paid to them in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’).

_Set-off_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions in respect of Intra-Group
Obligations owed by a member of the Group that is not a Debtor, to the extent that any member of the
Group’s Obligations are discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in relation to that member of the Group (in the case of a set-off (mandatory or otherwise)
received by holders of Secured Notes and Senior Notes or any Primary Creditor whose Obligations are in
the form of notes or other debt securities outstanding, only to the extent that such amount constitutes
enforcement proceeds of Collateral), any creditor that benefited from that set-off shall, to the extent
legally permissible, pay an amount equal to the amount of the Obligations owed to it which are discharged
by that set-off to the applicable Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’). The set-off provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement do not apply to certain netting by a Hedge Counterparty or any set-off which gives effect to a
payment permitted to Intra-Group Lenders.

137


-----

_Non-cash Distributions_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, if either Security Agent or any other Primary Creditor
receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the Obligations, the Obligations will
not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually
applied towards the Obligations.

_Filing of Claims_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation
to any member of the Group, each Secured Creditor (including holders of Secured Notes) irrevocably
authorizes the Fixed Asset Security Agent, on its behalf, to: (a) take any Enforcement Action (in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Debt Documents of such
creditor) against such Group member in respect of the Fixed Asset Obligations; (b) demand, sue, prove
and give receipt for any or all of such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations; (c) collect and receive all
distributions on, or on account of, any or all of such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations; and (d) file
claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Fixed Asset Security Agent considers reasonably
necessary to recover such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation
to any member of the Group, each Secured Creditor (including holders of Secured Notes) irrevocably
authorizes the ABL Security Agent, on its behalf, to: (a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Debt Documents of such creditor) against such
Group member in respect of the ABL Obligations; (b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of
such Group member’s ABL Obligations; (c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any
or all of such Group member’s ABL Obligations; and (d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other
things the ABL Security Agent considers reasonably necessary to recover such Group member’s ABL
Obligations.

_Further Assurance; Insolvency Event_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that each Secured Creditor (including holders of Secured
Notes) will (a) do all things that each of the Security Agents reasonably requests in order to give effect to
the provisions described in this ‘‘—Effect of insolvency event’’ section and (b) if the Security Agents are
not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by the ‘‘—Effect of insolvency event’’ provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement or if the applicable Security Agent reasonably requests that a Secured Creditor
take that action, undertake such action in accordance with the instructions of such Security Agent or grant
a power of attorney to such Security Agent (on such terms as such Security Agent may reasonably require)
to enable such Security Agent to take such action; _provided that nothing in paragraph will permit any_
Security Agent to request any action which would contravene any other provision of the Intercreditor
Agreement or to allow a Security Agent to exercise, or cause any Secured Creditor to exercise, any
Enforcement Action in respect of any Collateral to the extent that Security Agent was not permitted to
undertake such Enforcement Action under another provision of the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Financing Matters_

Until the Discharge Date in respect of the ABL Obligations (the ‘‘ABL Discharge Date’’), if any
Debtor becomes subject to an insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the ABL Security Agent shall
desire to permit the use of ‘‘cash collateral’’ (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code) constituting ABL Collateral on which the ABL Security Agent or any other creditor has a lien or to
permit any Debtor to obtain financing, whether from any ABL Creditor or any other person under
Section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law
(‘‘DIP Financing’’) that is secured at least in part by the ABL Collateral, then, the Fixed Asset Security

138


-----

Agent, on behalf of itself and the Fixed Asset Creditors, agrees that it will raise no objection to such use of
cash collateral or DIP Financing provided such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing meets the following
requirement: the terms of the use of cash collateral or DIP Financing (A) do not compel the applicable
Debtor to seek confirmation of a specific plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan for
which all or substantially all of the material terms are set forth in the order authorizing such use of cash
collateral, DIP Financing documentation or a related document, (B) do not expressly require the
liquidation of the Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing documentation or the order
authorizing the use of cash collateral, and (C) do not require that any lien of the Fixed Asset Security
Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral be subordinated to or rank pari passu with any lien on the Fixed Asset
Collateral securing such DIP Financing. To the extent the liens securing the ABL Obligations are
subordinated to or pari passu with the liens securing such DIP Financing which meets the requirement in
the immediately preceding sentence, the Fixed Asset Security Agent will subordinate its liens on the ABL
Collateral to the liens thereon securing such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and will
not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by
the ABL Security Agent or to the extent permitted in the manner set forth below). If, in connection with
any cash collateral use or DIP Financing, any liens on the ABL Collateral held by the ABL Creditors are
subject to a surcharge or are subordinated to an administrative priority claim, a professional fee
‘‘carve-out,’’ or fees owed to the United States Trustee, then the liens on the ABL Collateral of the Fixed
Asset Creditors shall also be subordinated to such interest or claim and shall remain subordinated to the
liens on the ABL Collateral of the ABL Creditors consistent with the other terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The ABL Security Agent and the holders of ABL Obligations will agree to similar limitations with
respect to their right to object to any use of cash collateral constituting Fixed Asset Collateral or to any
DIP Financing to be secured at least in part by the Fixed Asset Collateral that has been consented to by
the Fixed Asset Security Agent (acting on behalf of the Majority First Lien Creditors prior to the First
Lien Discharge Date, and, thereafter, the Majority Second Lien Creditors) that meets comparable
requirements as set forth above in this paragraph.

In an insolvency or liquidation proceeding in the U.S., the provision of any DIP Financing that is
secured by liens on Fixed Asset Collateral senior to or pari passu with the liens securing the First Lien
Obligations or any consent to the use of cash collateral constituting Fixed Asset Collateral under
section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code shall require only the consent of, prior to the First Lien
Discharge Date, the Majority First Lien Creditors.

_Automatic Stay_

Until the ABL Discharge Date, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, on behalf of itself and the Fixed Asset
Creditors, agrees that none of them shall seek (or support any other person seeking) relief from the
automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the ABL
Collateral, without the prior written consent of the ABL Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent and the
ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to seek relief from the automatic
stay in respect of any Fixed Asset Collateral.

_Sales_

Subject to certain other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Fixed Asset Security Agent
will consent and will not object or oppose, or support any party in objecting to or opposing, a motion to
dispose of any ABL Collateral free and clear of any liens or other claims under Section 363 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), or any related motion
to establish bidding procedures for such a sale or disposition, if (i) the ABL Security Agent and the
requisite ABL Creditors shall have consented to such sale or disposition of such ABL Collateral, (ii) such
motion does not impair, subject to the priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the rights of the

139


-----

Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors under Section 363(k) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any applicable bankruptcy law) (provided that the right of
any Fixed Asset Creditor to offset its claim against the purchase price for any ABL Collateral exists only
after the ABL Discharge Date), and (iii) the terms of any proposed order approving such transaction
provide for the liens of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors on the ABL
Collateral to attach to the proceeds of the ABL Collateral that is the subject of such disposition, subject to
the lien priorities and the other terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Security
Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to object to a
sale or other disposition of any Fixed Asset Collateral (or any portion thereof).

_Adequate Protection_

None of the Fixed Asset Security Agent nor the other Fixed Asset Creditors shall contest (or support
any other person contesting) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (1) any request by the ABL
Security Agent or the other ABL Creditors for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Collateral,
provided (A) until last Discharge Date to occur in respect of any of the Fixed Asset Obligations (the
‘‘Fixed Asset Discharge Date’’) such request for adequate protection shall not seek the creation of any lien
over additional assets or property of any Debtor other than with respect to assets or property that
constitute ABL Collateral and (B) if such additional assets or property shall also constitute Fixed Asset
Collateral, (i) a lien shall have been created in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent in respect of such
Collateral and (ii) the lien thereon in favor of the ABL Creditors shall be subordinated to the extent set
forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, or (2) any objection by the ABL Security Agent or other ABL
Creditor to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the ABL Security Agent or other ABL
Creditors claiming a lack of adequate protection; _provided that if the ABL Security Agent is granted_
adequate protection in the form of a lien on additional or replacement collateral, the Fixed Asset Security
Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors may seek or request adequate protection in the form of lien on
such additional or replacement collateral; it being understood and agreed that (1) if such additional or
replacement collateral shall also constitute Fixed Asset Collateral, the lien on such additional or
replacement collateral in favor of the ABL Security Agent shall be subordinate to all liens on such
additional or replacement collateral in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and (2) if such additional or
replacement collateral shall also constitute ABL Collateral, the lien on such additional or replacement
collateral in favor of the ABL Security Agent shall be senior to all liens on such additional or replacement
collateral in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent and the other ABL
Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to contest any request of the Fixed
Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors for adequate protection or any objection of the
Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors to any motion, relief, action or proceeding
for lack of adequate protection.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement or in connection with the
exercise of remedies with respect to (i) the ABL Collateral, nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall
limit the rights of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors from seeking
adequate protection with respect to their rights in the Fixed Asset Collateral in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment, periodic cash
payments or otherwise, other than from proceeds of the ABL Collateral) or (ii) the Fixed Asset Collateral,
nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall limit the rights of the ABL Security Agent or the other ABL
Creditors from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the ABL Collateral in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment,
periodic cash payments or otherwise, other than from proceeds of the Fixed Asset Collateral).

140


-----

_Post-petition Interest_

No Fixed Asset Security Agent nor any other Fixed Asset Creditor shall oppose or seek to challenge
any claim by the ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor for allowance in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding of ABL Obligations consisting of interest, fees, expenses and other charges that,
pursuant to the ABL Documents, continue to accrue after the commencement of any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees, expenses and other charges are allowed or
allowable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any other applicable bankruptcy law) or in any such
insolvency or liquidation proceeding, to the extent of the value of the lien securing any ABL Creditor’s
claim, without regard to the existence of the lien of the Fixed Asset Security Agent on behalf of the Fixed
Asset Creditors on the Collateral. The ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to
similar limitations with respect to their right to oppose or seek to challenge any comparable claim by the
Fixed Asset Security Agent or any other Fixed Asset Creditor for post-petition interest, fees, expenses and
other charges to the extent of the value of the lien securing any such Fixed Asset Creditor’s claim.

_Certain Waivers_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf
of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, (i) waives any claim and objection it may have against any ABL
Creditor arising out of the election of any ABL Creditor of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law) or out of any grant
of a security interest in connection with the ABL Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
(provided that any such grant of a security interest comports with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, including the provisions governing grant of security interests described under the headings
‘‘—Financing Matters’’ and ‘‘—Adequate Protection’’ above); (ii) agrees that it will not assert or enforce
any claim under Section 506(c) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other
applicable bankruptcy law) senior to or on parity with the Liens on the ABL Collateral securing the ABL
Obligations; and (iii) agrees that it will not assert or enforce any claim against any ABL Creditor under the
‘‘equities of the case’’ exception of Section 552(b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of
any other applicable bankruptcy law). The ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree to waive
similar claims and objections with respect to the actions of any of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and any
other Fixed Asset Creditors with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral.

_Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classification_

The Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, and the
ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other ABL Creditors, will acknowledge and agree that
the grants of liens pursuant to the ABL Security Documents, the Fixed Asset Security Documents in
respect of the First Lien Obligations and any future Fixed Asset Security Documents in respect of the
Second Lien Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of liens, and because of, among other
things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Obligations and
the ABL Obligations are fundamentally different and must be separately classified in any plan of
reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed, or adopted in an insolvency
or liquidation proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on
behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, and the ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other
ABL Creditors, each agrees that the First Lien Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the ABL
Creditors will vote as separate classes in connection with any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive
restructuring plan in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and that no Security Agent nor any Creditor
will seek to vote with a Creditor of another class as a single class in connection with any plan of
reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To
further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in this paragraph, if it is held that the claims of the
First Lien Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the ABL Creditors in respect of the Collateral

141


-----

constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of secured claims subject to the relative lien
priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), then the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on
behalf of the Fixed Asset Creditors and the ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL
Creditors, will acknowledge and agree that, subject to certain other provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, all distributions from the ABL Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of
senior and junior secured claims against the Debtors in respect of the ABL Collateral (with the effect
being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the ABL Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose
ignoring all claims held by the Fixed Asset Creditors), the ABL Creditors shall be entitled to receive, in
addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all
amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, expenses and other charges, including any
additional interest payable pursuant to the ABL Documents, arising from or related to a default, whether
or not a claim therefor is allowed as a claim in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any
distribution from the ABL Collateral is made in respect of the claims held by the Fixed Asset Creditors,
with each Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Fixed Asset Creditors,
acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL
Creditors, amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the ABL Collateral to the extent
necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the
claim or recovery of the Fixed Asset Creditors). The ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree
to similar turnover provisions with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral.

The Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors, on the one hand, and the ABL
Security Agent and the ABL Creditors, on the other hand, shall retain the right to vote and otherwise act
in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including the right to vote to accept or reject any plan of
reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan) to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Turnover of Receipts_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, if at any time prior to the
Final Discharge Date, any Creditor receives or recovers (a) any payment or distribution of, or on account
of or in relation to, any of the Obligations which is not either (i) a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) made in accordance with the applicable proceeds waterfall (as described in
the section ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’); (b) other than where set-off applies (in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement), any amount by way of set-off in respect of any of the Obligations owed to it
which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement; (c) notwithstanding
clauses (a) and (b) above, and other than where set-off applies, any amount: (i) on account of, or in
relation to, any of the Obligations: (A) during the continuation of a Distress Event or (B) as a result of any
other litigation or proceedings against a member of the Group (other than during the continuation of an
insolvency event in respect of such member of the Group); or (ii) by way of set-off in respect of any of the
Obligations owed to it during the continuation of a Distress Event; (d) the proceeds of any enforcement of
any Fixed Asset Collateral or ABL Collateral or the proceeds of any Distressed Disposal, in each case,
except in accordance with the applicable proceeds waterfall (as described in the section ‘‘—Application of
Proceeds’’); or (e) other than where set-off applies, any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on
account of or in relation to, any of the Obligations owed by any member of the Group which is not in
accordance with the applicable proceeds waterfall (as described in the section ‘‘—Application of
Proceeds’’) and which is made as a result of, or after the occurrence of, an insolvency event in respect of
such member of the Group (provided that, in the case of receipt or recovery by holders of Secured Notes
and Senior Notes or any Primary Creditor whose Obligations are in the form of notes or other debt
securities outstanding, clauses (c), (d) and (e) shall only apply to the extent that such distribution
constitutes enforcement proceeds from Collateral), that Creditor will (i) in relation to receipts and
recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (A) hold an amount of that receipt or recovery equal
to the relevant Obligations (or if less, the amount received or recovered) on trust for (x) the ABL Security

Agent (in the case of ABL Obligations, ABL Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of the foregoing)
and promptly pay that amount to the ABL Security Agent for application in accordance with the
application of proceeds waterfall described in the section ‘‘—Application of proceeds—ABL Collateral,’’
or (y) the Fixed Asset Security Agent (in the case of Fixed Asset Obligations, Fixed Asset Collateral, or
amounts attributable to any of the foregoing) and promptly pay that amount to the Fixed Asset Security
Agent for application in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall described in the section
‘‘—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral,’’ and (B) promptly pay an amount equal to the
amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant Obligations to (x) the ABL Security
Agent (in the case of ABL Obligations, ABL Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of the foregoing)
and promptly pay that amount to the ABL Security Agent for application in accordance with the
application of proceeds waterfall described in the section ‘‘—Application of proceeds—ABL Collateral,’’
or (y) the Fixed Asset Security Agent (in the case of Fixed Asset Obligations, Fixed Asset Collateral, or
amounts attributable to any of the foregoing) and promptly pay that amount to the Fixed Asset Security
Agent for application in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall described in the section
‘‘—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral,’’ and (ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries
received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an amount equal to that recovery or receipt to (x) the
ABL Security Agent (in the case of ABL Obligations, ABL Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of
the foregoing) and promptly pay that amount to the ABL Security Agent for application in accordance
with the application of proceeds waterfall described in the section ‘‘—Application of proceeds—ABL
Collateral,’’ or (y) the Fixed Asset Security Agent (in the case of Fixed Asset Obligations, Fixed Asset
Collateral, or amounts attributable to any of the foregoing) and promptly pay that amount to the Fixed
Asset Security Agent for application in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall described in
the section ‘‘—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral.’’

The Intercreditor Agreement will also include certain customary loss sharing provisions.

**_Deferral of Subrogation_**

Under the Intercreditor Agreement:

(a) Subject to (c) below, if the Secured Obligations of any Creditor are wholly or partly paid out of
any proceeds received in respect of or on account of any Secured Obligations owing to one or
more other Creditors, that other Creditor will, to that extent, be subrogated to the Secured
Obligations so paid (and all securities and guarantees for those Secured Obligations).

(b) Subject to clause (c) below, to the extent that any Creditor (each a ‘‘Subrogated Creditor’’) is
entitled to exercise rights of subrogation under clause (a) above, each other Creditor (subject in
each case to it being indemnified, secured or prefunded to its satisfaction against any resulting
costs, expenses and liabilities) will give such assistance to enable such rights to be so exercised as
such Subrogated Creditor may reasonably request.

(c) No Creditor or Debtor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of the performance by
it of its obligations under the Debt Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and
whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights under the Debt Documents of any
Creditor which ranks ahead of it in accordance with the priorities as described in the section
‘‘—Ranking and priority’’ until such time as all of the Obligations owing to each prior ranking
Creditor (or, in the case of any Debtor prior to the Final Discharge Date) have been irrevocably
paid in full or, as it relates to the ABL Obligations, the ABL Discharge Date has occurred.

(d) Subject to certain exceptions, no Subordinated Creditor will exercise any rights which it may have
to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any
rights under the Debt Documents of any Creditor until the Final Discharge Date.

143

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Manner of Enforcement—Fixed Asset Collateral_

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date the Fixed Asset Security Agent will (subject as further set
out below and other than in certain limited circumstances specified in the Intercreditor Agreement where
the Fixed Asset Security Agent will act on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) act on
the instructions of (i) the Majority Super Senior Creditors and (ii) to the extent the relevant matter is
prohibited under the Debt Documents related to the First Lien Obligations, the Majority First Lien
Creditors, in each case subject to the consultation period referred to below and provided that such
instructions are consistent with the security enforcement principles set forth below. Following the Super
Senior Discharge Date but prior to the First Lien Discharge Date, the Fixed Asset Security Agent will act
on the instructions of the Majority First Lien Creditors (other than in certain limited circumstances
specified in the Intercreditor Agreement where the Fixed Asset Security Agent will act on the instructions
of the Majority Second Lien Creditors). Following the First Lien Discharge Date but prior to the last
Discharge Date in respect of the Second Lien Obligations (the ‘‘Second Lien Discharge Date’’), the Fixed
Asset Security Agent will act on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors. Following the
Fixed Asset Discharge Date in the event the ABL Discharge Date has not occurred, the Fixed Asset
Security Agent will act on the instructions of the ABL Agent or the ABL Security Agent. In each of the
scenarios outlined in this paragraph, the relevant parties giving instructions to the Fixed Asset Security
Agent shall be the ‘‘Instructing Group.’’

_Consultation_

Prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date and prior to giving any instructions to the Fixed Asset
Security Agent to commence enforcement of all or part of the Fixed Asset Collateral and/or the requesting
of a distressed disposal and/or the release or disposal of claims or Fixed Asset Collateral on a distressed
disposal, and the taking of any other actions consequential on (or necessary to effect) the enforcement of
the Fixed Asset Collateral (‘‘Enforcement’’), the Representative of the largest aggregate principal amount
of the First Lien Obligations (or, to the extent that the Second Lien Creditors are permitted to do so, the
Representative of the largest aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Obligations) or the agent
under any Super Senior RCF Debt (or if there is no Super Senior RCF Debt, the Super Senior Hedge
Counterparty with the largest exposure), as the case may be, shall notify the Fixed Asset Security Agent,
the ABL Agent and each other Representatives of the Fixed Asset Obligations that the applicable Fixed
Asset Collateral has become enforceable. As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of such a notice
instructing the Fixed Asset Security Agent to solicit instructions to enforce Fixed Asset Collateral or take
other Enforcement Action given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority First Lien
Creditors and/or Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable), the Fixed Asset Security Agent, shall
distribute such notice to the relevant addressees promptly upon receipt, following which, the Super Senior
RCF Debt (or if there is no Super Senior RCF Debt, the Super Senior Hedge Counterparty with the
largest exposure) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors), the First Lien Notes
Trustee and the Representative(s) of any other First Lien Debt will consult in good faith with each other
and the Fixed Asset Security Agent for a period of 15 days from the date such notice is received by such
persons (or such shorter period as the relevant parties may agree) with a view to coordinating the
instructions to be given by an Instructing Group and agreeing an enforcement strategy (the ‘‘Consultation
Period’’).

No such consultation shall be required (and an Instructing Group shall be entitled to give any
instructions to the Fixed Asset Security Agent to enforce the Fixed Asset Collateral or take any other
Enforcement Action prior to the end of the Consultation Period, in each case provided such instructions
comply with the Security Enforcement Principles set forth below (‘‘Qualifying Instructions’’)) where:

(a) any of the Fixed Asset Collateral has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency event
affecting any Debtor; or

144


-----

(b) the Instructing Group or, as applicable, the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority First
Lien Creditors determine in good faith (and notifies each other Representative of the other
Secured Creditors and the Fixed Asset Security Agent) that any delay caused by such
consultation could reasonably be expected (A) to reduce the amount likely to be realized to a
level such that (following application in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall
described in the section ‘‘—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral’’) the payments then
due and payable to the Super Senior Creditors would not be discharged in full or (B) to have a
material adverse effect on the ability to effect an Enforcement or a Distressed Disposal and, in
each case any instructions will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of
the Creditors, on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is acting and the Fixed Asset
Security Agent shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

If following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority First
Lien Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, shall be instructed
to implement the same.

Subject to the paragraph below, in the event that conflicting instructions (and for these purposes
silence is deemed to be a conflicting instruction) are received from either Instructing Group by the end of
the Consultation Period (which have not be resolved), the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall enforce the
Fixed Asset Collateral and/or refrain from enforcing the Fixed Asset Collateral and/or take the relevant
other Enforcement Action in accordance with the instructions provided by the Majority First Lien
Creditors, in each case provided such instructions are Qualifying Instructions and the terms of all
instructions received by the Majority First Lien Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed
revoked.

If prior to the Super Senior Discharge Date:

(a) the Super Senior Obligations have not been repaid in full in cash within six months of the end of
the Consultation Period (or within six months of the event of default giving rise to the right to
commence an Enforcement if no such Consultation Period is required);

(b) the Fixed Asset Security Agent has not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu)
or other Enforcement Action within three months of the end of the Consultation Period (or
within three months of the event of default giving rise to the right to commence an Enforcement
if no such Consultation Period is required); or

(c) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to a Debtor and the Fixed Asset Security Agent has
not commenced any Enforcement (or any transaction in lieu) or other Enforcement Action at
that time with respect to such Debtor,

then the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall thereafter follow any instructions that are subsequently given by
the Majority Super Senior Creditors (in each case provided the same are Qualifying Instructions and the
Fixed Asset Security Agent shall be entitled to assume that any instructions for enforcement given to it are
Qualifying Instructions) to the exclusion of those given by the Majority First Lien Creditors (to the extent
conflicting with any instructions previously given by the Majority First Lien Creditors).

_Security Enforcement Principles_

Unless otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement, until the Fixed Asset Discharge Date
enforcement of the Fixed Asset Collateral must be conducted in accordance with the ‘‘Security
Enforcement Principles,’’ which are summarized as follows:

(a) It shall be the priority and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Fixed Asset Collateral to
maximize, so far as is consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value from

145


-----

enforcement of the Fixed Asset Collateral, and in a manner consistent with the Intercreditor
Agreement, the recovery by the Fixed Asset Creditors (the ‘‘Security Enforcement Objective’’)
subject to applicable law.

(b) The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written
consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the First Lien Notes Trustee and any other
Representative of First Lien Obligations and (to the extent relating to the definition of ‘‘Security
Enforcement Objective’’ or paragraph (a) above) the Majority Second Lien Creditors.

(c) Without prejudice to the Security Enforcement Objective, the Fixed Asset Collateral will, subject
to applicable law, be enforced and other action as to Enforcement will be taken such that either
(1) all proceeds of Enforcement are received by the Fixed Asset Security Agent in cash (or
substantially all cash) for distribution in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall
described in the section ‘‘—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral’’; or (2) sufficient
proceeds of Enforcement will be received by the Fixed Asset Security Agent in cash to ensure
that when the proceeds are applied in accordance with the application of proceeds waterfall
described in the section ‘‘—Application of proceeds—Fixed Asset Collateral,’’ the Super Senior
Obligations are repaid and discharged in full (unless the Majority Super Senior Creditors agree
otherwise).

(d) On (i) a proposed Enforcement of any of the Fixed Asset Collateral other than shares in a
member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets exceeds a threshold (or its
equivalent); or (ii) a proposed Enforcement of any Fixed Asset Collateral consisting of some or
all of the shares in a member of the Group, the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall (unless such
enforcement or sale is made pursuant to a public auction, a public offering or process supervised
by a court of law which makes a determination as to value) obtain an opinion from a reputable
internationally recognized investment bank or international accounting firm or other reputable,
third-party professional firm that is regularly engaged in providing valuations of businesses or
assets similar or comparable to such Fixed Asset Collateral to be enforced (a ‘‘Financial
Advisor’’) to opine as expert (A) on the optimal method of enforcing the Fixed Asset Collateral
so as to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective and maximize recovery, (B) that the
proceeds received from enforcement is fair from a financial point of view after taking into
account all relevant circumstances, and (C) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the
Security Enforcement Principles, provided that the provider of such opinion may limit its liability
in respect of such opinion to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

(e) The Fixed Asset Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a Financial Advisor or to
seek the advice of a Financial Advisor, unless expressly required to do so by the Intercreditor
Agreement.

_Enforcement Through Fixed Asset Security Agent Only_

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, until the Fixed Asset Discharge Date the Secured Creditors shall
have no independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Fixed Asset Collateral or to exercise
any right, power, authority or discretion arising under the Fixed Asset Security Documents except through
the Fixed Asset Security Agent.

_Alternative Enforcement Actions_

After the Fixed Asset Security Agent has commenced enforcement, it shall not accept any subsequent
instructions as to enforcement from anyone other than the relevant Instructing Group regarding any other
enforcement of the Fixed Asset Collateral over or relating to shares or assets directly or indirectly the
subject of the Enforcement of the Fixed Asset Collateral which has been commenced.

146


-----

_Manner of Enforcement—ABL Collateral_

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, until the ABL Discharge Date, the ABL Security
Agent and the ABL Creditors shall have the right to enforce rights, exercise remedies (including setoff,
recoupment and the right to credit bid their debt) and, in connection therewith (including voluntary
dispositions of ABL Collateral by the respective Debtor after an event of default under the ABL Credit
Agreement), make determinations regarding the release, disposition, or restrictions with respect to the
ABL Collateral (including, without limitation, exercising remedies under any control agreements and
dominion accounts), without any consultation with or the consent of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or any
Fixed Asset Creditor; provided, however, that the liens securing Fixed Asset Obligations (x) shall remain on
the proceeds (other than any proceeds properly applied to the ABL Obligations) of any ABL Collateral
released or disposed of, subject to the relative priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement and
(y) shall be released in the case of any release of liens by the ABL Security Agent on ABL Collateral in
accordance with the terms under the heading ‘‘—Release of Liens’’ below.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that until the ABL Discharge Date, whether or not any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against any Debtor neither the Fixed
Asset Security Agent or any other Fixed Asset Creditor will (a) exercise or seek to exercise (and instead
shall be deemed to have irrevocably, absolutely and unconditionally waived, but solely to the extent
necessary to further the purpose of this section) any rights, powers or remedies with respect to the ABL
Collateral, or (b) commence or join with any person (in each case other than the ABL Agent and the ABL
Security Agent) in commencing, or filing a petition for, any insolvency or liquidation proceeding against
any Debtor, in the case of clauses (a) and (b), at any time prior to the passage of a period of at least
180 days has elapsed (subject to the tolling of such period as described in clause (x) below) since the later
of: (A) the date on which the Fixed Asset Security Agent declared the existence of an event of default
under any Debt Document governing Fixed Asset Obligations and demanded the repayment of all of the
principal amount of any Fixed Asset Obligations and (B) the date on which the ABL Security Agent
received notice from the Fixed Asset Security Agent of such declaration of such a default and such demand
for repayment (the ‘‘Fixed Asset Standstill Period’’); (x) if any of the ABL Security Agent or the other
ABL Creditors are stayed or otherwise prohibited from commencing and continuing to exercise any
Enforcement Action or to liquidate or sell any ABL Collateral by operation of law, court order or
otherwise, then the 180-day period shall be tolled during the pendency of such stay or other prohibition,
plus an additional number of days such that the Fixed Asset Standstill Period extends at least 45 days after
the applicable stay or other prohibition on enforcement are no longer in effect; and (y) notwithstanding
anything in the Intercreditor Agreement to the contrary, in no event will the Fixed Asset Security Agent or
any other Fixed Asset Creditor exercise any rights or remedies with respect to the ABL Collateral if,
notwithstanding the expiration of the Fixed Asset Standstill Period, the ABL Security Agent or any ABL
Creditor shall have commenced and are diligently pursuing the exercise of their rights or remedies with
respect to all or any material portion of the ABL Collateral (prompt notice of such exercise to be given to
the Fixed Asset Security Agent).

On or promptly following the ABL Discharge Date, to the extent permitted by applicable law (unless
any other person has made a demand therefor and is lawfully entitled thereto or unless a court of
competent jurisdiction otherwise directs), the ABL Security Agent shall, without recourse or warranty,
take commercially reasonable steps to deliver to the Fixed Asset Security Agent any Collateral and
proceeds of Collateral held by it as a result of the exercise of remedies in the same form as received, with
any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct to be applied by
the Fixed Asset Security Agent to the Fixed Asset Obligations; it being understood that any security
interest in deposit accounts, securities accounts or commodities accounts in favor of the Fixed Asset
Obligations may no longer exist upon the ABL Discharge Date, and the ABL Security Agent shall not be
required to take any action in connection with such accounts or any assets deposited therein or credited

147


-----

thereto. Similar terms shall apply, following the Fixed Asset Discharge Date, to the Fixed Asset Security
Agent.

_Permitted Actions_

Notwithstanding the provisions described in this section ‘‘—Enforcement of security’’ or any
restrictions on Creditors undertaking any Enforcement Action, either Security Agent and any Creditor of
any class may (i) file a claim or statement of interest with respect to the Obligations of such class, provided
that an insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against any Debtor, (ii) take any
action in order to create, perfect, preserve or protect its lien on any of the Collateral; provided that such
action shall not be inconsistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and shall not be adverse to
the priority status of the liens of the Security Agents on the Collateral, or the rights of the Security Agents
or the other Creditors to exercise remedies in respect thereof as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement,
(iii) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim,
adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the
disallowance of its claims or liens, in each case in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) file
any pleadings, objections, motions or agreements that assert rights or interests available to unsecured
creditors of any Debtor arising under either any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or applicable
non-bankruptcy law, in each case not inconsistent with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, (v) vote
on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, file any proof of claim, make other
filings and make any arguments and motions that are, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement (subject to the proviso in clause (ii) above), or (vi) exercise any of its other rights
or remedies with respect to any of the Collateral to the extent permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Entry Upon Premises by ABL Security Agent and ABL Creditors_

If the Fixed Asset Security Agent, or any agent, representative or affiliate of the Fixed Asset Security
Agent, any Fixed Asset Creditor or any receiver, shall obtain possession or physical control of any real
properties subject to a Fixed Asset Security Document that constitute Fixed Asset Collateral or any
material portion of the tangible Fixed Asset Collateral located on any premises other than real properties
subject to a Fixed Asset Security Document, the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall promptly notify the ABL
Security Agent in writing of that fact (such notice, a ‘‘Notice of Occupancy’’) and the ABL Security Agent
shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, notify the Fixed Asset Security Agent in writing if and when the
ABL Security Agent desires to exercise its access rights as outlined in this section (such rights, the ‘‘ABL
Access Rights’’). Upon delivery of such notice by the ABL Security Agent to the Fixed Asset Security
Agent, the parties shall confer in good faith to coordinate with respect to the ABL Security Agent’s
exercise of such access rights; _provided, that it is understood and agreed that the Fixed Asset Security_
Agent shall obtain possession or physical control of such real properties in the manner provided in the
applicable Fixed Asset Security Documents and in the manner provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.
Access rights may apply to differing parcels of real property at differing times, in which case, a differing
Access Period may apply to each such property. ‘‘Access Period’’ means the period, with respect to any
Fixed Asset Collateral, which begins on the day that the ABL Security Agent provides the Fixed Asset
Security Agent with the notice of its election to exercise its ABL Access Rights with respect to such Fixed
Asset Collateral and ends on the earliest of (i) the 180th day after the date that the ABL Security Agent
obtains the ability to use, take physical possession of, remove or otherwise control the use or access to such
Fixed Asset Collateral plus such number of days, if any, after the ABL Security Agent obtains access to
such Collateral that it is stayed or otherwise prohibited by law or court order from exercising remedies with
respect to Collateral located on such property such that such Access Period extends at least 45 days after
the applicable stay or other prohibition on enforcement are no longer in effect, (ii) the date on which all or
substantially all of the ABL Collateral located on such property is sold, collected or liquidated, (iii) the
ABL Discharge Date and (iv) the date on which the event of default that gave rise to such enforcement
actions by ABL Security Agent has been cured or waived.

148


-----

During any such Access Period, the ABL Security Agent and its employees, agents, advisors,
representatives and designees (and persons employed on their respective behalves), may continue to
operate, service, maintain, process and sell the ABL Collateral, including by public auction, private sale or
a ‘‘store closing’’, going out of business sale or similar sale, whether in bulk, in lots or to customers in the
ordinary course of business or otherwise and which sale may include augmented inventory of the same type
sold in any Debtor’s business. The ABL Security Agent shall take proper care of any Fixed Asset Collateral
that is used by the ABL Security Agent during the Access Period and, subject to the protections and
immunities of the ABL Security Agent contained in the Intercreditor Agreement, shall procure the repair
and replacement of any damage (ordinary wear-and-tear excepted) to the Fixed Asset Collateral directly
caused by the ABL Security Agent or its employees, agents, advisors, representatives or designees and the
ABL Security Agent shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws (and the ABL Security
Agent my rely on advice received by legal counsel in connection therewith) in connection with its use or
occupancy of the Fixed Asset Collateral. The ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall (only
and solely to the extent that there are sufficient available proceeds of ABL Collateral, that ABL Creditors
(other than the ABL Security Agent and the ABL Agent) have or are entitled to receive, for the purposes
of paying such indemnity) indemnify and hold harmless the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other
Fixed Asset Creditors for any injury or damage to persons or property (ordinary wear-and-tear excepted)
caused by the acts or omissions of the ABL Security Agent or its employees, agents, advisors,
representatives or designees; provided that the ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors shall not
be liable for any diminution in the value of the Fixed Asset Collateral caused by the absence or removal of
the ABL Collateral therefrom. In no event shall the ABL Creditors or the ABL Security Agent have any
liability to the Fixed Asset Creditors and/or to the Fixed Asset Security Agent as a result of (i) any
environmental condition, claim, damage, loss or liability existing prior to or after the date of exercise by the
ABL Security Agent of its ABL Access Rights with respect to that Fixed Asset Collateral, except as may be
directly caused by the ABL Security Agent, or (ii) any condition, claim, damage, loss or liability on or with
respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral (x) existing prior to the date of the exercise by the ABL Security
Agent of its ABL Access Rights with respect to such Fixed Asset Collateral or (y) not directly caused by or
resulting from the actions taken or not taken by the ABL Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent and the
Fixed Asset Security Agent shall cooperate and use reasonable efforts to ensure that their activities during
the Access Period as described above do not interfere materially with the activities of the other as
described above, including the right of the Fixed Asset Security Agent to show the Fixed Asset Collateral
to prospective purchasers and to ready the Fixed Asset Collateral for sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no circumstance whatsoever in connection with the ABL Security Agent’s activities as described above
shall the ABL Security Agent (i) be required to expend its own funds in indemnifying any party or
repairing or replacing (or the procurement thereof) of any damage to any Fixed Asset Collateral, or (ii) be
liable to any party for any repair, condition, claim, damage, loss or injury in respect of the Fixed Asset
Collateral; provided the ABL Security Agent is acting without gross negligence or willful misconduct.

In the event that the ABL Security Agent elects to exercise its access rights as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Fixed Asset Security Agent agrees, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed
Asset Creditors, that in the event that the Fixed Asset Security Agent exercises its rights to sell or
otherwise dispose of any real property, whether before or after the delivery of a Notice of Occupancy to
the ABL Security Agent, the Fixed Asset Security Agent shall (i) provide access rights to the ABL Security
Agent for the duration of the Access Period in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) if
such a sale or other disposition occurs prior to the ABL Security Agent delivering its notice of its desire to
exercise its ABL Access Rights during the time period provided therefor, or if applicable, the expiration of
the applicable Access Period, shall ensure that the purchaser or other transferee of such real property
provides the ABL Security Agent the opportunity to exercise its access rights, and upon delivery of such a
notice to such purchaser or transferee, continued access rights to the ABL Collateral for the duration of
the applicable Access Period, in the manner and to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement.

149


-----

_No Interference; Reinstatement; Tracing of Proceeds_

Each Fixed Asset Creditor agrees that, prior to the ABL Discharge Date, whether or not any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against any Debtor:

(i) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or
indirectly (including by joining or directing any other Person to), contest, or support any other
person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the
extent, attachment, perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a lien held, or allowability of
any claims asserted, by or on behalf of any of the ABL Creditors in the Collateral (or the extent,
attachment, perfection, priority, validity, enforceability or allowability of any ABL Security
Document or any ABL Obligations secured thereby or purported to be secured thereby), or the
provisions or enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that nothing in the_
Intercreditor Agreement will be construed to prevent or impair the rights of the Fixed Asset
Security Agent to enforce the Intercreditor Agreement;

(ii) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or
indirectly (including by joining or directing any other Person to), contest, protest or object to, or
otherwise interfere with, any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the ABL Security
Agent or any other ABL Creditor or any other exercise by the ABL Security Agent or any other
ABL Creditor of any rights and remedies relating to the ABL Collateral, whether under the ABL
Documents or otherwise;

(iii) it will not (and it hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to), directly or
indirectly (including by joining or directing any other Person to), object to the forbearance by the
ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor from bringing or pursuing any collateral
enforcement action or any other proceeding, action, or the exercise of any right or remedy
relating to the ABL Collateral; and

(iv) it will not assert, and it waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any right to demand,
request, plead or otherwise assert or otherwise claim the benefit of, any marshalling, appraisal,
valuation or other similar right that may otherwise be available under applicable law with respect
to the ABL Collateral or any other similar rights a junior secured creditor or unsecured creditor
may have under applicable law.

The ABL Security Agent, on its behalf and on behalf of the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar
limitations to those described in clauses (i) through (iv) above with respect to their rights in the Fixed
Asset Collateral and their ability to bring a suit against the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed
Asset Creditors.

To the extent any payment with respect to any ABL Obligation is rescinded for any reason whatsoever
or declared to be or avoided as a fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, or a preference in any
respect, set aside or required to be turned over or otherwise paid to a debtor in possession or trustee in
bankruptcy (a ‘‘Recovery’’), any Fixed Asset Creditor, receiver or similar person, whether in connection
with any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or otherwise, then the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and
obligations of the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset Creditors, be deemed to be reinstated and
outstanding as if such payment had not occurred. If the Intercreditor Agreement is terminated prior to
such Recovery, the Intercreditor Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior
termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties
thereto from such date of reinstatement. To the extent that any interest, fees, expenses or other charges
(including, without limitation, post-petition interest and all amounts accruing on or after the
commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding relating to any Debtor, or that would have
accrued or become due under the terms of the ABL Documents but for the effect of the insolvency or

150


-----

liquidation proceeding) to be paid pursuant to the ABL Documents are disallowed by order of any court,
such interest, fees, expenses and charges shall, as between the ABL Creditors and the Fixed Asset
Creditors, be deemed to continue to accrue and be added to the amount to be calculated as the ‘‘ABL
Obligations.’’ The ABL Creditors will be subject to similar limitations with respect to the Fixed Asset
Collateral and any proceeds or payments in respect of any Fixed Asset Collateral.

The Intercreditor Agreement will also provide that prior to an issuance of a notice of enforcement of
remedies by a Security Agent or any other Secured Creditor, (i) all funds deposited in an account subject
to a control agreement or dominion account that constitutes ABL Collateral and then applied to the ABL
Obligations shall be treated as ABL Collateral and, unless the ABL Security Agent has actual knowledge
to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the ABL Security Agent through the deposit accounts
and securities accounts that are subject to such control agreements or dominion accounts, respectively are
proceeds of or otherwise constitute Fixed Asset Collateral are waived by the Fixed Asset Creditors, (ii) all
funds deposited in any account not forming a part of the ABL Collateral and then applied to the Fixed
Asset Obligations shall be treated as Fixed Asset Collateral and, unless the Fixed Asset Security Agent has
actual knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the Fixed Asset Security Agent through
such account are proceeds of or otherwise constitute ABL Collateral are waived by the ABL Creditors, and
(iii) any proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited in an account subject to a control agreement or a
securities account control agreement, shall not (as between the Security Agents, the ABL Creditors and
the Fixed Asset Creditors) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of determining the relative
priorities in the Collateral.

The ABL Creditors agree that the Fixed Asset Creditors and the Fixed Asset Security Agent have no
duty to the ABL Creditors in respect of the maintenance or preservation of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the
ABL Collateral, the Fixed Asset Obligations, or otherwise. The Fixed Asset Creditors agree that the ABL
Creditors and the ABL Security Agent have no duty to the Fixed Asset Creditors in respect of the
maintenance or preservation of the ABL Collateral, Fixed Asset Collateral, the ABL Obligations, or
otherwise.

_Consent to License to Use Property_

Without limiting any rights any of the ABL Creditors may otherwise have under applicable law or by
agreement and whether or not the Fixed Asset Security Agent has commenced and is continuing to
undertake any Enforcement Action or is otherwise exercising any rights, powers or remedies with respect
to the Collateral, the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the Debtors will grant under the Intercreditor
Agreement (to the full extent of their respective rights and interests) to the ABL Security Agent an
irrevocable, non-exclusive worldwide right to have access to, and a worldwide, royalty-free (and also free of
any other obligation of payment), non-exclusive license (or, as applicable, sublicense, to the extent
permitted without requiring payment to any third party or obtaining any consent or waiver of any third
party) and right to use the Fixed Asset Collateral, including, without limitation, intellectual property,
intellectual property rights, general intangibles and real property and equipment, processors, computers
and other machinery related to the storage or processing of records, documents or files, (i) to access the
ABL Collateral and (ii) to assemble, inspect, copy or download information stored on, take actions to
perfect its lien on, process raw materials or work-in-process into finished inventory, take possession of,
move, package, prepare and advertise for sale or disposition, sell (by public auction, private sale or a
‘‘going out of business’’ or similar sale, whether in bulk, in lots or to customers in the ordinary course of
business or otherwise and which sale may include augmented inventory of the same type sold in Debtors’
business), store, collect, take reasonable actions to protect, secure and otherwise enforce the rights of ABL
Security Agent in and to the ABL Collateral, or otherwise deal with the ABL Collateral, in each case
without the involvement of or interference by any of the Fixed Asset Creditors, including in connection
with any Enforcement Action commenced by, or the exercising of any rights, powers or remedies with
respect to the ABL Collateral by, the ABL Security Agent, or in connection with the sale or other

151


-----

disposition of, or collection on, such ABL Collateral during the continuance of an event of default under
the ABL Documents that is consented to in writing by the ABL Security Agent.

_Release of Liens_

If in connection with a Disposition (as defined below) of ABL Collateral pursuant to the terms of the
ABL Documents, the exercise of the ABL Security Agent’s remedies in respect of any ABL Collateral, or
in connection with the sale or other disposition of, or collection on, such ABL Collateral during the
continuance of an event of default under the ABL Documents that is consented to in writing by the ABL
Security Agent, the ABL Security Agent, for itself or on behalf of any ABL Creditor releases any of its
liens on any part of the ABL Collateral, then the liens, if any, of the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself
or for the benefit of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, on the ABL Collateral Disposed of in connection
with such exercise, will be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The ABL Security
Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to a similar release of their liens on the Fixed Asset
Collateral under comparable circumstances provided that, in the case of any such transaction directly or
indirectly involving a member of the Group a portion of whose assets consist of ABL Collateral, (i) the
Debtors shall have complied with the terms of the ABL Documents prior to such release, including the
repayment (or assumption by another borrower) of any ABL Obligations required to be paid (or assumed)
under the ABL Documents as a result of such transaction and (ii) such release shall be in accordance with
terms set forth below the heading ‘‘—Application of Proceeds and Releases Involving a Combination of
ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset Collateral.’’

_Application of Proceeds and Releases Involving a Combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset_
_Collateral_

Notwithstanding anything contained in this description or the Intercreditor Agreement to the
contrary:

(a) in the event that any proceeds of Collateral received in connection with any (w) Enforcement
Action, (x) Distressed Disposal, (y) Non-Distressed Disposal, or (z) other sale, transfer or
disposition by or on behalf or at the direction of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or any other
Fixed Asset Creditor (any such event under clauses (x) through (z), a ‘‘Disposition’’) involving a
Debtor involves a combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed Asset Collateral or any Enforcement
Action or Disposition involving equity interests of a person that is, or directly or indirectly owns,
a member of the Group a portion of whose assets consist of ABL Collateral (whether or not
other Fixed Asset Collateral or ABL Collateral is directly involved in such Enforcement Action
or Disposition), then, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and unless otherwise
expressly agreed to by the ABL Agent and the Instructing Group in writing with respect to the
applicable Enforcement Action or Disposition, (x) a portion of such proceeds shall first be
allocated to the ABL Collateral in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the book value, as
determined in accordance with IFRS (but not less than cost), of any ABL Collateral consisting of
inventory that is directly or indirectly the subject of such Enforcement Action or Disposition
(including any inventory owned by a Person the equity interests of which are directly or indirectly
the subject of such Enforcement Action or Disposition), determined as of the date of such
Enforcement Action or Disposition, (ii) the book value, as determined in accordance with IFRS,
of any ABL Collateral consisting of accounts or other accounts receivables that are the subject of
the Enforcement Action or Disposition (including any accounts or other accounts receivables
owned by a Person the equity interests of which are directly or indirectly the subject of such
Enforcement Action or Disposition) which results in such proceeds, determined as of the date of
such Enforcement Action or Disposition, and (iii) the fair market value, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, of all other ABL Collateral that is the subject of such Enforcement Action
or Disposition (including any other ABL Collateral owned by a person the equity interests of

152


-----

which are directly or indirectly the subject of such Enforcement Action or Disposition),
determined as of the date of such Enforcement Action or Disposition, and (y) any proceeds not
allocated under clause (x) to the ABL Collateral shall be allocated to the Fixed Asset Collateral;
and

(b) the liens and security interests granted to the ABL Creditors in respect of the Collateral subject
to any transaction described in clause (a) above shall not be, and shall not be required to be,
released by the ABL Creditors unless the Debtors shall have complied with the terms of the ABL
Documents prior to such release and (other than any Non-Distressed Disposal) the proceeds of
such transaction attributable to ABL Collateral in accordance with clause (a) above have been
(or will substantially simultaneously be) paid over to the ABL Security Agent for application to
the ABL Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL
Documents.

_Waiver of Rights, etc._

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject
to the sections ‘‘—Enforcement of security,’’ ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’ and ‘‘—Proceeds of disposals—
Distressed Disposals,’’ each of the Secured Creditors, the Debtors and other grantors of Fixed Asset
Collateral and the ABL Collateral waives all rights it may otherwise have to require that the Fixed Asset
Collateral or the ABL Collateral be enforced in any particular order or manner or at any particular time or
that any sum received or recovered from any person, or by virtue of the enforcement of any of the Fixed
Asset Collateral, ABL Collateral or of any other security interest, which is capable of being applied in or
towards discharge of any of the Secured Obligations is so applied. No Security Agent or any Primary
Creditor shall be responsible to any Intra-Group Lender, Subordinated Creditor, Debtor or other grantor
of Collateral for any enforcement or failure to enforce or maximize the proceeds of any enforcement of the
Debt Documents, to an extent greater than as provided under any applicable governing law of a Debt
Document.

**_Proceeds of Disposals_**

In this section:

‘‘Distress Event’’ means an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Fixed Asset Collateral in
accordance with the Fixed Asset Security Documents.

‘‘Distressed Disposal’’ means a disposal of equity interests of a member of the Group or any asset (not
constituting ABL Collateral) of a member of the Group, in each case, which is being effected (a) at the
request of the relevant Instructing Group in circumstances where the Fixed Asset Collateral has become
enforceable, (b) by enforcement, or simultaneous with the enforcement, of the Fixed Asset Collateral
(including the disposal of any property of a member of the Group, the shares of which have been subject to
an appropriation which is expressly permitted by the terms of the relevant Fixed Asset Security
Documents) or (c) after the occurrence of a Distress Event, by or on behalf of a Debtor to a person or
persons which is, or are, not a member, or members, of the Group.

_Non-Distressed Disposals of Fixed Asset Collateral_

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain certain provisions governing the disposal of an asset which
is the subject of Fixed Asset Collateral and which is subject to receipt of instructions by the Fixed Asset
Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the provisions described
under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds and Releases Involving a Combination of ABL Collateral and Fixed
Asset Collateral.’’

153


-----

If, in respect of a disposal, sale or transfer other than a Distressed Disposal of an asset which is or
constitutes Fixed Asset Collateral by a Debtor, or any other transaction involving Fixed Asset Collateral,
(i) the Company certifies for the benefit of each Security Agent that that disposal, sale or transfer or other
transaction is permitted under the Debt Documents relating to the Primary Obligations (the ‘‘Primary
Debt Documents’’); or (ii) each relevant Representative authorizes the release in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Primary Debt Documents, then the Fixed Asset Security Agent will be irrevocably
authorized and obliged (A) to release its lien on such Fixed Asset Collateral or any other claim (relating to
a Primary Debt Document) over the Fixed Asset Collateral; (B) where that asset consists of shares in the
capital of a Debtor, to release its lien on such Fixed Asset Collateral or any other claim (relating to a
Primary Debt Document) over that Debtor’s assets consisting of Fixed Asset Collateral and, to the extent
that they are at such time being disposed of, sold or otherwise transferred in accordance with this
paragraph, the release its lien on assets consisting of Fixed Asset Collateral of any subsidiary of that
Debtor and, to the extent that they are at such time being disposed of, sold or otherwise transferred in
accordance with this paragraph, the release its lien on assets of such subsidiaries of that Debtor consisting
of Fixed Asset Collateral; and (C) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Fixed Asset
Collateral or any claim described in clause (A) above necessary or desirable (each such disposal, sale,
transfer or other transaction, a ‘‘Non-Distressed Disposal’’).

The above provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be construed to impose any condition
to the release of Fixed Asset Collateral that, by the terms of each applicable Debt Documents is
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the disposal, sale or transfer of the
applicable asset or consummation of the applicable transaction (including upon the release of a
guarantor’s guarantee of the Unsecured Obligations).

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the proceeds of a Non-Distressed Disposal are
required to be applied in mandatory prepayment of any of the Obligations or to be offered to any parties
pursuant to the terms of the relevant Debt Documents, then such proceeds shall, subject to any restriction
on the making of payments set out in the Intercreditor Agreement or the Debt Documents, be applied in
or towards payment of such Obligations or shall be offered to the relevant parties in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Debt Documents.

_Distressed Disposals_

those described under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds and Releases Involving a Combination of ABL Collateral
_and Fixed Asset Collateral’’) and receipt by the Fixed Asset Security Agent of instructions pursuant to the_
Intercreditor Agreement, if a Distressed Disposal is being effected, the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide that the Fixed Asset Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and without any consent, sanction,
authority or further confirmation:

(a) to release the liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral or any other claim over the asset subject to the
Distressed Disposal (other than any ABL Collateral or any Obligations or claims which constitute

Asset Collateral or claim (other than any ABL Collateral or any Obligations or claims which
constitute ABL Obligations) and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating charge or
any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Fixed Asset Security Agent, be
considered necessary or desirable;

Obligations; (II) its guarantee Obligations; and (III) its other Obligations; (B) any liens granted

claim of a Subordinated Creditor, an Intra-Group Lender or another Debtor or other grantor of
Fixed Asset Collateral over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that

(B) the Obligations (other than the Agent Obligations and the ABL Obligations) owed by that
Debtor or holding company or any subsidiary of that Debtor or holding company then: (I) if the
Fixed Asset Security Agent does not intend that any transferee of those Obligations or that
Debtor’s Obligations (the ‘‘Transferee’’) will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured
Creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, to enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part
of those Obligations or that Debtor’s Obligations; _provided, that notwithstanding any other_
provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee is not treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured
Creditor for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and (II) if the Fixed Asset Security
Agent does intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Primary Creditor or a Secured Creditor
for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of: (1) all (and not part only) of the Obligations (other than the Agent
Obligations and the ABL Obligations) owed to the Primary Creditors; and (2) all or part of any
other Obligations (other than the Agent Obligations and the ABL Obligations) and the Debtor
Obligations, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors and Debtors; and

(e) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the
holding company of a Debtor (the ‘‘Disposed Entity’’) and the Fixed Asset Security Agent

Entity’’) all or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of
that Disposed Entity in respect of: the Intra-Group Obligations, any Obligations owed to other
Debtors or members of the Group (‘‘Debtor Obligations’’), the Subordinated Obligations; to
execute and deliver and enter into any agreement to: (I) agree to the transfer of all or part of the
obligations in respect of those Intra-Group Obligations, Debtor Obligations or Subordinated
Obligations on behalf of the relevant Intra-Group Lenders, Debtors or, as the case may be, the
Subordinated Creditors to which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which
owe those obligations; and (II) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of
those Intra-Group Obligations, Debtor Obligations or Subordinated Obligations on behalf of the
Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those Intra-Group
Obligations, Debtor Obligations or Subordinated Obligations, as the case may be, are to be
transferred.

The Intercreditor Agreement will require that the net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the
net proceeds of any disposal of Obligations), in each case effected pursuant to clauses (a) through

155

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

The following is a description of the $2,150.0 million (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of
(a) A million % senior secured fixed rate notes due 2026 (the ‘‘Senior Secured Euro Fixed
_Rate Notes’’) and A_ million % senior secured floating rate notes due 2026 (the ‘‘Senior
_Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes’’ and together with the Senior Secured Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the_
‘‘Senior Secured Euro Notes’’) and (b) $900.0 million % senior secured fixed rate notes due 2026
(the ‘‘Senior Secured Dollar Notes’’ and together with the Senior Secured Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the
‘‘Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes’’). The Senior Secured Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Senior Secured Euro
Floating Rate Notes and the Senior Secured Dollar Notes each constitute a separate series of Senior
Secured Notes (as defined below). For the purposes of this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ the
Senior Secured Euro Notes and the Senior Secured Dollar Notes are together the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes.’’

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued by Trivium Packaging Finance B.V. (the ‘‘Issuer’’), a private
limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. You will find definitions of
certain capitalized terms used in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ under the heading ‘‘Certain
_Definitions’’ below. For purposes of this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes,’’ references to the_
‘‘Issuer,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ and ‘‘us’’ refer only to Trivium Packaging Finance B.V. and not to any of its
Subsidiaries. The term the ‘‘Company’’ refers to Trivium Packaging B.V.

The Issuer will issue the Senior Secured Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about the Issue
Date (the ‘‘Indenture’’), between, inter alios, the Issuer, the Company as guarantor, Citibank, N.A., London
Branch, as trustee (in such capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’) and as security agent (in such capacity, the ‘‘Security
Agent’’) and Citibank, N.A., London Branch as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject to
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate
by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, including
Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections provided under
the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including among
other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of interest and to inform
the Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement and release of the Escrowed
Property from the Escrow Accounts (each as defined below), the proceeds from the offering of the Senior
Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together with the proceeds from the
offering of the Senior Notes, to fund the cash portion of the consideration payable for the Combination
and pay the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, including estimated fees and
expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured Notes, as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum under the captions ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘The Transactions.’’

Pending the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described under the caption ‘‘Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ the Initial Purchasers (as defined in this Offering_
Memorandum) will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue
Date, deposit (i) the gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Senior Secured
Euro Floating Rate Notes sold on the Issue Date into a Euro-denominated escrow account and (ii) the
gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Dollar Notes sold on the Issue Date into a U.S. Dollar-denominated
escrow account ((i) and (ii) together, the ‘‘Escrow Accounts’’), in each case, pursuant to the terms of an
escrow agreement (the ‘‘Escrow Agreement’’) dated as of the Issue Date, among the Company, the Trustee
and Citibank, N.A., London Branch, as the escrow agent (the ‘‘Escrow Agent’’). If the conditions to the
release of the Escrowed Property (as defined below), as more fully described below under the caption
‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ have not been satisfied on the Business Day
following April 14, 2020 (the ‘‘Escrow Longstop Date’’), or upon the occurrence of certain other events,
each tranche of Senior Secured Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the issue price of such
tranche of Senior Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but excluding,

160


-----

the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) and Additional Amounts, if any. See ‘‘Escrow
_of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’_

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes
will only be obligations of the Company and the Issuer and will not be guaranteed by the Ardagh Carve-out
Business or Exal or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the

Prior to the Completion Date, the Company will not be able to cause the Ardagh Carve-out Business
or Exal to comply with the covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ or other
agreements under the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the
Ardagh Carve-out Business or Exal will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited
by the Indenture had those covenants or other agreements been applicable to such entities as of the Issue
Date, and any such non-compliance will not constitute a default or Event of Default under the Indenture.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Combination—Trivium may have liabilities that we are unaware of.’’

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which $2,150.0 million (equivalent)

Secured Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes or the Senior Secured
Dollar Notes, as applicable, such Additional Senior Secured Euro Fixed Rate Notes, Additional Senior
Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes or Additional Senior Secured Dollar Notes will be issued with a
separate ISIN code, CUSIP and/or common code, as applicable from the respective Senior Secured Notes
originally issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with
the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and
‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes, and if issued, Additional Senior Secured Notes, will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes,’’ references to the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes’’ include the Senior Secured Notes and any_
Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness

and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking
enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security
and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See ‘‘Description of
_Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement.

This ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ is intended to be an overview of the material provisions
of the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Charge and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge and the Security Documents for
complete descriptions of the obligations of the Company and your rights. Copies of such documents will be
made available from us upon request on and after the Issue Date.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
Only registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been, and will not be,
registered under the Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

   - be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (including the ABL Obligations
and certain Hedging Obligations);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes;

   - be effectively senior to the Issuer’s obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of
the Fixed Assets Collateral (as defined below);

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes or
that secure the Senior Secured Notes on a junior basis, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness (including the obligations under the ABL
Facility (as described under ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—ABL Facility’’), to the extent of the
value of the ABL Collateral (as defined below));

   - be effectively subordinated to obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the
ABL Collateral (as defined below);

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that are not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors;

   - be (i) guaranteed by the Company on a senior secured basis on the Issue Date and (ii) subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement and the occurrence of the Completion
Date, within 90 days from the Completion Date, guaranteed by the Post-Completion Date
Guarantors, in each case, on a senior secured basis, secured as set forth under ‘‘Security’’; and

162


-----

  - be represented by one or more registered Senior Secured Notes in global form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes (as defined
below). See ‘‘Book-entry; Delivery and Form.’’

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness of the
Company that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes (except that, in the case
of the certain Hedging Obligations and other future indebtedness, the creditors of such obligations may
receive all or a portion of the proceeds from the enforcement of security over the Collateral prior to the
Holders receiving any amounts under the Collateral) and the Holders will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of Collateral only after any indebtedness with a prior-ranking Lien on such Collateral is
repaid in full, including the obligations under the ABL Facility, in the case of the ABL Collateral.

The Issuer is a finance subsidiary with no business operations and has no revenue-generating
operations of its own. The Issuer will be dependent upon payments from the Company to meet its
obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The payments to the Issuer will
depend on the profitability and cash flows of the Company and its other Subsidiaries. The Senior Secured
Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and
commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will be a ‘‘Restricted Subsidiary’’ for the purposes of the Indenture, and
as of the Completion Date, we expect that all subsidiaries of the Company will be Restricted Subsidiaries
for the purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ we will be permitted to designate_
certain of our Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’ Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject
to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions (as defined in this Offering
Memorandum), we would have had total debt of $2,853 million (including $2,150.0 million (equivalent) in
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes, the $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of
Senior Notes and the new ABL Facility which is anticipated to provide for commitments of up to
$250.0 million with availability subject to conditions typical for asset based revolving credit facilities) of
which $2,246 million would have been secured.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by the Company on a senior secured
basis. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement and the occurrence of the
Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the
Post-Completion Date Guarantors by the earlier of (x) 90 days from the Completion Date or (y) the date
on which such Post-Completion Date Guarantors guarantee the obligations under the ABL Facility. In
addition, if required by the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,’’ certain
other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (as defined below) in the
future.

Once granted, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

   - be a general senior secured obligation of that Guarantor;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that
is not subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of that Guarantor
(including obligations under the ABL Facility, and certain Hedging Obligations);

163


-----

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (including the Senior
Notes Guarantees);

   - be effectively senior to the that Guarantor’s obligations under the ABL, to the extent of the value of
the Fixed Assets Collateral;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor
and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes
or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such indebtedness or securing the Senior Secured Notes on a junior basis (including the
obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the ABL Collateral);

   - be effectively subordinated to that Guarantor’s obligations under the ABL Facility, to the extent of
the value of the ABL Collateral; and

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that
Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes, including their obligations to trade
creditors.

defined below). Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate
Notes, including Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, will accrue at a rate that is 1.0% higher
than the interest rate on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes. In no event will the rate of interest
on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable
law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of
interest on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes:

‘‘Calculation Agent’’ means a financial institution appointed by the Issuer to calculate the interest rate
payable on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes in respect of each Interest Period, which shall
initially be Citibank N.A., London Branch.

‘‘EURIBOR’’ means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in Euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date that appears on Reuters page EURIBOR01 as of
11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Calculation Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never
be less than 0%. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on an Interest
Calculation Date, the Issuer will request the principal office of each of four major banks in the euro zone
inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer in consultation with the Calculation Agent, to provide such
bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (Brussels
time) on such Interest Calculation Date, to prime banks in the euro zone inter-bank market for deposits in
a Representative Amount in Euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so
provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than
two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as
selected by the Issuer, in consultation with the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as
a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Interest Calculation Date,
for loans in a Representative Amount in Euro to leading European banks for a three-month period
beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date. If at least
two such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such
rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period will
be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer
generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of
euro-denominated securities, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Senior
Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the euro-zone for the
purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of Euro-denominated securities, as identified
by the Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to
EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with an independent
financial advisor, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of
interest (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable
in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the
replacement of EURIBOR) on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes; provided, further, that any
such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0%. Following
the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to ‘‘EURIBOR’’ in the
Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. The Issuer shall promptly thereafter notify the

166


-----

holders of the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes and (via an Officer’s Certificate) the Calculation
Agent of the new rate replacing EURIBOR, and the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to rely on such
(without liability to any Person) as sufficient evidence thereof.

‘‘euro-zone’’ means the region comprised of the member states of the European Union that at such
time use the euro as their official currency.

‘‘Interest Calculation Date’’ means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first
day of such Interest Period in respect of the relevant Interest Period.

‘‘Interest Period’’ means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and
ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with
the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on, and include, the Issue Date and end on, and
exclude, 2019.

‘‘Representative Amount’’ means the greater of (i) A1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is
representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

‘‘Reuters Page EURIBOR01’’ means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, Bloomberg page ‘‘EBF’’ or such
other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the
information vendor).

‘‘TARGET Settlement Day’’ means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time
Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in Euro.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be
made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream for the Senior Secured Euro Notes or DTC in the case of the Senior Secured
Dollar Notes).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(‘‘Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes’’) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or
more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on
the Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed
by the Issuer to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders for the
Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes. See ‘‘Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes’’
below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes. The initial Paying
Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch (the ‘‘Paying Agent’’).

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ‘‘Registrar’’) and one or more transfer
agents (each, the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The initial Registrar will be Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG for
the Senior Secured Notes. The initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank, N.A., London Branch.

The Registrar and the Transfer Agent will maintain a register for the Senior Secured Notes reflecting
ownership of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the
Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of the Senior Secured Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

A register of the Holders shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency
between the register of Senior Secured Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its
registered office, the register kept by the Registrar shall prevail.

167


-----

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Secured Notes. The
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes.

**_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees_**

**_General_**

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes
will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles
and the Intercreditor Agreement and the occurrence of the Completion Date, the Post-Completion Date
Guarantors will guarantee, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis (each (including the Guarantee
of the Senior Secured Notes by the Company), a ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Guarantee’’ and together (including
the Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes by the Company), the ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Guarantees’’) the
obligations of the Company pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes, including any payment obligation
resulting from a Change of Control, by the earlier of (x) 90 days from the Completion Date or (y) the date
on which such Post-Completion Date Guarantors guarantee the obligations under the ABL Facility.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement and the occurrence of the
Completion Date, the Post-Completion Date Guarantors will be Ardagh MP Holdings UK Limited,
Ardagh Metal Packaging UK Limited, Ardagh Germany MP GmbH, Ardagh Metal Packaging
Germany GmbH, Ardagh MP Group Netherlands B.V., Ardagh Metal Packaging Netherlands B.V.,
Ardagh Aluminium Packaging Netherlands B.V., Ardagh Metal Packaging Hjørring A/S, Ardagh Metal
Packaging Canada Limited, Ardagh Metal Packaging Hungary Kft., Ardagh Aluminium Packing Hungary
Kft, Ardagh Metal Packaging Poland sp. z o.o., Ardagh Metal Packaging Iberica, S.A., Ardagh Metal
Packaging USA Inc., Element US Holding Company, Exal Corporation, and certain holding companies in
each of Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and France (the ‘‘Post-Completion Date Guarantors’’).

The Post-Completion Date Guarantors would have accounted for more than 61% of the aggregate
pro forma total assets, and 61% of the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of the Group as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions.

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified
Stock of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the
limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any
limitation on the Incurrence by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.’’_

In addition, as described under _‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’ and subject to the_
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
guarantee the ABL Facility or the Senior Secured Notes in the future or any other Credit Facility or Public
Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental senior secured notes
indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions
on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules,
fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims
and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the
benefit accruing to the Holders. See ‘‘Security—The Collateral’’

168


-----

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render
the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under
the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By
virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have
effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to
_Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations_
_on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests’’ and ‘‘—The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and other_
_local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction_
_with which you are familiar.’’_

A portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not
expected to become Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including
trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and
claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of
Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to
the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, including Holders. The Senior Secured Notes and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
stockholders (if any) of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority
stockholders of Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Combination—Trivium may have liabilities that we are unaware of.’’ As of March 31, 2019, on_
a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Company would have had, on a consolidated
basis, total debt of $2,853 million and total retirement benefit obligations of $312 million.

**_Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically terminate and be released:

(1) upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale,
exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes in accordance with the Indenture, as provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Satisfaction and
_Discharge,’’ respectively;_

(4) upon the release of the Guarantor’s Guarantee of any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes under the covenant described in
‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’; provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time
Guaranteed by the Guarantor that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide a
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’;_

(5) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

169


-----

(6) as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; provided that the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person is or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such Permitted Reorganization;

(8) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured
Notes; or

(9) as a result of a transaction permitted by ‘‘Merger and Consolidation.’’

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of the Company will automatically terminate and be released
only upon the circumstances described in clauses (3), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) set forth above.

The Trustee shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture,
take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Company, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of
the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Company will be required to make a notation on the Senior
Secured Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes of the Issuer will be secured on a first-priority basis by
Security Interests over the Escrowed Property deposited in the Escrow Accounts (the ‘‘Escrow Collateral’’)
(the ‘‘Issue Date Collateral’’). The Escrowed Property that is deposited in the Escrow Accounts will not be
charged to secure any obligations other than the Company’s obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Indenture. Upon the definitive release of the Escrowed Property, the first-priority Security
Interests over the Escrowed Property will be released.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by the earlier of (x) 90 days from the Completion Date or
(y) the date on which equivalent security is provided in respect of the obligations under the ABL Facility,
the Senior Secured Notes will be secured, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and certain perfection
requirements, by security interests and pledges granted on:

(i) an equal and ratable first-ranking/first-priority basis over the following property, rights and
assets:

(a) all assets (other than real property and the ABL Collateral) of Post-Completion Date
Guarantors incorporated in each of England & Wales and the United States; and

(b) certain shares of Post-Completion Date Guarantors incorporated in each of Canada (British
Columbia), Denmark, England & Wales, France, Hungary, Germany, The Netherlands,
Poland, Spain and the United States.

(collectively, the ‘‘Fixed Assets Collateral’’); and

170


-----

(ii) a junior basis over all of the assets that secure among other things, the obligations under the ABL
Facility on a first-ranking/first priority basis, including in any event but subject to limited
exceptions, including that the assets of the French Borrowers (as defined in the ABL Facility)
who are not Post-Completion Date Guarantors will not secure the Senior Secured Notes:

(a) all accounts (including accounts receivable), inventory, payment intangibles, and
instruments;

(b) all general intangibles, documents, chattel paper, letter of credit rights, supporting
obligations, and commercial tort claims evidencing, governing, securing, providing credit
support for, arising from or substituted for any of the foregoing;

(c) all deposit accounts, securities accounts, and commodity accounts;

(d) certain related assets; and

(e) all proceeds (including, without limitation, insurance proceeds) of any of the foregoing, of
the Post-Completion Date Guarantors in each of England & Wales, France, Germany, the
Netherlands and the United States.

(collectively, the ‘‘ABL Collateral’’ and, together with the Fixed Assets Collateral and the Issue Date
Collateral, the ‘‘Collateral’’); and

The Security Interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the
benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Security Documents. The Collateral may also secure certain future
Indebtedness, including certain Hedging Obligations and other future indebtedness; provided that, in the
case of certain Hedging Obligations and other future indebtedness, the creditors of such obligations may
receive all or a portion of the proceeds from the enforcement of security over the Collateral prior to the
Holders receiving any amounts under the Collateral. The Fixed Assets Collateral will also secure the
obligations under the ABL Facility, on a junior priority basis as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.
The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed
to the Holders.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Company_
and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with
future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including, subject to
certain requirements described herein, Additional Senior Secured Notes, as permitted under the Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of
the Holders and holders of certain of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any
other assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute
‘‘Collateral.’’ All Collateral pledged pursuant to the Security Documents will be subject to the limitations
that are applicable to Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the
Agreed Security Principles, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under
or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that
relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,’’ the Indenture will provide that certain property, rights and assets may_
not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not

perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. For a non-exhaustive summary of certain
terms of the Agreed Security Principles as they apply to the ABL Facility, and which will apply to the
Senior Secured Notes, mutatis mutandis, see ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—ABL Facility.’’

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Senior Secured
Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable
market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See
‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Secured Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Secured Notes
_and the Secured Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Secured Notes and_
_the Collateral securing the Secured Notes may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the
Security Documents (such security interests, and, as applicable, the security interests in the Escrow
Collateral, the ‘‘Security Interests’’ and each, a ‘‘Security Interest’’) as between (a) the lenders under the
ABL Facility, as described under ‘‘Description of Other Indebtedness—ABL Facility’’ (b) the counterparties
under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the
Indenture and (d) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including Indebtedness that may be
Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively, will be established by the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide, among other things, that with respect to the
Collateral, (i) the obligations under the ABL Facility, will be secured by senior priority liens on the ABL
Collateral and by junior priority liens on the Fixed Assets Collateral, (ii) the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured by senior priority liens on the Fixed Assets Collateral
and junior priority liens on the ABL Collateral and (iii) certain Hedging Obligations and certain other
indebtedness may receive all or portion of the proceeds from the enforcement of security over the
Collateral prior to the Holders receiving any amounts under the Collateral. See _‘‘Description of Other_
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.’’_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents and the Escrow Charge, the Company and other Guarantors will grant
security over the Collateral and the Escrow Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Company’s
and the Guarantors’ payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by the relevant security
provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering into such Security
Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the secured parties
(including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent also acts as an agent of the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to
the Security Interests created in favor of such parties.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, only the Security Agent (or, if the collateral represented by the Security Documents is held
by a creditor other than the Security Agent, that creditor) will have the right to enforce the Security
Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions,
Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent (or such creditor) for the Collateral (as applicable).

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by
Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture
have been discharged. However, the Security Interests with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the
Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under ‘‘—Release of Liens.’’

172


-----

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to
the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the
Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See ‘‘Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Secured Notes—The granting of the Security Interests in connection with the issuance of_
_the Secured Notes may create hardening periods for such Security Interests in accordance with the law_
_applicable in certain jurisdictions.’’_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee
to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under ‘‘Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’. The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar_
arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and
_the Guarantees—The insolvency laws of The Netherlands and other local insolvency laws may not be as_
_favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar.’’_

In addition, in the event the 30% Rule is triggered and certain shares of the Company are transferred
or issued to, and pledged by, a 30% Rule Designee, the Security Agent will be required, in the case of an
enforcement of the Collateral in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, to enforce such pledges separately
from the pledges provided by the Company over the shares of the Issuer in order to obtain control of 100%
of the share capital of the Issuer. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Secured Notes—The value of the
_Collateral securing the Secured Notes and the Secured Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our_
_obligations under the Secured Notes and the Collateral securing the Secured Notes may be reduced or diluted_
_under certain circumstances.’’_

The counterparties to Hedging Obligations that are secured by the Fixed Assets Collateral on a senior
priority basis and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed
to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Secured Note, will be deemed
(without any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are
specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing
such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and
comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any
waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the
Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf).

173


-----

See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Secured Notes—The Security Interests over the Collateral have
_been, or will be, granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Secured Notes. The ability_
_of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.’’_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’_

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more
of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation’’), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ and is otherwise not
prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that this clause 1(b) shall
not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts receivable (including
intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a
Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise
become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Senior Secured Notes following such sale or disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee pursuant to
the terms of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Guarantor;

(3) as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes
or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes, as provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge,’’ respectively;

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness
that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’;
_provided that in such a transaction where the Company or any Guarantor ceases to exist, the Lien_
on the Capital Stock of the Company or such Guarantor will be released and, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement, will reattach (or a new Lien will be
created) over the Capital Stock of the successor entity pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms
substantially equivalent to the existing Lien on the Capital Stock of the Company or such
Guarantor, as applicable) granted by the holder of such Capital Stock;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets,
and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture or

(10) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Escrow Collateral shall only be released upon the release of the Escrowed Property from the
Escrow Accounts in connection with the Escrow Release or the Special Mandatory Redemption, in each
case in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

174


-----

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released as may be
permitted by the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.’’

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant
Security Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without
the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect
such release). Except for the release of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge as described under
‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ the Security Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled
to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which
circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Security Interests has occurred, and that
such release complies with the Indenture.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the
Issuer will enter into the Escrow Agreement with, inter alios, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant
to which the Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross proceeds
of the Senior Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Accounts. The Escrow Accounts will
be pledged on a first-priority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to an escrow charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the
‘‘Escrow Charge’’). The initial funds deposited in the Escrow Accounts, and all other funds, securities,
interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Accounts (less
any property and/or funds paid in accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as
the ‘‘Escrowed Property.’’

On the Business Day prior to an interest payment date, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Paying
Agent from the respective Escrow Account an amount necessary to fund the respective interest payment.

Except in the circumstances described in the preceding paragraph, in order to cause the Escrow Agent
to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the ‘‘Closing Escrow Release’’), the Escrow Agent and the
Trustee shall have received from the Company on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, an Officer’s
Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall be able to rely conclusively without
further investigation, to the effect that all of the following conditions have been met or will be satisfied on
or prior to the Business Day immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date:

  - the Escrowed Property will be applied in substantially the same manner as described in this
Offering Memorandum;

  - the Combination will be consummated, or has already been consummated, on the terms set forth in
the Transaction Agreement (and on substantially the same terms as described in this Offering
Memorandum) promptly (and, in any event, no later than within three Business Days) following the
Closing Escrow Release, except for any changes, waivers or other modifications that will not,
individually or when taken as whole, have a material adverse effect on the Holders of the Senior
Secured Notes;

   - immediately after the Combination, the Company will own, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and outstanding share capital of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal; and

   - as of the delivery date of such Officer’s Certificate, there is no Default or Event of Default with
respect to the Issuer under clauses (5) or (9) of the first paragraph under the caption titled ‘‘Events
_of Default’’ below._

175


-----

The Closing Escrow Release shall occur promptly following receipt of such Officer’s Certificate. Upon
the Closing Escrow Release, the Escrow Accounts shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property
shall be paid out in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Business Day
immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) the Issuer notifies the Trustee and the Escrow Agent
that in their reasonable judgment the Combination will not be completed by the Business Day immediately
following the Escrow Longstop Date, (c) the Initial Investors cease to beneficially own and control a
majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Company, (d) the Transaction Agreement
terminates at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or (e) a Default or Event of Default arises with
respect to the Issuer under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the caption titled ‘‘Events of Default’’ on
or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the ‘‘Special Termination Date’’),
the Issuer will redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption’’) at a price
(the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Price’’) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Senior
Secured Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to
the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of Holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Written notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one
Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Escrow
Agent, and the Escrow Agreement and the Indenture will provide that the Senior Secured Notes shall be
redeemed on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Issuer in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Date’’). On the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay, on behalf of the Issuer, to the Paying
Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Senior
Secured Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property
(if any) to the Issuer.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory
Redemption exceeds the amount of the initial funds deposited in the Escrow Accounts and all other funds,
securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow
Accounts including accrued interest and Additional Amounts (if any) due with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (such excess, the ‘‘Escrow
Contribution Amount’’), Ardagh Group S.A. and Element Holdings II, L.P. will each be required under
the terms of the Transaction Agreement to fund to the Issuer half of the Escrow Contribution Amount.

Receipt by the Trustee from the Company of either an Officer’s Certificate for the Escrow Release or
a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release
of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the
Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority
that the Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special
Mandatory Redemption.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,’’ the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture.

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and
Clearstream (for the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or DTC (in the case of the Senior Secured Dollar Notes)
will credit their participants’ accounts on a pro rata pass-through distribution of principal basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions), or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including by
pool factor); provided, however, that no book-entry interest of less than A100,000 (with respect to the Senior
Secured Euro Notes) or $200,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) principal amount may
be redeemed in part. If the Senior Secured Notes are not held through Euroclear and Clearstream (for the
Senior Secured Euro Notes) or DTC (in the case of the Senior Secured Dollar Notes), or Euroclear and
Clearstream (for the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or DTC (in the case of the Senior Secured Dollar Notes)
prescribe no method of selection the Senior Secured Notes will be selected, on a pro rata basis, subject to
adjustments so that no Senior Secured Note in an unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after
such redemption; _provided,_ _however, that no Note of_ A100,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Euro
Notes) or $200,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) in aggregate principal amount or less
shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples of A1,000 (with respect to
the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or $1,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) shall be

the applicable procedures of Euroclear, Clearstream and/or DTC, except that redemption notices may be
delivered electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in
connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Secured Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to
the completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuer’s
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a
related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice of redemption shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that,
in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but not more than 60 days
after the date the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.
In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance
of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

If and for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if
and to the extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such
notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will
notify the Authority of any change in the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.

If any Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of
redemption that relates to that Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof to be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original
Definitive Registered Senior Secured Note. In the case of a global Senior Secured Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount
equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice
(including any conditions contained therein), Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due on
the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment

of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of them called for
redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be
irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’)
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under ‘‘Withholding Taxes,’’ if any,
then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or
otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation which is announced and
becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, where such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction becomes a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at a later date, after such later date); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the official application, administration or written interpretation
of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which is announced
and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, where such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction becomes
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at a later date, after such later date) (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes
would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case
of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or
another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and
such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). The
foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to
make at least one payment on the Senior Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person,
after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law
occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under ‘‘Selection and Notice.’’ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will
be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make
such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s
Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing
that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it
and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a ‘‘Payor’’) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the
relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or
on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax purposes,
or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(each of clause (1) and (2), a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with
respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments)
such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any
such withholding or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts
which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured
Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder,
if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership,
holding or disposition of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise
or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the Indenture or a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee);

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder
or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request
of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days
before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior
Secured Note for payment (where Senior Secured Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered
Senior Secured Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the
applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to
the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Senior Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

181


-----

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), as of the Issue Date (and any
amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous
to comply with), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder, or other official
administrative interpretations thereof and any agreements entered into pursuant to current
section 1471(b) of the Code, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version
described above), and including (for the avoidance of doubt) any intergovernmental agreement
(and any law, regulation or practice implementing any such intergovernmental agreement) in
respect of the foregoing; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that
the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or
beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

In addition, the Payor will pay, and reimburse each applicable Holder for, any present or future stamp,
issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest,
penalties or other similar liabilities with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or
similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto)
that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from (i) the execution, issuance, delivery or registration of the
Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto, or (ii) the receipt of any payments under or with respect to, or enforcement
of, the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any
such taxes attributable to the receipt of payments, to any such taxes that are not excluded under clauses (1)
through (3), (5), or (6) above).

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or
deduction, (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with
applicable law, and (iii) upon written request, will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes,
or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as
soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made
available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying
Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior
Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment,
the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant
payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the
relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as
practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s
Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

182


-----

Wherever in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’
there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior
Secured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or
through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change
of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith
delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under
‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to
A100,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or $200,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured
Dollar Notes) in principal amount or in integral multiples of A1,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured
Euro Notes) or $1,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) in excess thereof; provided that
Senior Secured Notes of A100,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or $200,000 (with
respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole
and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash
equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control,
the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy
to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise
in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for
the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days
and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by
the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer
made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations
described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the
SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender
offer satisfies certain conditions.

183


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Senior Secured
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under
the ABL Facility that permits the ABL Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings
thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on
certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased
upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of
Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior
Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and,
thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of
negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding
at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur
additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be_
waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if
(i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made
by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been
given pursuant to the Indenture as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a
default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not
consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to
be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of
Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the
Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

184


-----

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if
and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any
Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that:

(a) the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the
following headings (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’;

  - ‘‘—Additional Guarantees’’; and

   - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’.

If at any time the Senior Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the
Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the
‘‘Reversion Date’’) and will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection
with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture),
unless and until the Senior Secured Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the
Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Secured Notes maintain an
Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall
be deemed to exist under the Senior Secured Notes Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants
based on, and none of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with
respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension
Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the
Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable
Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of
suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any
Indebtedness Incurred under the ABL Facility) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date
so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.’’ On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be_
considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the
Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted_
_Payments’’ had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period._

185


-----

Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available
to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ On the Reversion Date,
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the
Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second
paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in the first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during the Suspension_
Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (1) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
_Subsidiaries.’’ On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be_
permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the
Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during
such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be released.
All such further obligation to grant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the
Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment
Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be
deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify
Holders of the Senior Secured Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the
Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been
satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to
be effective.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue Disqualified Stock and
will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; provided, however, (i) that the
Company and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired
Indebtedness) and the Company may issue Disqualified Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may
issue Preferred Stock, if on the date of such determination and after giving _pro forma effect thereto_
(including _pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the_
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to 1.00; and (ii) the amount of Indebtedness
Incurred and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to clause (i) above shall not cause the
Non Guarantor Debt Cap to be exceeded.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, ‘‘Permitted Debt’’):

(1) the Incurrence by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any
Credit Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed
the sum of:

(a) the aggregate of the greater of (x) $330.0 million and (y) the Borrowing Base; plus

(b) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that after giving pro forma effect
to such Incurrence the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries do not exceed 4.80 to 1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred

186


-----

under clause (a) above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio under this subclause (b) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent date);
plus

(c) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on
the date of determination, after giving pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed
5.90 to 1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (a) above on the date of
determination of the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio not being included in the
calculation of Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (c) on such date of
determination but not, for the avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made
on any such subsequent date),

_provided that (i) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any_
time if such refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of determination
for such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being
refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest
and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing)
and (ii) the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued
pursuant to clauses (1)(b) and (1)(c) shall not cause the Non Guarantor Debt Cap to be
exceeded;

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or
other obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of
a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) Indebtedness, and any Guarantees thereof, in each case of the
Company the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal, outstanding on the Completion Date (or
Incurred under a facility committed and as in effect as of the Completion Date), after giving pro
_forma effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom (as described_
under ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ in this Offering Memorandum), (b)(i) the Senior Secured Notes (other
than any Additional Senior Secured Notes), including any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee,
(ii) the Senior Notes (other than any Additional Senior Notes as defined under ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Notes’’), including any Senior Notes Guarantees and (iii) any loans pursuant to which_
proceeds of any Indebtedness of a Parent Entity that are lent to the Company, to the extent that
such Indebtedness is Guaranteed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise
considered Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and such Guarantees or
the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, as the case may be, as are not prohibited by the Indenture,
(c) Refinancing Indebtedness (including with respect to the Senior Secured Notes and any
Guarantee thereof) Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) and
clause (5)(b) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and
(d) other Indebtedness Incurred to finance Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an
acquisition (including an acquisition of any assets) or other transaction or (y) of Persons that are,
or secured by any assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or
merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in

187


-----

accordance with the terms of the Indenture; provided that (A) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
this clause (5) is in an aggregate amount not to exceed (a) the greater of (i) $50.0 million and
(ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, plus (b) unlimited additional Indebtedness
to the extent that after giving effect to such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation or
consolidation and without giving effect to any Indebtedness Incurred or issued pursuant to
subclause (5)(A)(a) above on the date of determination, either: (i) the Company would be
permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than
one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to
time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any manner that
complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the
second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be
permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be
permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this
covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to clauses (5)(a), (7), (11), (13) or (18) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at
any time that the Company would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(b) or

Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(b) or
clause (1)(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant, as applicable;

(3) all Indebtedness under the ABL Facility Incurred as of the Completion Date shall be deemed to
have been Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the
Company shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness;

(4) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to ‘‘cash
sweep’’ or ‘‘clean down’’ provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide
that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of
this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on
the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(5) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(6) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any clause

Indebtedness shall not be included;

(8) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments
under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or
commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens,’’ the
Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of
calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1)
through (18) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder
(and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder)
will, at the Company’s option, either (a) be determined (i) on the date of such revolving credit
facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof (or,
at the option of the Company, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) or other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, pursuant to any letter,
agreement or instrument, which may be conditional, including as to documentation) and/or
(ii) on the date on which such facility or commitments become available, and, if such Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is
satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted
under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or

191


-----

other provision of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or
creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount
permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and
bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the ‘‘Reserved
_Indebtedness Amount’’ as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the_
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio,
as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the preceding
paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be
determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased
commitment, and in each case, the Company may revoke such determination at any time and
from time to time;

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time
of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing,
such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs
and fees in connection with such refinancing; and

(11) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified
Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in
IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described
under this _‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness’’;_ _provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in_
respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Company’s sole discretion) be increased by the
amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or
additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed to
be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. Dollar
equivalent); provided that for the purpose of the Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Company may
elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness; provided,
_further, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign_
currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal

192


-----

amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness
being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid
interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
clauses (1) through (22) above, and/or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or
constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Company will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances
existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The fair
market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of any

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,
Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted
Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the ‘‘Initial Lien’’),
except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or
(2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees and the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in
the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien
for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes
Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

200


-----

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees
and the Indenture under clause (a)(2) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it
relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the relevant Security Documents.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in
the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate
of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior_
to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the ABL Facility),
(b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c) any other
agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in
connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as
consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the

Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined

the Successor Company;

asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or the assignment or
transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted
under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer or
encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges, charges or other
security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase, sale or
other agreement to which the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is a party
entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; provided that
such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets of the Company

arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to any other asset or
property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets or property of another
Restricted Subsidiary; or

restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and
other similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Company, are necessary or advisable to effect
such Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to any
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of
the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ if the encumbrances and

202


-----

restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially
less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and restrictions
contained in (A) the agreements, documents and instruments entered into in connection with, or
pursuant to, the ABL Facility, together with the security documents associated therewith, and
(B) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Completion Date or (ii) as is
customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and where, in
the case of this sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Company determines at the time of entry into such
agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any
material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior
Secured Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a
default relating to such agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

_Liens’’; or_

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (an ‘‘Initial Agreement’’) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (15); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders (taken as a whole) than
the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined
in good faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be
determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in
good faith by the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap or relates to Non-Core Assets), with a purchase
price in excess of the greater of (a) $35.0 million and (b) 7.5% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of
the consideration from such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other
Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash
Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary),
within 450 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash, (A) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Senior Secured
Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, including Indebtedness under any

203

Credit Facility (including the ABL Facility) (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof) or (B) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured by
Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary) _provided,_ _however, that, in connection with any prepayment,_
repayment, purchase or redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be reduced (including by a reduction in borrowing base or
similar term in conjunction with such Asset Sale or otherwise) in an amount equal to the
principal amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; _provided further that to the_
extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase
any amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has extended
such offer to the Holders on at least a pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in respect of
such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including any Holders) elect not to tender their Senior
Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption, the
Company will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to such
amount not tendered under this paragraph (a), and such amount shall not increase the
amount of Excess Proceeds; or

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company
or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 450 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding
agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of
such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available
Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an
‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled
or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash
shall constitute Excess Proceeds,

_provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with clause (a) or (b) above, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available
Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the
extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including
financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant
directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a
Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this
covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as reasonably determined by the Company in
its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in
compliance with this covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Indenture; provided that, if at the time of any definitive agreement,
put option or similar arrangement in respect of any Asset Disposition or (at the option of the Company)
the date on which Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition is received, the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is no greater than 4.90 to 1.00, 50.0% of

204


-----

the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition shall be deemed not to constitute Excess Proceeds and
may be used by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purpose not prohibited by the
Indenture. On the 451st day (or such longer period permitted by clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of $120.0 million and 25.0% of LTM
EBITDA, the Company will be required to make an offer (‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) within 10 Business
Days to all Holders under the Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition
Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than 100% of
the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness), in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as
applicable, and with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of A100,000 (with
respect to the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or $200,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes)
and in integral multiples of A1,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or $1,000 (with respect
to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) in excess thereof. The Company will deliver notice of such Asset
Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each
Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for
the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days
and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by
the Indenture and described in such notice. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with
respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with
respect to all Net Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period as
provided above) or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any
purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by
holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the
Excess Proceeds among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or
purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Secured
Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; _provided that the Company shall not be required to select and_
purchase Senior Secured Notes or other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars or Euros, the amount thereof payable in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in U.S. Dollars or Euros that is actually
received by the Company upon converting such portion into U.S. Dollars or Euros.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on
such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

205


-----

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from
the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant during the same fiscal
year, not to exceed the greater of (a) $120.0 million and (b) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the
fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the
time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in
the Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture
relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result
of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.

The agreements, documents and instruments entered into in connection with, or pursuant to, the ABL
Facility may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company
becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes, the
Company could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Senior Secured Notes or could
attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such
consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Secured Notes
under such instruments.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related
transactions being an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(i) $50.0 million and (ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in
a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
and

206


-----

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(a) $70.0 million and (b) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have
been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2)
above if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the
Company, if any.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’ or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of,

compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term
incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits

such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation is otherwise permitted under the Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or

indirectly and including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers,
contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or
for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as
these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed
or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the
extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

(7) any transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified Securitization
Financing or Receivables Facility, any disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets,
Receivables Assets or related assets in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or
Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors or

management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity which
would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any
Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or
similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of such Person is also a director of the
Company or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company (provided, _however, that such_
director abstains from voting as a director of the Company or such direct or indirect Parent Entity
of the Company, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

capital of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (b) amendment, waiver or other
transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other

the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the
requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

-----

obligations under the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including the Transaction
Agreement, any registration rights agreement or purchase agreements related thereto) to which it

_provided,_ _however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted_
Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or

clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise

faith by the Company;

Company’s Affiliates;

connection with similar transactions;

209


-----

‘‘—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries’’ and pledges of Capital Stock of
Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(26) any Permitted Tax Restructuring.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a
Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market
value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the
time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more clauses of the
definition of ‘‘Permitted Investment’’, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be
permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under
the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Company will be in default of such
covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation will be deemed
to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted
under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (including pursuant to clause (5) of
the second paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause),
calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing
Period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence immediately following such
designation. Any such designation by the Company or the re-designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to a
Restricted Subsidiary as contemplated hereby shall be evidenced to the Trustee on the date of such
designation or re-designation by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation or re-designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the
following reports following the Issue Date:

information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided
that such _pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iv) a brief description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, 90 days) following
the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, beginning
with the first such fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, quarterly year-to-date financial

unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date

(ii) unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company,_
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations (other than the Combination) that have occurred since the beginning of the

of such event.

211


-----

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request
of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons
who are not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made
under any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Indenture)
shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect, including, to the extent adopted at such time, the
application of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and IFRS 16 (Leases) and any successor
standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under GAAP), on the date of such report or financial
statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods
presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on
a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the
reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity
or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20.0% of the Company’s LTM EBITDA
(calculated (i) in the case of an acquisition, including any _pro forma adjustments in respect of such_
acquisition and (ii) in the case of a disposal, excluding any _pro forma adjustments in respect of such_
disposal) for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the Annual Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Statements will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports
which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and
other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the
equity securities of the Company or any Parent Entity (into which the financial results of the Company are
consolidated) or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more
of the equivalent regulated markets of Euronext, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Stockholm Stock
Exchange, Euronext Dublin, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Swiss Stock Exchange, the New York
Stock Exchange or NASDAQ) (each a ‘‘Regulated Market’’) and the Company or such Parent Entity or IPO
Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to Issuer of equity securities
admitted to trading on a Regulated Market, for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the

212


-----

Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company or such Parent
Entity or such IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with the applicable Regulated Market pursuant
to such admission and disclosure standards. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and
_provided that such requirements require the Company or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and_
file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the applicable Regulated Market, the
Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity (into which
the financial results of the Company are consolidated) so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or
quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant
as if references to the Company therein were references to such Parent Entity and (b) are accompanied by
condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Entity;
(ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of any
applicable Parent Entity that are not the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis;
(iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts, none of which shall be required to
be audited. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, only
Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be taken into account when making any
calculations required under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Company may comply with the requirements of clause (2) of
the first paragraph of this covenant with respect to periods ending prior to the Completion Date by
providing the revenue and EBITDA of each of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal for such period
ended together with management’s commentary thereon in a level of detail consistent with that provided in
‘‘Summary—Recent Developments and Trading’’ in this Offering Memorandum or (y) for purposes of this
covenant, the Company shall (i) be permitted to provide unaudited financial information of the Ardagh
Carve-out Business and Exal (on a consolidated, standalone, combined, pro forma or other basis) to satisfy
any requirement to provide financial information for periods (whether full, partial or comparative periods)
commencing prior to, or that include, the Completion Date, _provided that, for any applicable quarterly_
period, the Company shall provide quarterly financial statements for Exal to the extent such statements are
otherwise prepared and provided to creditors, (ii) be permitted for such periods to provide financial
information in the same format as the financial statements of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal, as
the case may be and (iii) not be required to provide any footnotes with respect to any such financial
information.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or
negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest
with respect to the Collateral or the Escrow Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below,
that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially
impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent or the ABL Security Agent, for the benefit of the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security
Documents, the Escrow Charge and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement as the case may be, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral or the Escrow Collateral,
_except that (i) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate,_
supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of Incurring
Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew,
restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of

213

undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released in accordance
with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to
cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect
Holders in any material respect; _provided,_ _however, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and (v) above, the_
Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or
otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Company delivers to
the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an
Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the

the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified or
replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in
equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such

covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications)
consent to any amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or other modification or
replacement requested in accordance with this covenant without the need for instructions from any
Holder.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Facility, any
other Credit Facility or any Public Debt (including the Senior Notes), in each case of the Issuer or a
Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the
Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, which Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee will be senior to or _pari passu in right of payment with, as applicable, such Restricted_
Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall
not be obligated to become a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in:
(1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability
for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership,
directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or
obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the
option of the Company, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor
liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

214


-----

Future Senior Secured Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set
forth under ‘‘Senior Secured Notes Guarantees—Senior Secured Notes Guarantee Release.’’ The Trustee and
the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at
the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in accordance
with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and
the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ‘‘Risk Factors’’—
_Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and_
_other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the Security Interests.’’_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence by
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of (x) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as otherwise
required herein and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the
foregoing clause (x), the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an
intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole)), including
substantially the same terms with respect to release of Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and priority and
release of the Security Interests; provided that (1) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose
any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security
Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Trustee
or Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Intercreditor
Agreement and (2) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any time, the
correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of
Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types
of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking
junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the obligations
under the ABL Facility or Senior Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior Secured Notes),
(5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured
Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, (8) make any other change to
any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect
or (9) make all necessary provisions to ensure that the Senior Secured Notes are secured by the relevant
Liens over the Collateral. The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to
enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without
the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers,’’ and the Company
may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such
amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion

215


-----

of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or
immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that
such transaction would comply with the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be
deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to
the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Financial Calculations_**

In the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (w) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an
acquisition (including an acquisition of assets) or other transaction or (x) assumes Indebtedness of Persons
that are, or secured by assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged
into, amalgamated or consolidated with, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture or (y) commits to an acquisition or transaction pursuant to which it may Incur
Acquired Indebtedness or (z) is subject to a Change of Control, the date of determination of LTM
EBITDA, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Company, be (a) the date
that a definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement for such acquisition, transaction, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or Change of Control is entered into and the LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving _pro forma effect to such acquisition, Change of_
Control and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definitions of ‘‘LTM EBITDA’’, ‘‘Fixed
_Charge Coverage Ratio’’ and ‘‘pro forma’’, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such_
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant acquisition or Change of Control, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result
of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition and any related
transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation
of such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation or consolidation; _provided that if the Company_
elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, put option or
similar arrangement, (i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive
agreement, put option or similar arrangement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes
of calculating any ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the
date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without
consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any
covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such
acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition,
but any calculation of LTM EBITDA or Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of
Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect
such acquisition until it has been consummated unless such other Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens is

216


-----

conditional or contingent on the occurrence of such acquisition or Change of Control or (b) the date such
Indebtedness is borrowed or assumed or such Change of Control occurs;

**Merger and Consolidation**

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be (x) a Person
organized and existing under the laws of England and Wales. Germany, any member state of the
European Union or the European Economic Area, or the United States of America, any State of
the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or
Switzerland or Australia or Bermuda and (y) the Successor Company (if not the Company) will
expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Company under the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture and all
obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred and is
continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Company or the applicable
Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant
to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness’’ or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted_
Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) any Guarantor (other than the Company), unless it is the other party to the transactions
described above, will have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Senior Secured Note
Guarantee will apply to such Person’s obligations under the Indenture and the Senior Secured
Notes;

(5) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Company)
comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (in the case of a Successor Company) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely
on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1),
(2) and (3) above; and

(6) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or substantially
equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any limitations required in
accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods) guarantees and security (if
any) over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or other interests) in
the Company or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or shares (or other
interests) cease to exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the Company cease to
exist, security will be granted (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) over the shares (or other
interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Company under the Senior Secured Notes and the Indenture.

217


-----

The provisions set forth in this ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Guarantor other than the Company from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or
part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor other than the Company; or (ii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor other than the Company; provided that (A) if the
Issuer is not the surviving entities of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the
obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transactions will be permitted without compliance with this section.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note when due and payable, continued
for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured
Note when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase,
upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture,
other than those set out in clauses (1) or (2) above;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there
may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed which is Incurred or Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, other
than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a ‘‘payment
_default’’); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the ‘‘cross
_acceleration provision’’),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default
of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the
maturity of which has been accelerated, is in excess of the greater of (x) $140.0 million and
(y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company, the Issuer or a
Significant Subsidiary (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(6) failure by the Company, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating
in excess of the greater of (x) $140.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, other than any
judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and
creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a
period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding

218


-----

paragraph) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by
insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment
or decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default provision’’);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents or the Escrow Charge having a fair market
value in excess of the greater of (x) $70.0 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA shall, at any
time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant
Security Document, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any reason other than the
satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such Security
Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or the Escrow Charge or any
such Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is
invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days;

(8) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee of one or more Guarantors that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary (a
‘‘Significant Guarantor’’) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or
ceases for any reason to be in full force and effect, or is denied or disaffirmed by such Significant
Guarantor or any Person acting on behalf of it; and

(9) failure by the Issuer to consummate a Special Mandatory Redemption on the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date as described above under ‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption.’’_

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the above paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the
Company does not cure such Default within 60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee
may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable
immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of
Default described in clause (4) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect
thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is
continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Secured Notes will
become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the
Trustee or any Holders.

219


-----

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the
Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the
Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment
of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Secured Note held by a
non-consenting Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration
with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except
to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not
given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such
request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own
affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or
that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to

220


-----

indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in
writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if
and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their
status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or
compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes). However,
without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the
then outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior
Secured Note (other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Secured Note (other
than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Secured Note or change
the time at which any such Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described
above under ‘‘Optional Redemption’’ or ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’;

(4) make any such Senior Secured Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior
Secured Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal
of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after
the due dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under ‘‘Withholding Taxes’’ that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any material respect or
amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an
exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to
withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay
Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral (taken as a whole) or the Escrow Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of
the Security Documents, the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the Intercreditor

221


-----

Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; provided that,
for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the covenant described under the heading
‘‘Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest,’’ the release of less than all or substantially
all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole)
shall only require the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions,
any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer
for, Senior Secured Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the
Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior
Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or
the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose holders must consent to any
amendment, waiver or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver
provisions which require the Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders
to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) any amendment, waiver or other modification affects the rights
of the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes and the rights of the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes,
the consent of a majority of 90% or 75%, as the case may be, in aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes shall be required to consent thereto and (b) any amendment, waiver or other modification
affects only the rights of the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes or only the rights of the Senior Secured
Euro Floating Rate Notes, the consent of a majority or 90% or 75%, as the case may be, in aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes or Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes, as
applicable, shall be required to consent thereto (and in such case, the consent of a majority of 90% or 75%,
as the case may be, in aggregate principal amount of the unaffected series of Senior Secured notes shall
not be required to consent thereto).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Issuer, the
Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor
under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
make any change (including changing the ISIN, CUSIP or other identifying number on any
Senior Secured Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in
any material respect;

222


-----

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured
Notes that may be issued in compliance with the Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ or ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Additional Guarantees,’’ to add Senior Secured Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior_
Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm
and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release,
termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents,
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this
‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes’’ was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the_
Indenture, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee

effect on the Completion Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security
Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such
Security Interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest’’ is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Senior Secured Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and
administration of Senior Secured Notes; _provided,_ _however, that (i) compliance with the_
Indenture as so amended would not result in Senior Secured Notes being transferred in violation
of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not
adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer Senior Secured Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with (a) the definition of ‘‘Permitted Reorganization’’ or
(b) the covenants described under the headings ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ and ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ relating to mergers,_

(12) as provided in ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’; or

(13) to amend, supplement or otherwise modify the Escrow Agreement or the Escrow Charge in ways
that would not be adverse to the Holders of Senior Secured Notes in any material respect.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, as applicable) shall
be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Senior Secured Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the

223


-----

substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any
Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered
invalid by such tender. The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a
consent fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the
Senior Secured Notes Documents (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of
Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers,
trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registrations of Senior
Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office
or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer
exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders
under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will
terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (1), (2) and (5) of the first paragraph
of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’) and ‘‘Change of Control’’ and the default provisions relating to such
covenants described under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment
default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer),
the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provisions described
under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding their
prior exercise of their covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option,
payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event
of Default specified in clause (3) (other than clauses (1), (2) and (5) of the first paragraph of ‘‘Merger and
_Consolidation’’), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of_
Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for
the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Issuer), (6),
(7) or (8) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
‘‘defeasance trust’’) with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof (in the case of the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or cash in U.S. Dollars, U.S. Government
Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of Senior Secured Dollar Notes), for the payment of
principal, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case
may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that
beneficial owners of Senior Secured Notes, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Senior
Secured Notes);

224


-----

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of
further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes and rights
of the Trustee, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Senior Secured Notes of a series issued
thereunder when (1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes of that series previously authenticated and
delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes and certain Senior Secured
Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to
the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes of that
series not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will
become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption
within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by
the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee, money in Euros or European Government Obligations, or a combination
thereof (in the case of Senior Secured Euro Notes) or money in U.S. Dollars, U.S. Government
Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of Senior Secured Dollar Notes), as applicable, in an
amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes of that series
not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the
date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other
sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee
under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Senior Secured Notes of that
series at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under
the ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as
to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in
writing by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to Stated
Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; _provided,_ _however, that the Holders shall have_
received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such earlier repayment date (which may be
included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to
Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest,
present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.
Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view
of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

225


-----

**Concerning the Trustee**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in
such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture
will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest
that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then
the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than
6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if
and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes will be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any
Senior Secured Notes are represented by global Senior Secured Notes, all notices to Holders will be
delivered to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and/or DTC, as applicable, which will give such notices to
the Holders of book-entry interests in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream and/or DTC, as applicable, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
this paragraph.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to
such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so
mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in
it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given in via DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, it is duly given on the day the notice is
given to DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream.

226


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable
due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on
the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Restrictions**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in U.S. Dollars, with respect to the Senior
Secured Dollar Notes, and Euros, with respect to the Senior Secured Euro Notes (each a ‘‘Required
_Currency’’) which is made to or for the account of any Holder or the Trustee in lawful currency of any other_
jurisdiction (the ‘‘Other Currency’’) whether as a result of any judgment or order or the enforcement
thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of any of the Issuer, Company or any other
Guarantor shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer’s, Company’s or such Guarantor’s obligation under the
Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, only to
the extent of the amount of the Required Currency which such Holder or the Trustee could purchase in the
New York foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Other Currency in accordance with normal
banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first day (other than a Saturday or Sunday)
on which banks in New York, are generally open for business following receipt of the payment first
referred to above. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased is less than the
amount of the Required Currency originally due to such Holder or the Trustee, the Issuer, Company or
such other Guarantor, as the case may be, shall indemnify and save harmless such Holder or the Trustee, as
applicable from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This
indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in
the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Note Guarantees, shall give rise to a
separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Trustee
or any Holder of a Senior Secured Note from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding any judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or
under any judgment or order.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction herein, the U.S. Dollar equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-U.S. Dollar currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non-U.S. Dollar amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on Euronext Dublin and for permission to
be granted to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Senior Secured Notes on Euronext Dublin will be approved or that permission to
deal in the Senior Secured Notes thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is
not conditioned on obtaining this listing or permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be
collectable within the United States.

227

the Senior Secured Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of
New York, in the United States of America. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor
will appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture,
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New
York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, and
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereunder and the Intercreditor Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the
governing law of the Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes may be amended with the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured
Notes). The Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder

Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such period shall have made any
Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or discontinued
operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed Charge

acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or discontinued operation had
occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing Period.

For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to a transaction, the pro forma

Option (as applicable), interest on a lease (including any Capitalized Lease Obligations) shall be deemed
to accrue at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such lease in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of making
the computation referred to above, interest on any Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility computed
with a pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during
the Relevant Testing Period except to the extent such revolving credit facility has been permanently repaid
and the commitments thereunder cancelled. Interest on Indebtedness that may optionally be determined
at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered rate, or

such guaranteeing Person may be liable pursuant to the terms of the instrument embodying such
Guarantee or, if such Guarantee is not an unconditional guarantee of the entire amount of the primary

_again, that the Company may only make such election if it also elects to report any subsequent financial_

more than one element (including for the calculation of a financial ratio), such selected accounting
standard shall be consistently applied to each element of such determination or calculation (other than, for
the avoidance of doubt, in relation to the covenant described under the caption ‘‘Reports’’); and (ii) any
adverse impact directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue

Finance B.V. (the ‘‘Issuer’’), a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands. You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this ‘‘Description of the Senior
_Notes’’ under the heading ‘‘Certain Definitions’’ below. For purposes of this ‘‘Description of the Senior_
_Notes,’’ references to the ‘‘Issuer,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘our,’’ and ‘‘us’’ refer only to Trivium Packaging Finance B.V. and_
not to any of its Subsidiaries. The term the ‘‘Company’’ refers to Trivium Packaging B.V.

The Issuer will issue the Senior Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about the Issue Date (the
‘‘Indenture’’), between, _inter alios, the Issuer, the Company as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., London_
Branch as trustee (in such capacity, the ‘‘Trustee’’) and paying agent, in a private transaction that is not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under,
incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act,
including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections
provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture,
including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of
interest and to inform the Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement and release of the Escrowed
Property from the Escrow Account (each as defined below), the proceeds from the offering of the Senior
Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together with the proceeds from the offering of the
Senior Secured Notes, to fund the cash portion of the consideration payable for the Combination and pay
the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions (as defined in this Offering
Memorandum), including estimated fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering of the
Senior Notes, as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the captions ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’ and ‘‘The
_Transactions.’’_

Pending the satisfaction of certain other conditions as described under the caption ‘‘Escrow of
_Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,’’ the Initial Purchasers (as defined in this Offering_
Memorandum) will, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date,
deposit the gross proceeds of the Senior Notes sold on the Issue Date into a U.S. Dollar-denominated
escrow account (the ‘‘Escrow Account’’) pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the ‘‘Escrow
_Agreement’’) dated as of the Issue Date, among the Company, the Trustee and Citibank, N.A., London_
Branch as the escrow agent (the ‘‘Escrow Agent’’). If the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Property
(as defined below), as more fully described below under the caption ‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special
_Mandatory Redemption,’’ have not been satisfied on the Business Day following April 14, 2020 (the ‘‘Escrow_
_Longstop Date’’), or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Senior Notes will be redeemed at a_
price equal to 100% of the issue price of the Senior Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue
Date to, but excluding, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) and Additional
Amounts, if any. See ‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will only be
obligations of the Company and the Issuer and will not be guaranteed by the Ardagh Carve-out Business
or Exal or any of their respective Subsidiaries. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the
occurrence of the Completion Date, Ardagh MP Holdings UK Limited, Ardagh Metal Packaging UK
Limited, Ardagh Germany MP GmbH, Ardagh Metal Packaging Germany GmbH, Ardagh MP Group
Netherlands B.V., Ardagh Metal Packaging Netherlands B.V., Ardagh Aluminium Packaging
Netherlands B.V., Ardagh Metal Packaging Hjørring A/S, Ardagh Metal Packaging Canada Limited,
Ardagh Metal Packaging Hungary Kft., Ardagh Aluminium Packing Hungary Kft, Ardagh Metal Packaging
Poland sp. z o.o., Ardagh Metal Packaging Iberica, S.A., Ardagh Metal Packaging USA Inc., Element US
Holding Company and Exal Corporation, and certain holding companies in each of Germany, Spain, Italy,
the United Kingdom and France (the ‘‘Post-Completion Date Guarantors’’) will enter into one or more

277


-----

supplemental indentures to become a party to the Indenture and guarantee the Senior Notes on a senior
basis within 90 days from the Completion Date.

Prior to the Completion Date, the Company will not be able to cause the Ardagh Carve-out Business
or Exal to comply with the covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ or other
agreements under the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the
Ardagh Carve-out Business or Exal will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited
by the Indenture had those covenants or other agreements been applicable to such entities as of the Issue
Date, and any such non-compliance will not constitute a default or Event of Default under the Indenture.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Combination—Trivium may have liabilities that we are unaware of.’’

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which $600.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of Senior Notes will be issued in this offering. We may, subject to applicable law and the
terms of the Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Notes (the ‘‘Additional
Senior Notes’’) provided that if the Additional Senior Notes are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax
purposes with the Senior Notes, such Additional Senior Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code,
and/or CUSIP from the Notes originally issued. We will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Notes
in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenants restricting the
Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of Liens. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Except as otherwise provided for in the_
Indenture, the Senior Notes, and if issued, Additional Senior Notes, will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this ‘‘Description of the
_Senior Notes,’’ references to the ‘‘Senior Notes’’ include the Senior Notes and any Additional Senior Notes_
that are actually issued under the Indenture.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness,
the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement
action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the relevant security agent. See ‘‘Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

This ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the
Senior Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Escrow Charge. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Notes is only a summary, you should refer
to the Senior Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow
Charge for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Company and your rights. Copies of such
documents will be available from us upon request on and after the Issue Date.

The registered Holder of a Senior Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Notes have not been, and will not be,
registered under the Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Senior Notes_**

The Senior Notes will:

   - be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

278


-----

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes (including the obligations under the
ABL Facility, certain Hedging Obligations);

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets of the Issuer other than the Escrow Charge
(including the obligations under the ABL Facility, the Senior Secured Notes and certain Hedging
Obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or
indebtedness;

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that are not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors;

   - be (i) guaranteed by the Company on a senior basis on the Issue Date and (ii) subject to the Agreed
Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement and the occurrence of the Completion Date,
within 90 days from the Completion Date, guaranteed by the Post-Completion Date Guarantors, in
each case, on a senior basis, as described further under ‘‘—Senior Notes Guarantees’’; and

   - be represented by one or more registered Senior Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Senior Notes (as defined below). See ‘‘Book-entry;
_Delivery and Form.’’_

The Issuer is a finance subsidiary with no business operations and has no revenue-generating
operations of its own. The Issuer will be dependent upon payments from the Company to meet its
obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Notes. The payments to the Issuer will depend on
the profitability and cash flows of the Company and its other Subsidiaries. The Senior Notes will be
structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer will be a ‘‘Restricted Subsidiary’’ for the purposes of the Indenture, and
as of the Completion Date, we expect that all subsidiaries of the Company will be Restricted Subsidiaries
for the purposes of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,’’ we will be permitted to designate_
certain of our Subsidiaries as ‘‘Unrestricted Subsidiaries.’’ Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject
to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Senior Notes.

On a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total debt of
$2,853 million (including $2,150.0 million (equivalent) in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Notes and, $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and the new ABL Facility which is
anticipated to provide for commitments of up to $250.0 million with availability subject to conditions
typical for asset based revolving credit facilities) of which $2,246 million would have been secured.

**_The Senior Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed by the Company on a senior basis. Subject to
the Agreed Security Principles and the Intercreditor Agreement and the occurrence of the Completion
Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Post-Completion Date Guarantors by
the earlier of (x) 90 days from the Completion Date, or (y) the date on which such Post-Completion Date
Guarantors guarantee the obligations under the ABL Facility. In addition, if required by the covenant
described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,’’ certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may
provide a Senior Notes Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.

279


-----

Once granted, the Senior Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

   - be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that
is not subordinated in right of payment, including obligations under the ABL Facility, the Senior
Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations;

   - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Senior Notes Guarantee of that Guarantor;

   - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Notes Guarantee;

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that Guarantor
and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Notes or the
Senior Notes Guarantees (including obligations under the obligations under the ABL Facility, the
Senior Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such indebtedness; and

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that
Guarantor that do not guarantee the Senior Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Senior Notes will mature on August 15, 2027, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein.
On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue $600 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes.

The Senior Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof.

The Senior Notes (together with any Additional Senior Notes) will be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Indenture, including without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase and any other action by the Holders hereunder, except as otherwise
provided in the Indenture.

Interest on overdue principal and interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at a rate that is 1% higher
than the interest rate on the overdue principal or interest.

**_Interest on the Senior Notes_**

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes
will be payable on December 15, 2019 and thereafter semi-annually in arrears on August 15 and
February 15. Interest on the Senior Notes will be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Notes on
the Business Day immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already
been paid, from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of DTC. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Notes is not a Business Day
at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of
the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any
further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

If the Issuer redeems any Senior Notes on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before
the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the
redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Senior Note is

280


-----

registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Senior Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

The right of holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Notes to receive the payment on such Senior
Notes will be subject to the applicable procedures of DTC.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes (as defined
below) will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being DTC or its nominee).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(‘‘Definitive Registered Senior Notes’’) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more
Paying Agents maintained for such purposes in London, United Kingdom. In addition, interest on the
Definitive Registered Senior Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by check mailed by the
Company to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders for the
Definitive Registered Senior Notes. See ‘‘Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes’’ below.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Notes. The initial Paying Agent
will be Citibank N.A, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a ‘‘Registrar’’) and one or more transfer
agent (each, the ‘‘Transfer Agent’’). The initial Registrar will be Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG for
the Senior Notes. The initial Transfer Agent will be Citibank N.A., London Branch.

The Registrar and Transfer Agent will maintain a register for the Senior Notes reflecting the
ownership of the Senior Notes outstanding from time to time, and together with the Transfer Agent will
facilitate transfers of the Senior Notes on behalf of the Issuer.

A register of the Holders shall be left at the registered office of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency
between the register of Senior Notes kept by the Registrar and the one kept by the Issuer at its registered
office, the register kept by the Registrar shall prevail.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Senior Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Senior Notes. The Issuer or any of
its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Notes.

**Senior Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

Upon the initial issuance of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed
on a senior basis by the Company. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the occurrence of the
Completion Date, the Post-Completion Date Guarantors will guarantee, jointly and severally, on a senior
basis (each (including the Guarantee of the Senior Notes by the Company), a ‘‘Senior Notes Guarantee’’
and together (including the Guarantee of the Senior Notes by the Company), the ‘‘Senior Notes
_Guarantees’’) the obligations of the Company pursuant to the Senior Notes, including any payment_
obligation resulting from a Change of Control, by the earlier of (x) 90 days from the Completion Date or
(y) the date on which such Post-Completion Date Guarantors provide guarantee the obligations under the
ABL Facility.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the occurrence of the Completion Date, the
Post-Completion Date Guarantors will be Ardagh MP Holdings UK Limited, Ardagh Metal Packaging UK
Limited, Ardagh Germany MP GmbH, Ardagh Metal Packaging Germany GmbH, Ardagh MP Group

281


-----

Netherlands B.V., Ardagh Metal Packaging Netherlands B.V., Ardagh Aluminium Packaging
Netherlands B.V., Ardagh Metal Packaging Hjørring A/S, Ardagh Metal Packaging Canada Limited,
Ardagh Metal Packaging Hungary Kft., Ardagh Aluminium Packing Hungary Kft, Ardagh Metal Packaging
Poland sp. z o.o., Ardagh Metal Packaging Iberica, S.A., Ardagh Metal Packaging USA Inc., Element US
Holding Company, Exal Corporation, and certain holding companies in each of Germany, Spain, Italy, the
United Kingdom and France (the ‘‘Post-Completion Date Guarantors’’).

The Post-Completion Date Guarantors would have accounted for 61% of the aggregate pro forma
total assets and 61% of the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of the Group as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions. Although the Indenture
will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a
number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the
Incurrence by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See ‘‘Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.’’_

In addition, as described under _‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’ and subject to the_
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Issuer that
guarantee the ABL Facility or the Senior Secured Notes in the future or any other Credit Facility or Public
Debt, in each case, of the Issuer or a Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental senior notes
indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions
on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules,
fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims
and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the
benefit accruing to the Holders. See ‘‘Description of Senior Secured Notes—Security—The Collateral.’’

Each Senior Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the
Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under
the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By
virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee could be significantly
less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Senior Notes Guarantee. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and
_the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and the_
_Security Interests and ‘‘—The insolvency laws of the Netherlands and other local insolvency laws may not be as_
_favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or those of another jurisdiction with which you are familiar.’’_

A portion of the operations of the Company will be conducted through Subsidiaries that are not
expected to become Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including
trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and
claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of
Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to
the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, including Holders. The Senior Notes and each Senior Notes Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of the
Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of Subsidiaries
of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Combination—
_Trivium may have liabilities that we are unaware of.’’ The Post-Completion Date Guarantors would have_

282


-----

accounted for 61% of the aggregate pro forma total assets and 61% of the pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of
the Group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions.

As of March 31, 2019, on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Company
would have had, on a consolidated basis, total debt of $2,853 million and total retirement benefit
obligations of $312 million.

**_Senior Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Senior Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will automatically terminate and be released:

(1) upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger, or
amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a
holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a
Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale,
exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes in
accordance with the Indenture, as provided in ‘‘Defeasance’’ and ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge,’’
respectively;

(4) upon the release of the Guarantor’s Guarantee of any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Senior Notes under the covenant described in ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’;_ _provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time_
Guaranteed by the Guarantor that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide a
Senior Notes Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under the caption ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees’’;_

(5) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(6) as described under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers’’;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; provided that the resulting, surviving or transferee
Person is or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such Permitted Reorganization;

(8) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Senior Notes; or

(9) as a result of a transaction permitted by ‘‘Merger and Consolidation.’’

The Notes Guarantee of the Company will automatically terminate and be released only upon the
circumstances described in clauses (3), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) set forth above.

The Trustee shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture,
take all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Company, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Senior Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to
customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Trustee without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of
the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Company will be required to make a notation on the Senior Notes
to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

283


-----

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Senior Note, will be deemed (without
any further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and perform the duties and exercise the
rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement,
together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (including the
execution of, and compliance with, any waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or
replacement expressed to be executed by the Trustee on its behalf).

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.’’_

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

Concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will
enter into the Escrow Agreement with, inter alios, the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the
Initial Purchasers will deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to the gross proceeds of the Senior
Notes sold on the Issue Date into the Escrow Account. The Escrow Account will be pledged on a firstpriority basis in favor of the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Senior Notes pursuant to an
escrow charge dated the Issue Date between the Issuer and the Trustee (the ‘‘Escrow Charge’’). The initial
funds deposited in the Escrow Account, and all other funds, securities, interest, dividends, distributions
and other property and payments credited to the Escrow Account (less any property and/or funds paid in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the ‘‘Escrowed Property.’’

On the Business Day prior to an interest payment date, the Escrow Agent shall release to the Paying
Agent from the respective Escrow Account an amount necessary to fund the respective interest payment.

Except in the circumstances described in the proceeding paragraph, in order to cause the Escrow
Agent to release the Escrowed Property to the Issuer (the ‘‘Closing Escrow Release’’), the Escrow Agent
and the Trustee shall have received from the Company on or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date, an
Officer’s Certificate, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall be able to rely conclusively
without further investigation, to the effect that all of the following conditions have been met or will be
satisfied on or prior to the Business Day immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date:

  - the Escrowed Property will be applied in substantially the same manner as described in this
Offering Memorandum;

  - the Combination will be consummated, or has already been consummated, on the terms set forth in
the Transaction Agreement (and on substantially the same terms as described in this Offering
Memorandum) promptly (and, in any event, no later than within three Business Days) following the
Closing Escrow Release, except for any changes, waivers or other modifications that will not,
individually or when taken as whole, have a material adverse effect on the Holders of the Senior
Notes;

   - immediately after the Combination, the Company will own, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and outstanding share capital of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal; and

284


-----

   - as of the delivery date of such Officer’s Certificate, there is no Default or Event of Default with
respect to the Issuer under clauses (5) or (9) of the first paragraph under the caption titled ‘‘Events
_of Default’’ below._

The Closing Escrow Release shall occur promptly following receipt of such Officer’s Certificate. Upon
the Closing Escrow Release, the Escrow Account shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property
shall be paid out in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the Completion Date does not take place on or prior to the Business Day
immediately following the Escrow Longstop Date, (b) the Issuer notifies the Trustee and the Escrow Agent
that in their reasonable judgment the Combination will not be completed by the Business Day immediately
following the Escrow Longstop Date, (c) the Initial Investors cease to beneficially own and control a
majority of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Company, (d) the Transaction Agreement
terminates at any time prior to the Escrow Longstop Date or (e) a Default or Event of Default arises with
respect to the Issuer under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the caption titled ‘‘Events of Default’’ on
or prior to the Escrow Longstop Date (the date of any such event being the ‘‘Special Termination Date’’),
the Issuer will redeem all of the Senior Notes (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption’’) at a price (the
‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Price’’) equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Senior Notes,
plus accrued but unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, from the Issue Date to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Written notice of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by the Issuer, no later than one
Business Day following the Special Termination Date, to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Escrow
Agent, and the Escrow Agreement and the Indenture will provide that the Senior Notes shall be redeemed
on a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Company in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the ‘‘Special Mandatory Redemption Date’’). On the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay, on behalf of the Issuer, to the Paying
Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder’s Senior
Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property (if any)
to the Issuer.

In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory
Redemption exceeds the amount of the initial funds deposited in the Escrow Account and all other funds,
securities, interest, dividends, distributions and other property and payments credited to the Escrow
Account including accrued interest and Additional Amounts (if any) due with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (such excess, the ‘‘Escrow
_Contribution Amount’’), Ardagh Group S.A. and Element Holdings II, L.P. will each be required under the_
terms of the Transaction Agreement to fund to the Issuer half of the Escrow Contribution Amount.

Receipt by the Trustee from the Company of either an Officer’s Certificate for the Escrow Release or
a notice of Special Mandatory Redemption shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee for the release
of the Escrowed Property from the Escrow Charge.

If at the time of such Special Mandatory Redemption, the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List
of the Exchange and the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority that the
Special Mandatory Redemption has occurred and any relevant details relating to such Special Mandatory
Redemption.

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,’’ the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted_

285


-----

Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

**_Senior Notes_**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons,’’ the
Senior Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Issuer.

At any time prior to, 2022 the Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes (in whole or in part, at
its option, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of such Senior Note plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time prior to, 2022 the Issuer may, at its option, redeem
Senior Notes, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ with the Net Cash Proceeds received
by the Issuer from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to % of the principal amount of
the Senior Notes so redeemed (as applicable), plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions
not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including any
Additional Senior Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including
Additional Senior Notes) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately
thereafter.

At any time and from time to time on or after, 2022 the Issuer may redeem the Senior
Notes, in whole or in part, upon notice as described under ‘‘Selection and Notice,’’ at a redemption price
equal to the percentage of principal amount of the Senior Notes so redeemed (as applicable) set forth
below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the
applicable redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any, if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on, of the year indicated below:

**Senior Euro Floating**

**_Other Redemption Terms_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for the Senior Notes, including a
Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Senior Notes validly tender
and do not withdraw such Senior Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such
a tender offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by
such Holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Senior
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following such purchase at a price equal to the
price offered to each other Holder (excluding any early tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus,
to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date.

286


-----

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
we may repurchase the Senior Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under ‘‘Selection and Notice’’ below.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

Other than in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer is not required to make
mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Senior Notes. However,
under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase Senior Notes as described
under ‘‘Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.’’

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC will credit its participants’
accounts on a pro rata pass-through distribution of principal basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions),
or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including by pool factor); provided, however, that
no book-entry interest of less than $200,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Senior
Notes are not held through DTC or DTC prescribes no method of selection, the Senior Notes will be
selected, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Senior Note in an unauthorized
denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; _provided,_ _however, that no Senior Note of_
$200,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Notes in integral
multiples of $1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be liable
for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but
not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Senior Notes to be redeemed at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices may be delivered electronically or mailed more than
60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior
Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Senior Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the Issuer’s
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a
related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice of redemption shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that,
in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but not more than 60 days
after the date the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such
redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.
In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance
of the Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

287


-----

If and for so long as any Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any such notice to the
Holders of the Senior Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of
any change in the principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding.

If any Definitive Registered Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that
relates to that Definitive Registered Senior Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to
be redeemed, in which case a portion of the original Definitive Registered Senior Note will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Senior Note. In the
case of a global Senior Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of
the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein), Senior Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the
Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Notes or
portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a ‘‘Tax Redemption Date’’) (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under ‘‘Withholding Taxes,’’ if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation which is announced and
becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, where such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction becomes a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at a later date, after such later date); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, the official application, administration or written interpretation
of such laws, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) which is announced
and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, where such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction becomes
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at a later date, after such later date) (each of the foregoing in
clauses (1) and (2), a ‘‘Change in Tax Law’’),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Senior Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Senior Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only
if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor who can
make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot be
avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). The foregoing provisions shall apply
(a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the
Senior Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a
party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures
described under ‘‘Selection and Notice.’’ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will
be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make
such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, the obligation to pay

288


-----

Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of
Senior Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate
stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) a
written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a ‘‘Payor’’) in respect of the Senior Notes or with respect to any Senior Notes Guarantee, as
applicable, will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any
Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing
authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Note or Senior Notes
Guarantee is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax purposes,
or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax
(each of clause (1) and (2), a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with
respect to any Senior Note or any Senior Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption
price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional
amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each
Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding
or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have
been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Senior Note or Senior Notes
Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided, however, that no such Additional_
Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any
present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder,
if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership,
holding or disposition of such Senior Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or
enforcement of rights under such Senior Note, the Indenture or a Senior Notes Guarantee);

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder
or the beneficial owner of the Senior Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days
before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the
Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty,

289


-----

regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Note
for payment (where Senior Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Senior Notes and
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the
date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent
that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Note been
presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with
respect to the Senior Notes or with respect to any Senior Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), as of the Issue Date (and any
amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous
to comply with), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder, or other official
administrative interpretations thereof and any agreements entered into pursuant to current
section 1471(b) of the Code, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version
described above), and including (for the avoidance of doubt) any intergovernmental agreement
(and any law, regulation or practice implementing any such intergovernmental agreement) in
respect of the foregoing; or

(7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial
owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or
beneficial owner held such Senior Notes directly.

In addition, the Payor will pay, and reimburse each applicable Holder for, any present or future stamp,
issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest,
penalties or other similar liabilities with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or
similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto)
that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from (i) the execution, issuance, delivery or registration of the
Senior Notes, any Senior Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto, or (ii) the receipt of any payments under or with respect to, or enforcement of, the Senior Notes
or any Senior Notes Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any such taxes attributable to the receipt of
payments, to any such taxes that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3), (5), or (6) above).

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or
deduction, (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with
applicable law and, (iii) upon written request, provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the
payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes,
or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as
soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made
available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying
Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior
Note or any Senior Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will

290


-----

deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary
to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless
such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in
which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive
proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Senior Notes or this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ there is
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior
Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Notes or any Senior Notes
Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or
through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Notes (or any Senior Notes Guarantee) is
made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or
therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change
of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith
delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Notes as described under
‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Notes (equal to
$200,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof; _provided that Senior_
Notes of $200,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to
the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but
excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver
or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the
address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice,
which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a
conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations
described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the

291


-----

SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender
offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Senior Notes in
the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under
the ABL Facility that permits the ABL Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings
thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on
certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased
upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to
repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control
itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer.

The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be
limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Notes
may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations
between the initial purchasers of the Senior Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding
at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur
additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation
_on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be_
waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not
contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged
transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if
(i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made
by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of
Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes has been given pursuant to the
Indenture as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of
the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the
failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control.

The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to
whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of
Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the
Senior Notes as described above.

292


-----

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of
Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants below.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that:

(a) the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and
the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the
following headings (collectively, the ‘‘Suspended Covenants’’):

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions’’;

   - ‘‘—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’;

  - ‘‘—Additional Guarantees’’; and

   - the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’.

If at any time the Senior Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended
Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the ‘‘Reversion
_Date’’) and will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with_
performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless
and until the Senior Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended
Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Notes maintain an Investment Grade
Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist
under the Senior Notes Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the
Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended
Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at
any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether
such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in
effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the
Reversion Date is referred to as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any
Indebtedness Incurred under the ABL Facility) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date
so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.’’ On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be_

293


-----

considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the
Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted_
_Payments’’ had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period._
Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available
to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ On the Reversion Date,
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the
Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second
paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in the first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on
_Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during the Suspension_
Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under
clause (1) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
_Subsidiaries.’’ On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be_
permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the
Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during
such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such
further obligation to grant Senior Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade
Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Notes, shall not be deemed to have
any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders of the Senior
Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall
notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification
shall not be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue Disqualified Stock and

paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to
time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any manner that
complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above or one of the clauses of the
second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be
permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be

covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to clauses (5)(a), (7), (11), (13) or (18) of the second paragraph of this covenant, if at
any time that the Company would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(b) or

Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clause (1)(b) or

(3) all Indebtedness under the ABL Facility Incurred as of the Completion Date shall be deemed to
have been Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(a) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and the
Company shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of such Indebtedness;

(4) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to ‘‘cash
sweep’’ or ‘‘clean down’’ provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide
that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the purposes of
this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on
the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(5) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments
under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or
commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of ‘‘Permitted Liens,’’ the
Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of
calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or
the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (18) of
the preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings thereunder (and including
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the
Company’s option, either (a) be determined (i) on the date of such revolving credit facility or
such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof (or, at the
option of the Company, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of such date) or other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, pursuant to any letter,
agreement or instrument, which may be conditional, including as to documentation) and/or
(ii) on the date on which such facility or commitments become available, and, if such Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Indenture is satisfied with
respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and
creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this
covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision

299


-----

of the Indenture at the time of any borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters
of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed
or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a
date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the ‘‘Reserved Indebtedness Amount’’ as
of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Secured Net
Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of
the usage of clauses (1) through (18) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be
Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is
borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Company
may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time;

(10) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time
of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be
exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing,
such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the
principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs
and fees in connection with such refinancing; and

(11) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified
Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in
IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described
under this _‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness’’;_ _provided that the amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness in_
respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Company’s sole discretion) be increased by the
amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value, original issue discount and/or
additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such increased amount will not be deemed to
be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such
Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
‘‘Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower U.S. Dollar
equivalent); provided that for the purpose of the Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Company may
elect to account for any such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness; provided,
_further, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign_
currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such
U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness

-----

being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid
interest, premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue
discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Guarantees and the Indenture
under clause (a)(2) in the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set
forth under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or
under the relevant security document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The ‘‘Increased Amount’’ of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in
the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate
of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

The Issuer will not incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any
Indebtedness that is or purports by its terms (or by the terms of any agreement governing such

unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes on
substantially identical terms.

The Company will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, and no Guarantor will, incur, create,
issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any Indebtedness that is or purports by its terms
(or by the terms of any agreement governing such Indebtedness) to be contractually subordinated in right
of payment to Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor and senior in right of payment to such Guarantor’s
Senior Note Guarantee. No such Indebtedness will be considered to be contractually subordinated in right
of payment to any Senior Indebtedness of any Guarantor by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering
provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to:

Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the ABL Facility),

referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (an ‘‘Initial Agreement’’) or
contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (15); provided, however, that the encumbrances
and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders (taken as a whole) than
the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to
which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined
in good faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be
determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in

311


-----

good faith by the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap or relates to Non-Core Assets), with a purchase
price in excess of the greater of (a) $35.0 million and (b) 7.5% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75% of
the consideration from such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any other
Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash
Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary),
within 450 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) the receipt of
such Net Available Cash, (A) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary secured by a Lien or (B) prepay, repay, purchase or
redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor;
_provided,_ _however, that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment, purchase or_
redemption of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any) to be
reduced (including by a reduction in borrowing base or similar term in conjunction with such
Asset Sale or otherwise) in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid,
purchased or redeemed or (C) to repay, prepay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu
Indebtedness or (D) to redeem or purchase Senior Notes; or

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received by the Company
or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 450 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset
Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however, that a binding
agreement shall be treated as a permitted application of Net Available Cash from the date of
such commitment with the good faith expectation that an amount equal to Net Available
Cash will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an
‘‘Acceptable Commitment’’) and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled
or terminated for any reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash
shall constitute Excess Proceeds,

_provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with clause (a) or (b) above, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available
Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the
extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law (including
financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of the relevant
directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition by a
Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary to comply with this
covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as reasonably determined by the Company in
its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in
compliance with this covenant.

312


-----

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed to
constitute ‘‘Excess Proceeds’’ under the Indenture; provided that, if at the time of any definitive agreement,
put option or similar arrangement in respect of any Asset Disposition or (at the option of the Company)
the date on which Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition is received, the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is no greater than 4.90 to 1.00, 50.0% of
the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition shall be deemed not to constitute Excess Proceeds and
may be used by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for any purpose not prohibited by the
Indenture. On the 451st day (or such longer period permitted by clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this
covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds the greater of $120.0 million and 25.0% of LTM
EBITDA, the Company will be required to make an offer (‘‘Asset Disposition Offer’’) within 10 Business
Days to all Holders under the Indenture and, to the extent the Company elects, to all holders of other
outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to repay, prepay or purchase the maximum aggregate principal
amount of Senior Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies
that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the
Senior Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes (and, in the case of
any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari
Passu Indebtedness), in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date
of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the
agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and with respect to the Senior Notes, in
minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof; provided that if
such Excess Proceeds are required to be offered first to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the
holders of any other Secured Indebtedness under the terms thereof, the Company shall only be required to
make an Asset Disposition Offer following the closing of the offer period in relation to the ABL Facility,
the Senior Secured Notes or such other Secured Indebtedness. The Company will deliver notice of such
Asset Disposition Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent
and each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Senior Notes for the specified purchase
price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than
60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and
described in such notice. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net
Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net
Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period as provided above)
or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any
purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes
surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by
holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the
Excess Proceeds among the Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased
on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness; _provided that the Company shall not be required to select and purchase Senior Notes or_
other Pari Passu Indebtedness in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset
Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is
denominated in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Senior

313


-----

Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in U.S. Dollars that is actually received by the Company
upon converting such portion into U.S. Dollars.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on
such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from
the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant during the same fiscal
year, not to exceed the greater of (a) $120.0 million and (b) 25.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the
fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the
time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable
securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in
the Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture
relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of an
Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding.

The agreements, documents and instruments entered into in connection with, or pursuant to, the ABL
Facility may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company
becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Senior Notes pursuant to this
covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes, the Company could
seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Senior Notes or could attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such
borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes under such instruments.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or series of related

314


-----

transactions being an ‘‘Affiliate Transaction’’) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(i) $50.0 million and (ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in
a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(a) $70.0 million and (b) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have
been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2)
above if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the
Company, if any.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under
‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments,’’ or any Permitted Investment;

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of,
or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, long-term
incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits
or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance,
retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on
behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the
Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any (a) transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries and (b) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity, provided that
such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other than cash, Cash
Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation is otherwise permitted under the Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or
employees of the Company, any Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly or
indirectly and including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors, officers,
contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or
for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as
these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed
or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the
extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

(7) any transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified Securitization
Financing or Receivables Facility, any disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets,

Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors or
purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary
in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company or the senior
management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less
favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated
party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity which
would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any
Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or
similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of such Person is also a director of the
Company or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company (provided, _however, that such_
director abstains from voting as a director of the Company or such direct or indirect Parent Entity
of the Company, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

(10) any (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred
Stock) of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or

capital of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (b) amendment, waiver or other
transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other
provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor

otherwise modified, will continue to satisfy the requirements described in the definition of

directly or indirectly), including to its affiliates or its designees, of annual management,

and related costs and reasonable expenses and indemnities in connection therewith and any
termination fees (including any such cash lump sum or present value fee upon the consummation
of a corporate event, including an Initial Public Offering) and (b) any customary payments by the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly,

other professional fees and expenses) related to the Transactions or any payment as contemplated
by the Transaction Agreement; and (ii) any transactions or services pursuant to the Mutual
Services Agreement and any services or transactions that are similar or incidental to the services

the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the

_provided,_ _however, that the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted_
Subsidiary of its obligations under any future amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or

clause to the extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise
disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect as determined in good
faith by the Company;

(16) any purchases by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the Company
or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock is

(26) any Permitted Tax Restructuring.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause a
Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair market
value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in the
Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the
time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to the
covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ or under one or more clauses of the
definition of ‘‘Permitted Investment’’, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be
permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under
the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness,’’ the Company will be in default of such
covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation will be deemed
to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted
under the covenant described under ‘‘—Limitation on Indebtedness’’ (including pursuant to clause (5) of
the second paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose of such clause),
calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the Relevant Testing
Period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence immediately following such
designation. Any such designation by the Company or the re-designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary to a
Restricted Subsidiary as contemplated hereby shall be evidenced to the Trustee on the date of such

318


-----

designation or re-designation by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation or re-designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following
reports following the Issue Date:

(1) within 150 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and within

information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided
that such _pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without_
unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iv) a brief description of the business,
management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions and a

may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, 90 days) following
the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Company, beginning
with the first such fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, quarterly year-to-date financial
statements (the ‘‘Quarterly Financial Statements’’) containing the following information: (i) the
Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and
unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter year to date
period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior period

creation of new consolidated financial statements), together with condensed footnote disclosure;
(ii) unaudited _pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Company,_
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations (other than the Combination) that have occurred since the beginning of the

expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in the case of a material acquisition,
acquired company financials; and (iii) an operating and financial review of the unaudited
financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, EBITDA and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Company; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any

Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive
officer of the Company or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a description
of such event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request
of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act for so long as the Senior Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are
not ‘‘affiliates’’ under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made
under any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Indenture)
shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect, including, to the extent adopted at such time, the
application of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and IFRS 16 (Leases) and any successor
standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under GAAP), on the date of such report or financial
statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods
presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on
a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any
Subsidiaries of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the
reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity
or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20.0% of the Company’s LTM EBITDA
(calculated (i) in the case of an acquisition, including any _pro forma adjustments in respect of such_
acquisition and (ii) in the case of a disposal, excluding any _pro forma adjustments in respect of such_
disposal) for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Company, then the Annual Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Statements will
include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee reports
which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it
elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and
other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this ‘‘Reports’’ covenant shall be in English, or with a certified English
translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the
equity securities of the Company or any Parent Entity (into which the financial results of the Company are
consolidated) or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (or one or more
of the equivalent regulated markets of Euronext, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Stockholm Stock
Exchange, Euronext Dublin, the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Swiss Stock Exchange, the New York
Stock Exchange or NASDAQ) (each a ‘‘Regulated Market’’) and the Company or such Parent Entity or IPO
Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure standards applicable to Issuer of equity securities
admitted to trading on a Regulated Market, for so long as it elects, the Company will make available to the

320


-----

Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Company or such Parent
Entity or such IPO Entity is, or would be, required to file with the applicable Regulated Market pursuant
to such admission and disclosure standards. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and
_provided that such requirements require the Company or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and_
file annual reports, information, documents and other reports with the applicable Regulated Market, the
Company will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity (into which
the financial results of the Company are consolidated) so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or
quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements (including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant
as if references to the Company therein were references to such Parent Entity and (b) are accompanied by
condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Entity;
(ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of any
applicable Parent Entity that are not the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis;
(iv) consolidating adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts, none of which shall be required to
be audited. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, only
Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be taken into account when making any
calculations required under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Company may comply with the requirements of clause (2) of
the first paragraph of this covenant with respect to periods ending prior to the Completion Date by
providing the revenue and EBITDA of each of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal for such period
ended together with management’s commentary thereon in a level of detail consistent with that provided in
‘‘Summary—Recent Developments and Trading’’ in this Offering Memorandum or (y) for purposes of this
covenant, the Company shall (i) be permitted to provide unaudited financial information of the Ardagh
Carve-out Business and Exal (on a consolidated, standalone, combined, pro forma or other basis) to satisfy
any requirement to provide financial information for periods (whether full, partial or comparative periods)
commencing prior to, or that include, the Completion Date, _provided that, for any applicable quarterly_
period, the Company shall provide quarterly financial statements for Exal to the extent such statements are
otherwise prepared and provided to creditors, (ii) be permitted for such periods to provide financial
information in the same format as the financial statements of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal, as
the case may be and (iii) not be required to provide any footnotes with respect to any such financial
information.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Facility, any
other Credit Facility or any Public Debt (including the Senior Secured Notes), in each case of the Issuer or
a Guarantor, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the
Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Senior Notes Guarantee, which Senior Notes Guarantee will be pari
passu in right of payment with (in the case such Guarantee of such other Indebtedness constitutes Pari
Passu Indebtedness) or senior to (in the case such Guarantee of such other Indebtedness constitutes
Subordinated Indebtedness) as applicable, such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other
Indebtedness; _provided,_ _however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be obligated to become a_
Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Senior Notes Guarantee is contrary to
the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous

321


-----

restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the
case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the
case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such
partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other
than reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Company, any Senior Notes Guarantee may
contain limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses
generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or
defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Senior Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
‘‘Senior _Notes Guarantees—Senior Notes Guarantee Release.’’ The Trustee shall each take all necessary_
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any
release of a Senior Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections
and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Senior Notes Guarantees and the liability of each Guarantor will
be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks relating to Our Debt, the Notes
_and the Guarantees—Corporate benefit, capital maintenance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests and may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes and_
_the Security Interests.’’_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence by
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of (x) any Indebtedness secured on collateral securing the ABL
Facility or the Senior Secured Notes or as otherwise required herein and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness
in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (x), the Company, the relevant Restricted
Subsidiaries and the Trustee shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an ‘‘Additional Intercreditor Agreement’’) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders
(taken as a whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Senior Notes
Guarantees; _provided that (1) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal_
obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any
time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of
Holders and the Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect,
manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness
covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is
subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of
payment to the Senior Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) secure the Senior Notes (including any Additional Senior Notes)
or further secure the ABL Facility or Senior Secured Notes (including any Additional Senior Secured
Notes as defined in the ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’), (5) amend the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof or (6) make any other
change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material

322


-----

respect. The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to any
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under ‘‘Amendments and Waivers,’’ and the Company may only direct the Trustee to enter
into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or, in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities,
indemnities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment,
purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated
to the Senior Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant_
described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Note, shall be deemed to have
agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon
prior written request at our offices.

**Financial Calculations**

In the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (w) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an
acquisition (including an acquisition of assets) or other transaction or (x) assumes Indebtedness of Persons
that are, or secured by assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or merged
into, amalgamated or consolidated with, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture or (y) commits to an acquisition or transaction pursuant to which it may Incur
Acquired Indebtedness or (z) is subject to a Change of Control, the date of determination of LTM
EBITDA, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Company, be (a) the date
that a definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement for such acquisition, transaction, merger,
amalgamation, consolidation or Change of Control is entered into and the LTM EBITDA, Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving _pro forma effect to such acquisition, Change of_
Control and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) consistent with the definitions of ‘‘LTM EBITDA’’, ‘‘Fixed
_Charge Coverage Ratio’’ and ‘‘pro forma’’ as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such_
ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the target company) at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant acquisition or Change of Control, such ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result
of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such acquisition and any related
transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation
of such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation or consolidation; _provided that if the Company_
elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, put option or
similar arrangement, (i) any such transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive
agreement, put option or similar arrangement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes
of calculating any ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier of the
date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without
consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets were utilized in satisfying any

323


-----

covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier of the date of consummation of such
acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or expires without consummation of such acquisition,
but any calculation of LTM EBITDA or Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of
Indebtedness or Liens or making of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect
such acquisition until it has been consummated unless such other Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens is
conditional or contingent on the occurrence of such acquisition or Change of Control or (b) the date such
Indebtedness is borrowed or assumed or such Change of Control occurs;

**Merger and Consolidation**

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ‘‘Successor Company’’) will be (x) a Person
organized and existing under the laws of England and Wales. Germany, any member state of the
European Union or the European Economic Area, or the United States of America, any State of
the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or
Switzerland or Australia or Bermuda and (y) the Successor Company (if not the Company) will
expressly assume, by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the
obligations of the Company under the Senior Notes and the Indenture and all obligations of the
Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred and is
continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Company or the applicable
Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional $1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant
to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness’’ or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted_
Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction;

(4) any Guarantor (other than the Company), unless it is the other party to the transactions
described above, will have by supplemental indenture confirmed that its Senior Note Guarantee
will apply to such Person’s obligations under the Indenture and the Senior Notes;

(5) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Company)
comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (in the case of a Successor Company) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely
on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses (1),
(2) and (3) above; and

(6) the Holders (or the security agent in respect of the Senior Notes (if applicable) on their behalf)
will continue to have the same or substantially equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing
such equivalency any limitations required in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or
hardening periods) guarantees and security (if any) over the same or substantially equivalent
assets and over the shares (or other interests) in the Company or the Successor Company, save to

324


-----

the extent such assets or shares (or other interests) cease to exist (provided that if the shares (or
other interests) in the Company cease to exist, security will be granted (subject to the Agreed
Security Principles) over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Company under the Senior Notes and the Indenture.

The provisions set forth in this ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Guarantor other than the Company from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or
part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or another Guarantor other than the Company; or (ii) any
consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor other than the Company; provided that (A) if the
Issuer is not the surviving entities of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the
obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transactions will be permitted without compliance with this section.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase ‘‘substantially all’’ under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Note when due and payable, continued for
30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Note when
due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon
declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the Trustee on
behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture, other
than those set out in clauses (1) or (2) above;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there
may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed which is Incurred or Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, other
than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity (after
giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a ‘‘payment
_default’’); or_

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the ‘‘cross
_acceleration provision’’),_

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default
of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or the
maturity of which has been accelerated, is in excess of the greater of (x) $140.0 million and
(y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA;

325


-----

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company, the Issuer or a
Significant Subsidiary (the ‘‘bankruptcy provisions’’);

(6) failure by the Company, the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating
in excess of the greater of (x) $140.0 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, other than any
judgments covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and
creditworthy companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a
period of more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding
paragraph) after such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by
insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment
or decree which is not promptly stayed (the ‘‘judgment default provision’’);

(7) the Escrow Charge shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of
any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Escrow Charge or any such security
interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days;

(8) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Senior Notes Guarantee
of one or more Guarantors that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary (a ‘‘Significant
_Guarantor’’) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any_
reason to be in full force and effect, or is denied or disaffirmed by such Significant Guarantor or
any Person acting on behalf of it; and

(9) failure by the Issuer to consummate a Special Mandatory Redemption on the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date as described above under ‘‘Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
_Redemption.’’_

However, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the above paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Notes notify the Issuer of the Default and, with respect to clauses (4) and (6), the Company does
not cure such Default within 60 days after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company or the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may, and
the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In
the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes because an Event of Default described in
clause (4) under ‘‘Events of Default’’ has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Senior Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in
full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the
annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

326


-----

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is
continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Senior Notes will become
and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holders.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Senior Notes except as provided in the Indenture and
may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Indenture
may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of
principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Senior Note held by a non-consenting
Holder, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such
Senior Notes and its consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if
rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the ‘‘Initial Default’’) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time
periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ‘‘Certain Covenants—Reports’’ or otherwise to deliver any
notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the
delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even
though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except
to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any
remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Senior Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have requested in
writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the
exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own

327


-----

affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or
that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against all fees, losses,
liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in
writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so
long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their
status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or
otherwise modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount
of the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not
less than 90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the
Senior Notes, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Notes held by a non-consenting
Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Senior
Note (other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Senior Note (other than
provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Senior Note or change the time at
which any such Senior Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under ‘‘Optional
_Redemption’’ or ‘‘Redemption for Taxation Reasons’’;_

(4) make any such Senior Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Senior Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal
of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Senior Notes on or after the due
dates therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under ‘‘Withholding Taxes’’ that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Notes in any material respect or amends
the terms of such Senior Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of
the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes
so described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in
respect thereof;

Escrow Collateral other than in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Charge, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or

Senior Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Senior Notes and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Senior Notes Guarantee or the
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Senior Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment,
waiver or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which
require the Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of Holders
to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Senior Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) any amendment, waiver or other modification affects the rights
of the Senior Notes the consent of a majority of 90% or 75%, as the case may be, in aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Notes shall be required to consent thereto and (b) any amendment, waiver or other
modification affects only the rights of the Senior Notes, the consent of a majority or 90% or 75%, as the
case may be, in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, as applicable, shall be required to consent
thereto (and in such case, the consent of a majority of 90% or 75%, as the case may be, in aggregate
principal amount of the unaffected series of Senior Notes shall not be required to consent thereto).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Issuer, the
Trustee and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor
under any Senior Notes Document;

Senior Notes) that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any
material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Senior Notes that

termination, discharge or retaking of any Senior Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or
securing the Senior Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for
under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

-----

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Senior Notes to any provision of this ‘‘Description of
_the Senior Notes’’ to the extent that such provision in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ was_
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture or the Senior Notes;

Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Senior
Notes Document;

(9) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of
Senior Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and
administration of Senior Notes; _provided,_ _however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so_
amended would not result in Senior Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or
any other applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights
of Holders to transfer Senior Notes in any material respect;

(10) facilitate any transaction that complies with (a) the definition of ‘‘Permitted Reorganization’’ or
(b) the covenants described under the headings ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’ and ‘‘Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock’’ relating to mergers,_
consolidations and sales of assets;

(11) as provided in ‘‘Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements’’; or

(12) to amend, supplement or otherwise modify the Escrow Agreement or the Escrow Charge in ways
that would not be adverse to the Holders of Senior Notes in any material respect.

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely
on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Senior Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any
Holder given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Notes will not be rendered invalid by
such tender. The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent
fee to Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the
Senior Notes Documents (‘‘legal defeasance’’) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts,
duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith
and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Notes, registrations of Senior Notes, mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money
for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance
option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance
trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants’’ (other than clauses (1), (2) and (5) of the first paragraph
of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’) and ‘‘Change of Control’’ and the default provisions relating to such
covenants described under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment
default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect to the Issuer),

330


-----

the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provisions described
under ‘‘Events of Default’’ above (‘‘covenant defeasance’’).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding their
prior exercise of their covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option,
payment of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the
Senior Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Notes,
payment of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3)
(other than clauses (1), (2) and (5) of the first paragraph of ‘‘Merger and Consolidation’’), (4), (5) (with
respect only to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under ‘‘Events of
_Default’’ above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
‘‘defeasance trust’’) with the Trustee cash in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination
thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect beneficial
owners of Senior Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case
if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such
Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in
applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the Senior Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to
surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Senior Notes and rights of the Trustee, as expressly provided
for in the Indenture) as to all Senior Notes of a series issued thereunder when (1) either (a) all the Senior
Notes of that series previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed
Senior Notes and certain Senior Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and
thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation;
or (b) all Senior Notes of that series not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have
become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or
(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer
has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee, money in U.S. dollars, U.S. Government
Obligations or a combination thereof as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Senior Notes of that series not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for
principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Notes that have
become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer
has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered

331


-----

irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the
payment of the Senior Notes of that series at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and
(5) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating
that all conditions precedent under the ‘‘Satisfaction and Discharge’’ section of the Indenture relating to the
satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing
clauses (1), (2) and (3)). If requested in writing by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts
deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; _provided,_
_however, that the Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Issuer of such_
earlier repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt,
the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will
not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such
amounts.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Senior Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Notes. Such waiver may not
be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such
a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Citibank, N.A., London Branch is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in
such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture
will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is
not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the
Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months
may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

332


-----

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent that the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Issuer with respect to the Senior Notes will
be sent to the Authority.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as any
Senior Notes are represented by global Senior Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to DTC,
which will give such notices to the Holders of book-entry interests in accordance with the applicable
procedures of DTC, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to
such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so
mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in
it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. If a notice or
communication is given in via DTC, it is duly given on the day the notice is given to DTC.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date
for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Senior
Notes will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Restrictions**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in U.S. Dollars with respect to the Senior Notes
(the ‘‘Required Currency’’) which is made to or for the account of any Holder or the Trustee in lawful
currency of any other jurisdiction (the ‘‘Other Currency’’) whether as a result of any judgment or order or
the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of any of the Issuer, Company
or any other Guarantor shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer’s, Company’s or such Guarantor’s
obligation under the Indenture, the Senior Notes or, the Senior Notes Guarantees, as the case may be,
only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency which such Holder or the Trustee could
purchase in the New York foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Other Currency in accordance
with normal banking procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first day (other than a Saturday
or Sunday) on which banks in New York, are generally open for business following receipt of the payment
first referred to above. If the amount of the Required Currency that could be so purchased is less than the
amount of the Required Currency originally due to such Holder or the Trustee, the Issuer, Company or
such other Guarantor, as the case may be, shall indemnify and save harmless such Holder or the Trustee, as
applicable from and against all loss or damage arising out of or as a result of such deficiency. This
indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other obligations contained in
the Indenture, the Senior Notes or the Senior Note Guarantees, shall give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Trustee or any
Holder of a Senior Note from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any

333


-----

judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due hereunder or under any judgment or
order.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
U.S. Dollar-denominated restriction herein, the U.S. Dollar equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non- U.S. Dollar currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date such non- U.S. Dollar amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Senior Notes on Euronext Dublin and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Senior Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list
the Senior Notes on Euronext Dublin will be approved or that permission to deal in the Senior Notes
thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Senior Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or
permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Notes, may not be collectable
within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and
the Senior Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction
of the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in
the United States of America. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint
an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Senior
Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the
City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Senior Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, and the
Senior Notes Guarantees thereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the
Indenture and the Senior Notes may be amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a
purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes). The Escrow Agreement and the Escrow
Charge and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of England.

Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or discontinued

Global Note’’ and together with the Rule 144A Floating Rate Secured Global Note, the ‘‘Rule 144A Euro
Global Notes’’). The Senior Secured Euro Fixed Rate Notes sold to persons outside the United States to
non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S will be represented by a global note in registered form

registered form without coupons attached (the ‘‘Rule 144A Senior Global Note’’ and, together with the
Rule 144A Dollar Secured Note, the ‘‘Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes’’). The Senior Notes sold to persons

note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ‘‘Regulation S Senior Global Note’’ and,
together with the Regulation S Dollar Secured Global Note, the ‘‘Regulation S Dollar Global Notes’’).

The Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes and the Rule 144A Euro Global Notes are collectively referred to
as the ‘‘144A Global Notes.’’ The Regulation S Dollar Global Notes and the Regulation S Euro Global
Notes are collectively referred to as the ‘‘Regulation S Global Notes.’’ The Rule 144A Global Notes and
the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the ‘‘Global Notes.’’

The Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes and the Regulation S Dollar Global Notes will be deposited with
a custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The Rule 144A Euro
Global Notes and the Regulation S Euro Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream Banking.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the ‘‘Rule 144A Book-entry Interests’’) and in
the Regulation S Global Notes (the ‘‘Regulation S Book-entry Interests’’ and, together with the Rule 144A
Book-entry Interests, the ‘‘Book-entry Interests’’) will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking, or persons who hold interests through such participants. DTC,
Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants
through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective
depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-entry Interests will not be
held in definitive certificated form.

Book-entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records
maintained in the book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and their participants.
The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The

381


-----

foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-entry Interests. In addition,
while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-entry Interests will not be considered the owners or
‘‘holders’’ of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream Banking, as
applicable (or their respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all
purposes under the Indentures. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream Banking, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear,
Clearstream Banking and the participants through which they own Book-entry Interests, to transfer their
interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Indentures.

Neither we nor the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar nor any of
their respective agents will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the
Book-entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream Banking, as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-entry Interests in such
Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-entry Interests will be equal to
the amount received by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, as applicable, in connection with the
redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices
of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking, if fewer than all of a series of Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a
proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair
and appropriate; _provided,_ _however, that no Book-entry Interest of less than_ A100,000 or $200,000, as
applicable, may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

We will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes
and the Regulation S Dollar Global Notes) and to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear
and Clearstream Banking (in the case of Rule 144A Euro Global Notes and Regulation S Euro Global
Notes), which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures.
We will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be
required by law and as described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes’’
and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes.’’ If any such deduction or withholding is
required to be made, then, to the extent described under ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
Withholding Taxes’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes,’’ we will pay additional
amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or
owner of Book-entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such
holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-entry Interest, as
the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. We expect that standing customer instructions and
customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-entry Interests held through
such participants.

Under the terms of the Secured Indenture and the Senior Indenture, the Issuer and the Trustee will
treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g., DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream Banking (or their
respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Principal Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent,

382


-----

the Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect
of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream Banking or any participant or indirect participant relating
to, or payments made on account of, a Book-entry Interest or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream Banking or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or
payments made on account of, a Book-entry Interest, or DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream Banking or any
participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes and the Regulation S Dollar Global Notes, will be paid to holders of
interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and
all other amounts payable in respect of, the Rule 144A Euro Global Notes and the Regulation S Euro
Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream
Banking in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking have advised the Issuer that they will take any action
permitted to be taken by a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described
below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-entry Interests are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such
participant or participants has or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will
not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect
of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture or the Senior
Indenture, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes for definitive registered notes in certificated form (‘‘Definitive Registered Notes’’) and to distribute
Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking will be effected in
accordance with DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking rules and will be settled in immediately
available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason,
including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that require physical delivery of securities or to pledge
such Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking and in accordance with the procedures set forth
in the Secured Indenture or the Senior Indenture, as applicable.

The Global Notes for Rule 144A Book-entry Interests will have a legend to the effect set forth under
‘‘Notice to Investors.’’ Book-entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on
transfers and certification requirements discussed under ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Notes
and the closing of the offering (the ‘‘Distribution Compliance Period’’), Regulation S Book-entry Interests
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note
only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a
certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
whom the transferor reasonably believes is a ‘‘qualified institutional buyer’’ within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’ and in accordance with all applicable securities
laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

383


-----

After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, Regulation S Book-entry Interests may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-entry Interest without
compliance with these certification requirements.

Rule 144A Book-entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S
or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the U.S. Securities
Act).

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Notes.

Any Book-entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable
to Book-entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Secured Indenture and the Senior Indenture, owners of the Book-entry
Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:

   - if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream Banking notifies either Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by us within 120 days; or

   - if the owner of a Book-entry Interest requests such an exchange in writing delivered through DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream Banking following an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture or
the Senior Indenture, as applicable.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note
may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the registrar or transfer agent. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive
Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part
transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred
or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; _provided that no Definitive_
Registered Note in a denomination less than A100,000 or $200,000, as applicable, will be issued. We will
bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes.

We will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the applicable
series of Notes, (ii) any date fixed for redemption of the applicable series of Notes or (iii) the date fixed for
selection of the applicable series of Notes to be redeemed in part. Also, we are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for redemption. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive
Registered Note, the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the applicable Indenture. We may require a holder
to pay any taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the applicable Indenture and the applicable
series of Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Note has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Note is mutilated and is
surrendered to the registrar or at the office of the transfer agent, we will issue and the Trustee, upon

384


-----

receipt of an authentication order, will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the
Trustee’s and our requirements are met. Either the Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting
replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of
both to protect us, the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indentures
governing the Notes from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is
replaced. The Issuer may charge for any expenses incurred by us in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is
about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by either Issuer pursuant to
the provisions of the Indentures, such Issuer, in its discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive
Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged only after the transferor first delivers
to the Trustee a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

So long as the Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, we will
publish a notice of any issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in a newspaper having general circulation
in Ireland (which we expect to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such
rules, posted on the official website of Euronext Dublin (http://www.ise.ie).

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking**

DTC is:

  - a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;

  - a ‘‘banking organization’’ under the New York Banking Law;

  - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

  - a ‘‘clearing corporation’’ within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

   - a ‘‘clearing agency’’ registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC
participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and
certain other organizations such as the Initial Purchasers. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers, trust
companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct
participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants
and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the DTC system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may
be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that
certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the
DTC system will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Note only through DTC
participants.

The address of DTC in New York is 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041.

385


-----

**_Euroclear and Clearstream Banking_**

Our understanding with respect to the organization and operations of Euroclear and Clearstream
Banking is as follows. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking hold securities for participating organizations.
They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective
participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream Banking provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping,
administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear
and Clearstream Banking interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream Banking
participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream Banking is also
available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a
custodian relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream Banking participant, either directly or indirectly.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-entry System**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross market
transfers between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream Banking
participants, on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of
each of Euroclear or Clearstream Banking by the common depositary; however, such cross market
transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream Banking by the counterparty
in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels
time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream Banking will, if the transaction meets its settlement
requirements, deliver instructions to the common depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its
behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment in
accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear
participants and Clearstream Banking participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common
depositary.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream Banking
participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any
such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream Banking participant, during the
securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream Banking,
as the case may be) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and
Clearstream Banking as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or
Clearstream Banking participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date
of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream Banking cash account only as of the
business day for Euroclear or Clearstream Banking following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream Banking are expected to follow the foregoing procedures
in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream Banking, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform
such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee,
the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Principal Paying Agent or any of their respective agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream Banking or their respective
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**TAXATION**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax
consequences, under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes
including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or
redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein.

References in this discussion to Notes acquired, owned, held or disposed of by noteholders include,
except where otherwise expressly stated, the Book-entry Interests held by purchasers in the Notes in global
form deposited with a custodian for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC.

**Netherlands Taxation**

**_General_**

The information set out below is a general summary of certain material Dutch tax consequences in
connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the Notes. This summary is not a
comprehensive or complete description of all the Dutch tax considerations that may be relevant for a
particular holder of Notes and it does not address the tax consequences that may arise in any jurisdiction
other than The Netherlands in connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the notes. For
Dutch tax purposes, a holder of Notes may include an individual who or an entity that does not have the
legal title to the Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes, or the income thereof, are attributed based
either on such individual or entity holding a beneficial interest in the Notes or based on specific statutory
provisions.

This summary is based on the tax laws of The Netherlands as in effect on the date of this offering
memorandum, including regulations, rulings and decisions of its taxing and other authorities available in
printed form on or before this date and now in effect, in each case as applied and interpreted by Dutch
courts, without prejudice to any developments or amendments introduced at a later date and implemented
with or without retroactive effect.

Any reference in this summary to The Netherlands and to Netherlands or Dutch tax law are to the
European part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands and its law, respectively, only.

As this summary is intended as general information only, (prospective) holders of Notes should
consult their own tax advisors as to the Dutch or other tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and
transfer of Notes, including, in particular, the application to their particular situations of the tax
considerations discussed below.

Holders of Notes may be subject to a special tax treatment under any applicable law and this summary
is not intended to be applicable in respect of all categories of holders of Notes.

**_Withholding tax_**

All payments to be made by the Issuer under the Notes may be made free from withholding or
deduction for any taxes of whatsoever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by The Netherlands or
any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein.

For developments and risks in relation to the application of the proposed withholding tax on interest
payments see ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Debt, the Notes and the Guarantees—Certain
changes in Dutch tax law related to The Netherlands government’s plan to combat tax avoidance may have
an adverse effect on us and may entitle us to redeem the Notes’’

387


-----

**_Taxes on Income and Capital Gains_**

_General_

This summary is not intended for any holder of Notes:

(i) who is an individual and for whom the income or capital gains derived from the Notes are
attributable to employment activities, the income from which is taxable in The Netherlands;

(ii) who has, or that has, a Substantial Interest or a deemed Substantial Interest (as defined and
explained below) in the Issuer;

(iii) that is an entity that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands and that is, in whole
or in part, not subject to or exempt from Dutch corporate income tax (such as qualifying pension
funds);

(iv) that is an exempt investment institution (vrijgestelde beleggingsinstelling) or a fiscal investment
institution (fiscale beleggingsinstelling) as meant in articles 6a and 28 of the Dutch Corporate
Income Tax Act 1969 (Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969, ‘‘CITA’’), respectively; or

(v) who is, or that is, not considered the beneficial owner (uiteindelijk gerechtigde) of the Notes and/or
the income and/or capital gains derived from the Notes.

Generally a holder of Notes will have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer if he
holds, alone or, in case the holder is an individual, together with his partner (statutorily defined term in
Dutch tax law), whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights over, shares
representing 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital
of any class of shares) of the Issuer, or rights to acquire shares, whether or not already issued, that
represent at any time 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding
capital of any class of shares) of the Issuer, or the ownership of certain profit participating certificates that
relate to 5% or more of the annual profit or to 5% or more of the liquidation proceeds of the Issuer
(a ‘‘Substantial Interest’’).

A holder of Notes may also have a Substantial Interest in the Issuer if one of certain relatives of that
holder or of his partner has a Substantial Interest in the Issuer. If a holder of Notes does not have a
Substantial Interest, a deemed Substantial Interest will be present if (part of) a Substantial Interest has
been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, without recognizing a taxable gain.

_Dutch Resident Individuals_

A holder of Notes who is an individual and who is resident or deemed to be resident in The
Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Individual’’), will generally be subject to
Dutch income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the
Notes at the progressive rates up to 51.75% (maximum rate for 2019) if:

(i) the holder derives profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur
(ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as
an entrepreneur or a shareholder), to which enterprise the Notes are attributable or deemed to
be attributable; or

(ii) the holder derives income or capital gains from the Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as
benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden, as defined in the
Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001)), which include the performance of
activities with respect to the Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal,
_actief vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief_
_belang)._

388


-----

If neither condition (i) nor condition (ii) mentioned above applies, a Dutch Resident Individual will
generally be subject to Dutch income tax on a deemed return, regardless of the actual income or capital
gains derived from the Notes. This deemed return is calculated by applying the applicable deemed return
percentage(s) to the individual’s yield basis (rendementsgrondslag), insofar as this exceeds a certain
threshold (heffingsvrij vermogen). The individual’s yield basis is determined as the fair market value of
certain qualifying assets (including, as the case may be, the Notes) held by the Dutch Resident Individual
less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities, both determined on January 1 of the relevant
year. The deemed return percentages to be applied to the yield basis increases progressively from 1.94% to
5.60% (2019 deemed return percentages), depending on such individual’s yield basis. The deemed return
percentages will be adjusted annually. The deemed return will be taxed at a rate of 30% (rate for 2019).

_Dutch Resident Entities_

A holder of Notes that is an entity and that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands
for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Entity’’), will generally be subject to Dutch corporate
income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes. The
Dutch corporate income tax rate is 19% for the first A200,000 of the taxable amount and 25% of the
taxable amount exceeding A200,000 (rates for 2019).

_Non-Dutch Residents_

A holder of Notes who is not, nor deemed to be, a Dutch Resident Individual or a Dutch Resident
Entity (a ‘‘Non-Dutch Resident’’), is generally not subject to Dutch income tax or Dutch corporate income
tax with respect to income and capital gains derived from the Notes, provided that:

(i) such Non-Dutch Resident does not derive profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise,
whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise
(other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder) which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried
on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste
_vertegenwoordiger) in The Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the_
case may be, the Notes are attributable or deemed attributable;

(ii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual does not derive income or
capital gains from the Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous
activities performed in The Netherlands’ (resultaat uit overage werkzaamheden in Nederland, as
defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001)), which include
the performance of activities in respect of the Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio
management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also includes benefits resulting from a
lucrative interest (lucratief belang);

(iii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual is not entitled to a share in
the profits of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the
holding of securities or through an employment relationship, to which enterprise the Notes or
payments in respect of the Notes are attributable; and

(iv) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident that is an entity, such entity is neither entitled to a share in the
profits of an enterprise nor co-entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively managed in
The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities, to which enterprise the Notes or
payments in respect of the Notes are attributable.

389


-----

**_Gift and Inheritance Taxes_**

No Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will be levied on the transfer of Notes by way of gift by, or on the
death of, a holder who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for the purpose of
the relevant provisions, unless:

(i) the transfer is construed as an inheritance or bequest, or as a gift made by or on behalf of a
person who, at the time of the gift or death, is or is deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for
the purpose of the relevant provisions;

(ii) such holder dies while being resident or deemed resident in The Netherlands within 180 days
after the date of a gift of the Notes; or

(iii) the gift is made under a condition precedent and such holder is or is deemed to be resident in
The Netherlands at the time the condition is fulfilled.

For purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance tax, an individual who is of the Dutch nationality will be
deemed to be resident in The Netherlands if he/she has been resident in The Netherlands at any time
during the ten years preceding the date of the gift or his/her death.

For purposes of Dutch gift tax, an individual will, irrespective of his nationality, be deemed to be
resident in The Netherlands if he/she has been resident in The Netherlands at any time during the twelve
months preceding the date of the gift. The same twelve month rule may apply to entities that have
transferred their seat of residence out of The Netherlands. Applicable tax treaties concluded by The
Netherlands may override such deemed residency.

**_Value Added Tax_**

No Dutch value added tax (omzetbelasting) is payable by a holder of Notes in respect of the purchase
of the Notes pursuant to this offering (other than value added taxes due on fees payable in respect of
additional services not exempt from Dutch value added tax).

**_Other Taxes or Duties_**

No Dutch registration tax, capital tax, customs duty, stamp duty or any other similar tax or duty, other
than court fees, will be payable in The Netherlands by a holder of Notes in respect of or in connection with
the acquisition, ownership or transfer of the Notes.

**_Residence_**

A holder of Notes will not become or be deemed to become a resident of The Netherlands solely by
reason of the acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes.

**United States Federal Income Taxation**

The following summary describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
with respect to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of Notes by a U.S. Holder (as defined below).
This summary applies only to U.S. Holders who purchase Notes for cash in this offering at the applicable
price indicated on the cover of this Offering Memorandum and who will hold the Notes as capital assets. It
does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a
decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable
to U.S. Holders that may be subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following:
(i) banks or other financial institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in securities or
currencies; (iv) tax exempt entities; (v) persons who will hold Notes as part of a “hedging” or “conversion”
transaction or as a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “synthetic security” or other integrated
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (vi) U.S. Holders who have a “functional currency” other

390


-----

than the U.S. dollar; (vii) regulated investment companies; (viii) partnerships and other pass-through
entities or arrangements (and investors therein); (ix) persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful
permanent residents of the United States; (x) U.S. Holders who hold Notes through a non-U.S. broker or
other non-U.S. intermediary; and (xi) persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item
of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an ‘‘applicable financial statement’’
(as defined in Section 451 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’)). Further,
this summary does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax
consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences (such as, U.S. federal estate and gift tax
consequences, or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) or any U.S. state and local or foreign tax
consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of Notes.

This summary is based on the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. All of the foregoing are subject to
change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below.

For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation,
or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state
thereof, or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income
taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise
primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority
to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996 and has
properly elected to continue to be treated as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement for
U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in or owner of the partnership
or other pass-through entity or arrangement generally will depend upon the status of the partner or owner
and the activities of the entity. A person that is a partner in a partnership or other pass-through entity or
arrangement that is considering investing in Notes should consult its own tax adviser.

Each prospective investor should consult its own tax adviser with respect to the U.S. federal (including
income, Medicare, estate and gift), state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning and
disposing of Notes. Holders should also review the discussion under ‘‘Netherlands Taxation’’ for the Dutch
tax consequences to a holder of the ownership of Notes.

In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated principal on the
Notes or retire the Notes before their stated maturity dates. See, e.g., ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured
Notes—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control.’’ Notwithstanding
these possibilities, we do not believe that the Notes are contingent payment debt instruments for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and, consequently, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment
debt instruments. If, notwithstanding our view, any of the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt
instruments, a U.S. Holder generally would be required to accrue ordinary income at a rate in excess of the
stated interest rate on such Notes and to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain
recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of such Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes
that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

This discussion assumes that the Notes will be issued with no more than a _de minimis amount of_
original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This will be the case if the excess, if
any, of the Notes’ stated principal amount over their issue price is less than .25% of the Notes’ stated
principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue date to maturity. U.S. Holders
of Notes issued with more than a _de minimis amount of OID generally will be required to include such_
OID in income (as ordinary income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis), in advance of the
receipt of any cash attributable to such OID, regardless of their regular method of tax accounting for U.S.

391


-----

federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers as to the particular U.S.
federal income tax consequences applicable to them if the Notes are issued with OID.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Stated interest paid on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at
the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and who
receives a payment of stated interest in Euro (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid
stated interest upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note) will
be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the Euro payment received (determined based on
the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received), regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted to U.S. dollars at that time. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not realize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to
the actual disposition of the Euro received.

A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will
accrue euro-denominated stated interest income in euro and translate that amount into U.S. dollars based
on the average spot rate of exchange in effect for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period
that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within the
applicable taxable year. Alternatively, an accrual method U.S. Holder may elect to translate stated interest
income received in euro into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual
period (or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the last day of such partial
accrual period) or, if the date of receipt is within five business days of the last day of the interest accrual
period, the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder that makes this election must apply
it consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot change the
election without the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’).

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will
recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued euro-denominated stated interest
income on the date the interest payment (or proceeds from a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or
other disposition attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest) is actually received. The amount of
foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value
of the euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is
received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of stated interest income that has
accrued during the accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss generally will be treated, for U.S. foreign tax
credit purposes, as U.S. source ordinary income or loss, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment
to interest income or expense.

For most U.S. Holders, interest income with respect to the Notes will constitute ‘‘passive category’’
income, which may be relevant in calculating the U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation. The rules
governing foreign tax credits are complex and, therefore, U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisers regarding the availability of foreign tax credits in their particular circumstances.

**_Disposition of a Note_**

Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder
generally will recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on
such disposition (except to the extent any amount realized is attributable to accrued but unpaid stated
interest, which is taxable as described under ‘‘—Payments of Stated Interest’’) and the U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in the Note.

392


-----

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will be (i) with respect to a dollar-denominated Note, the
cost at which a U.S. Holder acquires such Note or (ii) with respect to a euro-denominated Note, the U.S.
dollar value of the euro paid for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase
(which generally should be the closing date). The amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency generally will be the
U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note is
disposed of; provided, however, that if the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis
taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign
currency on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election
described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder
and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If a Note is not traded on an established securities
market (or, if a Note is so traded, but a U.S. Holder is an accrual basis taxpayer that has not made the
settlement date election), a U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as
ordinary income or loss not treated as interest income or expense) to the extent that the U.S. dollar value
of the euro received (based on the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date) differs from the U.S.
dollar value of the amount realized.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss
realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be
treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year at the time of the
disposition of the Note. For certain non-corporate holders (including individuals), any such long-term
capital gain is subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations.

Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss not
treated as interest income or expense. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price for the
Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note is disposed of, and (ii) the U.S. dollar
value of the purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note was
acquired (or, in each case, determined on the settlement date if the Notes are traded on an established
securities market and the holder is either a cash basis or an electing accrual basis holder). Payments
received that are attributable to accrued interest will be treated in accordance with the rules applicable to
payments of interest described above. Any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect
to accrued interest) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder
on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note. Generally, the
foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss for U.S. foreign tax
credit purposes.

**_Exchange of Foreign Currencies_**

A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in any euro received as interest or on the sale or other disposition of a Note
will be the U.S. dollar value of such euro at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of receipt of the
euro. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange or other disposition of the euro will
be ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source income or loss not treated as interest income
or expense for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

U.S. Treasury regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions cover
certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions
giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an individual or
trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition

393


-----

of a foreign currency Note or of foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency Note. Persons
considering the purchase of the Notes should consult with their own tax advisers regarding the tax return
disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes or the disposition of euro,
including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Statement), and including the
significant penalties for non-compliance with this requirement.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Certain U.S. Holders may be required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes,
subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain U.S.
financial institutions). U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, of this
legislation on their ownership and disposition of the Notes including the significant penalties for
non-compliance with this requirement.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

In general, information reporting requirements may apply to certain payments to a U.S. Holder of
interest on the Notes and to the proceeds of a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition (including a
retirement or redemption) of a Note unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient, and, when required,
provides evidence of such exemption. Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) may be required on
such amounts if the U.S. Holder fails to furnish the U.S. Holder’s taxpayer identification number or
otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Certain exempt U.S.
Holders (including, among others, corporations) are not subject to the backup withholding and
information reporting requirements.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules from a payment to a U.S. Holder generally may be claimed as a credit against such U.S. Holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability (if any) and any excess may result in a refund, _provided that the required_
information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions stated in the purchase agreement dated the date of this Offering
Memorandum, the Initial Purchasers have severally agreed to purchase and we have agreed to sell to the
Initial Purchasers, the entire principal amount of the Notes.

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to purchase the Notes
are subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and to other conditions. The Initial Purchasers must
purchase all of the Notes if they purchase any of the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers propose to resell the Notes at the offering prices set forth on the cover page of
this Offering Memorandum within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and to non-U.S.
persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. The price at which the Notes are offered
may be changed at any time without notice.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or
any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account
or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) except in transactions exempt from, or not subject
to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See ‘‘Notice to Investors.’’

The Initial Purchasers may use affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the
Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, in jurisdictions in which they are otherwise not
permitted.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of the Secured
Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, within the United States by a dealer that is not participating in
this offering may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if that offer or sale is
made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A.

Each Initial Purchaser has severally represented and agreed that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to
be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by them in connection with the issuance or sale of
the Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of
the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or any Guarantor; and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by them in relation to the Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, in,
from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2019 which will be
the tenth business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being referred to as
‘‘T+10’’). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are
required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise.

Application has been made for listing particulars to be approved by Euronext Dublin and for the
Notes to be admitted to the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on its Global
Exchange Market. We cannot assure you that the prices at which the Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as
applicable, will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that
an active trading market for the Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, will continue after this
offering. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market in the Secured
Notes and the Senior Notes. However, they are not obligated to do so, and they may discontinue any
market-making activities with respect to the Secured Notes and the Senior Notes at any time without
notice. In addition, market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and
may be limited. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that you will be able to sell your Secured Notes or

395


-----

Senior Notes, as applicable, at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be
favorable.

In connection with this offering, the Initial Purchasers are not acting for anyone other than us and will
not be responsible to anyone other than us for providing the protections afforded to their clients or for
providing advice in relation to this offering.

Buyers of the Secured Notes and the Senior Notes sold by the Initial Purchasers may be required to
pay stamp taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the initial offering price set forth on the cover of this Offering Memorandum.

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell notes in the open market.
Purchases and sales in the open market may include short sales, purchases to cover short positions and
stabilizing purchases.

   - Short sales involve secondary market sales by the Initial Purchasers of a greater number of Notes
than it is required to purchase in the offering.

   - Covering transactions involve purchases of Notes in the open market after the distribution has been
completed in order to cover short positions.

   - Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase notes so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum.

Purchases to cover short positions and stabilizing purchases, as well as other purchases by the Initial
Purchasers for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market
price of the Notes. They may also cause the price of the Notes to be higher than the price that would
otherwise exist in the open market in the absence of these transactions. The Initial Purchasers may conduct
these transactions in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. If the Initial Purchasers commence any of
these transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

The Initial Purchasers are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may
include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and
their respective affiliates have in the past, and may in the future, perform commercial banking, investment
banking and advisory services for us from time to time for which they have received customary fees and
reimbursement of expenses and may, from time to time, engage in transactions with and perform services
for us in the ordinary course of their business for which they may receive customary fees and
reimbursement of expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade
debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (which may include
bank loans and/or credit default swaps) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and
may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and
securities activities may involve our securities and instruments.

Citigroup Global Markets Limited has served as financial adviser to Ardagh in connection with the
Combination. In addition, an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Limited will serve as trustee under the
Notes and act as security agent under the Indentures and administration agent under ABL Facility and will
receive customary fees and commissions. One or more of the Initial Purchasers or their respective
affiliates, as applicable, are or will be hedging counterparties with Ardagh. Certain of the Initial Purchasers
or their respective affiliates are lenders or agents under the Ardagh Group’s current asset-backed facility, a
portion of which will be repaid indirectly from the proceeds of this offering. At the time of any exercise of
an optional redemption or the making of an excess proceeds offer, one of more of the Initial Purchasers or
their respective affiliates may hold the Ardagh Group’s existing 4.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2023,
4.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2023, 4.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2022, 2.750% Senior Secured

396

Notes due 2024 or 6.750% Senior Notes due 2024 and as a result, indirectly receive proceeds from this
offering of Notes.

under the U.S. Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to
make because of any of those liabilities.

territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the
purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands. Upon issuance, the Secured Notes and the Senior Notes
will be guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor. On or prior to the date required by the Secured Indenture the
Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Post-Completion Date Guarantors and on or
prior to the date required by the Senior Indenture the Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by
the Post-Completion Date Guarantors. The Parent Guarantor and certain of the Post-Completion Date
Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of one of British Columbia (Canada), Denmark,
England and Wales, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Furthermore,
most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and such Guarantors live outside the United
States. Substantially all of the assets of Trivium Packaging Finance B.V. and the Guarantors (other than the
Post-Completion Date Guarantors in Delaware and Ohio (United States)), and substantially all of the
assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not
be possible for you to serve process on such persons in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained
in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States.
In addition, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish counsel have informed us
that it is questionable whether an Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in Denmark, The
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland or Spain predicated solely upon U.S.
federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against any Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any
Post-Completion Date Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will
need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. We
have been advised by counsel that there is doubt that a foreign judgment based upon United States federal
or state securities laws would be enforced in British Columbia (Canada), Denmark, England and Wales,
France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, The Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Therefore, a final judgment for the
payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability,
whether or not based on United States federal or state securities laws, would not be automatically
enforceable in such countries. You should consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as
needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

The statute of limitations applicable to payment of interest and repayment of principal under New
York law is six years.

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED COMBINED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1. General information**

The Metal Food & Specialities Business (the ‘‘Business’’) has historically operated as part of Ardagh
Group S.A. (‘‘Ardagh’’ or ‘‘the Ardagh Group’’) and not as a separate stand-alone entity or group.

The Business is a leading global supplier of sustainable, innovative, value-added rigid metal packaging
solutions to the consumer products industry. The Business supplies metal packaging to a wide range of
consumer-driven end-use categories including food (processed food such as fruit, vegetables, soups, sauces,
ready meals and pet food), seafood, aerosols (personal care and household products), nutrition and
custom (including dairy and infant nutrition powders), and paints and coatings. We serve over 1,200
customers across more than 70 countries, comprised of multinational companies, large national and
regional companies and small local businesses. In our principal target regions of Europe and North
America, our customers include a wide variety of consumer-packaged goods companies, which own some
of the best-known brands in the world. We derive approximately 93% of our annual revenues in Europe
and North America, mature markets characterized by predictable consumer spending, stable supply and
demand and low cyclicality.

The principal accounting policies of the Business that have been applied to the unaudited combined
interim financial statements are described in note 2 below.

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies**

**Basis of preparation**

The unaudited combined interim financial statements of the Business have been prepared on a
carve-out basis from the consolidated interim financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A., to represent the
financial position and performance of the Business as if the Business had existed on a stand-alone basis for
each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 for the combined income statements, statements
of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows and as at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018
for the combined statements of financial position. However, the unaudited combined interim financial
statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the Business had been a
stand alone entity during the periods presented. After making enquiries and considering the Business’
projections in the long range plan, Management consider that the Business has adequate resources to
continue operating for the foreseeable future, for this reason the unaudited combined interim financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

The unaudited combined interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standard 34, ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ (‘‘IAS 34’’). They do not include all of
the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the
combined financial statements of the Business for the year ended December 31, 2018 which were prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’).

In preparing these unaudited combined interim financial statements, the accounting policies adopted
are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the changes in accounting policies set
out below. The significant judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies of the
Business and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the
preparation of the combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, except in regard
to recognition of the income tax charge, as described below, where the guidance contained in IAS 34 for
interim financial statements has been followed.

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED COMBINED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The unaudited combined interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollar, rounded to the
nearest million, and have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following:

   - derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value; and

   - employee benefit obligations are measured at the present value of the future estimated cash flows
related to benefits earned and pension assets valued at fair value.

The preparation of unaudited combined interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS
requires the use of critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in
the process of applying accounting policies, which have been applied consistently through the unaudited
combined interim financial statements of the Business. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are
based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances and are subject to continual re-evaluation. These estimates,
assumptions and judgments were historically deemed to be reasonable and prudent. However, actual
outcomes may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity,
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the unaudited combined interim financial
statements, are discussed in the critical accounting estimates and judgments.

The unaudited combined interim financial statements have been prepared by aggregating financial
information from the components of the Business, as described in note 1, together with assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the Business
including related party borrowings, and direct and indirect costs and expenses related to the operations of
the Business. The following summarizes the principles applied in preparing the unaudited combined
interim financial statements:

  - Controlled companies that are part of the Business and were acquired or disposed of during the
financial periods presented have been included in the unaudited combined interim financial
statements from and up to the date control was passed. Goodwill, customer relationship intangible
assets and fair value adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition of the controlled companies
that are part of the Business by Ardagh, have been included in the unaudited combined interim
financial statements;

   - The Business did not in the past form a separate legal group and therefore it is not possible to show
issued share capital or a full analysis of reserves. The net assets of the Business are represented by
the cumulative investment of Ardagh in the Business, shown as invested capital;

  - Certain intercompany balances between Ardagh and the Business are deemed to be long term
funding in nature and have been presented as part of invested capital in the unaudited combined
interim financial statements;

   - All intercompany balances, investments in subsidiaries and share capital within the Business have
been eliminated upon combination in the unaudited combined interim financial statements;

   - All employee benefit obligations are directly attributable to the Business and are obligations of the
combined entities;

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

   - Cumulative translation differences directly attributable to the controlled companies that are part of
the Business, have been allocated at the amounts included in Ardagh’s consolidated financial
statements;

  - Ardagh operates a central treasury function. Interest on related party borrowings and allocated
costs and expenses as described below have generally been deemed to have been paid by the
Business to Ardagh in the year in which the costs were incurred. In addition, all external debt used
to fund Ardagh’s operations is managed and held centrally. Related party borrowings and accrued
interest payable to Ardagh, representing certain components of the Ardagh Group’s corporate
debt, is included in the unaudited combined interim financial statements reflecting the debt
obligation and related interest costs of the Business;

  - For the purposes of the preparation of these unaudited combined interim financial statements,
shared corporate head office and divisional costs attributable to the Business have been included in
selling, general and administration (‘‘SGA’’) expenses, based primarily on revenue, Adjusted
EBITDA, head count and IT users as deemed appropriate, with settlement of these costs recorded
within invested capital. The allocation to the Business reflects all the costs of doing business and
Management believes that the allocation is reasonable. The support functions provided to the
Business by Ardagh include the following categories:

a) Centralized support functions;

b) Information technology;

c) Finance, tax and treasury;

d) Board; and

e) Other.

The amounts for each of these functions within the unaudited combined interim financial statements
are set out below:

These costs reflected the arrangements that existed in Ardagh for the periods presented and are not
necessarily representative of costs that may arise in the future.

   - In the unaudited combined interim financial statements, income tax expense is recognized based on
management’s estimate of the weighted average annual effective income tax rate expected for the

full financial year as required by IAS 34. Tax charges and credits and balances in the unaudited
combined interim financial statements have been calculated as if the Business was a separate
taxable entity using the separate return method. The tax charges and credits recorded in the
unaudited combined income statement and tax balances recorded in the unaudited combined
interim statement of financial position have been affected by the taxation arrangements within
Ardagh, and are not necessarily representative of the positions that may arise in the future.
Differences between the tax charges and credits and balances in the unaudited combined interim
financial statements, and the tax charges and credits and balances in the historical records of the
Business are included in invested capital.

  - Ardagh has historically assessed and managed the hedging risks and arrangements of the Business
centrally. The derivatives used in hedging transactions and relationships are highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. In the unaudited combined interim
financial statements the hedging arrangements entered into by the Business have been reflected
based on Ardagh’s previous arrangements and are not necessarily representative of the hedging
arrangements that may arise in the future.

The unaudited combined interim financial statements are authorized for issuance on June 13, 2019.

**Recently adopted accounting standards and changes in accounting policies**

**_IFRS 16 ‘Leases’_**

IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ (‘‘IFRS 16’’) sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation
and disclosure of leases. The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information in
a manner that appropriately represents those transactions. This information provides a basis for users of
financial statements to assess the effect that leases have on the financial position, financial performance
and cash flows of an entity. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17, ‘Leases’ (‘‘IAS 17’’), and later interpretations
including IFRIC 4, ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’ (‘‘IFRIC 4’’), and has
resulted in the majority of the operating leases held by the Business being recognized on the combined
statement of financial position. Under IFRS 16, at the lease commencement date, the Business recognizes
a lease liability as the present value of expected future lease payments, excluding any amounts which are
variable based on the usage of the underlying asset and a right-of-use asset generally at the same amount
plus any directly attributable costs.

The Business adopted IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019 applying the simplified approach, with the
right-of-use assets being calculated as if IFRS 16 had always been applied and the lease liabilities being
calculated as the present value of expected future lease payments, which resulted in the Business retaining
prior period figures as reported under the previous standards and recognizing the cumulative effect of
applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to invested capital as at the date of initial adoption. Upon adoption, the
Business has availed of the practical expedients to use hindsight in determining the lease term where the
contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease and has also elected not to apply IFRS 16 to
contracts that were not identified before as containing a lease under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The Business
has made an accounting policy election to combine lease and non-lease components.

The Business has completed its assessment and adopted IFRS 16 as of its January 1, 2019 effective
date. This involved the establishment of a cross-functional project team to implement the new standard.
The Business has gathered and assessed the data relating to approximately 800 leases to which the

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Business is party to and have designed and implemented a system solution and business process, with
appropriate internal controls applied, in order to meet the new accounting and disclosure requirements
post-adoption. The Business leases various types of assets, with lease terms being negotiated on an
individual basis and subject to a wide range of different terms and conditions. Extension options or periods
after termination options have been considered by management if it is reasonably certain that the lease is
extended or not terminated.

The principal impact on the unaudited combined interim financial statement of financial position as at
the adoption date of January 1, 2019, were an increase in property, plant and equipment of $67 million due
to the recognition of right-of-use assets, and an increase in borrowings, as lease liabilities of $75 million
were recognized based on the new treatment. As a result of the aforementioned impacts, deferred tax
assets increased by $2 million.

Cash generated from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019, increased by $4 million
due to certain lease expenses no longer being recognized as operating cash outflows following the adoption
of IFRS 16, however this is principally offset by a corresponding increase in cash used in financing
activities due to repayments of the principal on lease liabilities.

In addition to the above impact, the adoption of IFRS 16 also had an impact on the unaudited
combined interim income statement and certain of the Business’ key financial metrics as a result of
changes in the classification of charges recognized in the unaudited combined interim income statement.
The application of the new standard decreased both cost of sales and operating costs (excluding
depreciation) in the income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted EBITDA for the
three month ended March 31, 2019 of $5 million, offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and net
finance expense.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities recognized upon
adoption of IFRS 16 was 5.4%. The total lease liability recognized at January 1, 2019 reconciles as follows
to the total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed by the Business as of
December 31, 2018:

Please refer to notes 5, 6 and 7 for further information related to the leasing activities of the Business.

**_IFRIC 23—Uncertainty over income tax treatments_**

The IFRS Interpretations Committee issued IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over income tax treatments’
(‘‘IFRIC 23’’), which clarifies how the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 12 ‘Income
taxes’ are applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.

The Business applied IFRIC 23 effective January 1, 2019. The application of this interpretation does
not have a material impact on the unaudited combined interim financial statements of the Business.

**Recent changes in accounting pronouncements**

The impact of new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations issued and
effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 have been assessed by the Business and,
with the exception of those identified above, no new standards or amendments to existing standards
effective January 1, 2019 are currently relevant for the Business. The Business’ assessment of the impact of
new standards, which are not yet effective and which have not been early adopted by the Business, on the
unaudited combined interim financial statements and disclosures is on-going.

**3. Segment analysis**

The two operating and reportable segments of the Business are Europe and North America. This
reflects the basis on which the Business performance is reviewed.

Net finance expense is not allocated to segments as this is reviewed on a Business-wide basis.
Performance of the segments is assessed based on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA consists of
profit/(loss) before income tax charge/(credit), net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and
exceptional operating items. Segment revenues are derived from sales to external customers. Intersegmental revenue is not material.

Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested annually for impairment following the approval
of the annual budget (normally at the end of the financial year), or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Management has considered whether any impairment
indicators existed at the reporting date noting there were none, and has considered the carrying amount of
the respective goodwill and concluded that it is fully recoverable as at March 31, 2019.

The Business’ lease obligations of $88 million primarily reflect $75 million lease liabilities recognized
on the initial adoption of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019, as well as $12 million of new leases and $3 million
of principal repayments in the three months ended March 31, 2019.

The fair value of the non-current related party and other borrowings is as follows:

**At March 31, 2019** **At December 31, 2018**
**Carrying value** **Fair value** **Carrying value** **Fair value**
**$’m** **$’m** **$’m** **$’m**
Related party and other borrowings . . . . . . . . . . . . . 472 484 407 398

The Business uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments:

Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the period.

**Fair value methodology**

Fair values are calculated as follows:

(i) Non-current related party borrowings—The fair value of the non-current related party
borrowings of the Business is linked to quoted market prices for Ardagh’s corporate debt,
considering the credit risk of the Business and represent Level 2 inputs.

(ii) Current related party borrowings—The fair value of the current related party borrowings are
equivalent to their carrying value, given these related party borrowings are short-term in nature.

(iii) Lease obligations and other borrowings—The carrying amount of finance leases and other
borrowings is assumed to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.

(iv) Metal forward contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts—The fair value of these
derivatives are based on quoted market prices and represent Level 2 inputs.

**8. Employee benefit obligations**

Employee benefit obligations at March 31, 2019 have been reviewed in respect of the latest discount
rates and asset valuations. A re-measurement loss of $17 million (2018: gain of $5 million) has been
recognized in the unaudited combined interim statement of comprehensive income for the three months
ended March 31, 2019.

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED COMBINED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**11. Contingencies**

**Environmental issues**

The Business is regulated under various national and local environmental, occupational health and
safety and other governmental laws and regulations relating to:

  - the operation of installations for manufacturing of metal packaging and surface treatment using
solvents;

   - the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

  - the emission of substances and physical agents into the environment;

   - the discharge of waste water and disposal of waste;

  - the remediation of contamination;

   - the design, characteristics, collection and recycling of its packaging products; and

  - the manufacturing, sale and servicing of machinery and equipment for the container metal
packaging industry.

The Business believes, based on current information that it is in substantial compliance with
applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements. It does not believe it will be
required, under existing or anticipated future environmental laws and regulations, to expend amounts, over
and above the amounts accrued, which will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or
results of operations or cash flows. In addition, no material proceedings against the Business arising under
environmental laws are pending.

**Legal matter**

In 2015, the German competition authority (the Federal Cartel Office) initiated an investigation of
the practices in Germany of metal packaging manufacturers, including Ardagh. In 2018, the European
Commission took over this investigation and the German investigation is, as a result, at an end. The
European Commission’s investigation is ongoing, and there is at this stage no certainty as to the extent of
any charge which may arise. Accordingly, no provision has been recognized.

With the exception of the above legal matter, the Business is involved in certain other legal
proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. The Business believes that none of these
proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**12. Seasonality of operations**

The revenue and cash flows of the Business are both subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for our
products is largely related to agricultural harvest periods. Investment in working capital generally follows
the seasonal pattern of operations. The Business manages the seasonality of working capital principally by
Ardagh supplementing the operating cash flows.

**13. Events after the reporting period**

There are no material events after the reporting period relevant to the Business which would require
disclosure in these unaudited combined interim financial statements.

**_Independent auditors’ report to the directors of Ardagh Group S.A._**

**Report on the audit of the combined financial statements of the Metal Food & Specialities Business**

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the Metal Food & Specialities Business’ combined financial statements (the ‘‘financial
statements’’):

   - give a true and fair view of the company’s assets, liabilities and financial position as at 31 December
2018 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended; and

  - have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘‘IFRSs’’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

We have audited the financial statements, which comprise:

  - the Combined Statement of Financial Position as at 31 December 2018;the Combined Income
Statement and Combined Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended;

  - the Combined Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended;

  - the Combined Statement of Changes in Invested Capital for the year then ended; and

  - the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting
policies.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) (‘‘ISAs
(Ireland)’’).

Our responsibilities under ISAs (Ireland) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the
audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

_Independence_

We remained independent of the business in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Ireland, which includes IAASA’s Ethical Standard, and
we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

**Emphasis of matter**

The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is
described in Note 2 to the financial statements. In forming our opinion on the financial statements, which
is not modified, we highlight that the Metal Food & Specialities Business has not operated as a separate
entity and that the combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of results that would have
occurred if the business had been a separate stand-alone entity during the years presented or of the future
results of the combined business. The financial statements are prepared for the directors for the specific

F-21


-----

purpose as described in the Use of this report paragraph below. As a result, the financial statements may
not be suitable for another purpose.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (Ireland)
require us to report to you where:

  - the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial
statements is not appropriate; or

   - the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that
may cast significant doubt about the business’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis
of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a
guarantee as to the business’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**

The directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the
applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the business’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the business or to cease
operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

_Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
IAASA website at:

https://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6-458b-9b8f-a98202dc9c3a/
Description_of_auditors_responsibilities_for_audit.pdf

This description forms part of our auditors’ report.

_Use of this report_

This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the directors of Ardagh
Group S.A. as a body in accordance with our engagement letter dated 5 June 2019 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any
other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come.

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1. General information**

The Metal Food & Specialities Business (the ‘‘Business’’) has historically operated as part of Ardagh
Group S.A. (‘‘Ardagh’’ or ‘‘the Ardagh Group’’) and not as a separate stand-alone entity or group.

The Business is a leading global supplier of sustainable innovative, value-added rigid metal packaging
solutions to the consumer products industry. The Business supplies metal packaging to a wide range of
consumer-driven end-use categories including food (processed food such as fruit, vegetables, soups, sauces,
ready meals and pet food), seafood, aerosols (personal care and household products), nutrition and
custom (including dairy and infant nutrition powders), and paints and coatings. We serve over 1,200
customers across more than 70 countries, comprised of multi-national companies, large national and
regional companies and small local businesses. In our principal target regions of Europe and North
America, our customers include a wide variety of consumer-packaged goods companies, which own some
of the best-known brands in the world. We derive approximately 93% of our revenues in Europe and North
America, mature markets characterized by predictable consumer spending, stable supply and demand and
low cyclicality.

The principal accounting policies of the Business that have been applied to the combined financial
statements are described in note 2 below.

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies**

The Business has not previously prepared or reported any combined financial statements in
accordance with any other generally accepted accounting principles (‘‘GAAP’’). The Business has prepared
these combined financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘‘IFRS’’) and related interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(‘‘IASB’’). The Business’ deemed transition date to IFRS and its interpretations as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IASB’’) is January 1, 2016. The principles and requirements
for first time adoption of IFRS are set out in IFRS 1, ‘First-time adoption of IFRS’ (‘‘IFRS 1’’). The
requirement in IFRS 1 to provide reconciliations of financial information prepared under legacy GAAP to
IFRS is not relevant to the Business as the Business has not previously prepared or reported any financial
statements in accordance with any other generally accepted accounting principles and has availed of the
exemptions available under IFRS 1 for a subsidiary becoming a first-time adopter later than its parent. The
combined financial statements of the Business have been prepared in accordance with, and are in
compliance with, IFRS and its interpretations as issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter should
be construed as references to IFRS as issued by the IASB.

**Basis of preparation**

The combined financial statements of the Business have been prepared on a carve-out basis from the
consolidated financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A., to represent the financial position and
performance of the Business as if the Business had existed on a stand-alone basis for each of the years
ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for the combined income statements, statements of
comprehensive income and statements of cash flows and as at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 for
the combined statements of financial position. However, the combined financial statements are not
necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the Business had been a stand alone entity
during the period presented. After making enquiries and considering the Business’ projections in the long
range plan, Management consider that the Business has adequate resources to continue operating for the

F-28

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

foreseeable future, for this reason the combined financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis.

The combined financial statements, are presented in U.S. dollar, rounded to the nearest million, and
have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following:

   - derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value; and

   - employee benefit obligations are measured at the present value of the future estimated cash flows
related to benefits earned and pension assets valued at fair value.

The preparation of combined financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of critical
accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying
accounting policies, which have been applied consistently through the combined financial statements of the
Business. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
and are subject to continual re-evaluation. These estimates, assumptions and judgments were historically
deemed to be reasonable and prudent. However, actual outcomes may differ from those estimates. The
areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the combined financial statements, are discussed in the critical accounting estimates and
judgments.

The combined financial statements have been prepared by aggregating financial information from the
components of the Business, as described in note 1 and comprises the entities described in note 23,
together with assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that management has determined are specifically
attributable to the Business including related party borrowings, and direct and indirect costs and expenses
related to the operations of the Business. The following summarizes the principles applied in preparing the
combined financial statements:

  - Controlled companies that are part of the Business and were acquired or disposed of during the
financial periods presented have been included in the combined financial statements from and up to
the date control was passed. Goodwill, customer relationship intangible assets and fair value
adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition of the controlled companies that are part of the
Business by Ardagh, have been included in the combined financial statements;

   - The Business did not in the past form a separate legal group and therefore it is not possible to show
issued share capital or a full analysis of reserves. The net assets of the Business are represented by
the cumulative investment of Ardagh in the Business, shown as invested capital;

  - Certain intercompany balances between Ardagh and the Business are deemed to be long term
funding in nature and have been presented as part of invested capital in the combined financial
statements;

   - All intercompany balances, investments in subsidiaries and share capital within the Business have
been eliminated upon combination in the combined financial statements;

   - All employee benefit obligations are directly attributable to the Business and are obligations of the
entities described in note 2;

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

   - Cumulative translation differences directly attributable to the controlled companies that are part of
the Business, have been allocated at the amounts included in Ardagh’s consolidated financial
statements;

  - Ardagh operates a central treasury function. Interest on related party borrowings and allocated
costs and expenses as described below have generally been deemed to have been paid by the
Business to Ardagh in the year in which the costs were incurred. In addition, all external debt used
to fund Ardagh’s operations is managed and held centrally. Related party borrowings and accrued
interest payable to Ardagh, representing certain components of the Ardagh Group’s corporate
debt, is included in the combined financial statements reflecting the debt obligation and related
interest costs of the Business;

   - For the purposes of the preparation of these combined financial statements, shared corporate head
office and divisional costs attributable to the Business have been included in selling, general and
administration (‘‘SGA’’) expenses, based primarily on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, head count and
IT users as deemed appropriate, with settlement of these costs recorded within invested capital. The
allocation to the Business reflects all the costs of doing business and Management believes that the
allocation is reasonable. The support functions provided to the Business by Ardagh include the
following categories:

a) Centralized support functions;

b) Information technology;

c) Finance, tax and treasury;

d) Board; and

e) Other.

The amounts for each of these functions within the combined financial statements are set out below:

These costs reflected the arrangements that existed in Ardagh and are not necessarily representative
of costs that may arise in the future.

   - Tax charges and credits and balances in the combined financial statements have been calculated as if
the Business was a separate taxable entity using the separate return method. The tax charges and
credits recorded in the combined income statement and tax balances recorded in the combined
statement of financial position have been affected by the taxation arrangements within Ardagh and

are not necessarily representative of the positions that may arise in the future. Differences between
the tax charges and credits and balances in the combined financial statements, and the tax charges
and credits and balances in the historical records of the Business are included in invested capital.

  - Ardagh has historically assessed and managed the hedging risks and arrangements of the Business
centrally, as outlined in note 16. The derivatives used in hedging transactions and relationships are
highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items and are detailed in
note 17. In the combined financial statements the hedging arrangements entered into by the
Business have been reflected based on Ardagh’s previous arrangements and are not necessarily
representative of the hedging arrangements that may arise in the future.

The combined financial statements are authorized for issuance on June 13, 2019.

**Recent accounting pronouncements**

IFRS 16, ‘Leases’ is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 and sets out the
principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The objective is to
ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that appropriately represents
those transactions. This information provides a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect
that leases have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity.

IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17, ‘Leases’, and later interpretations, and will result in the majority of the
operating leases held by the Business being recognized on the combined statement of financial position.

The Business has completed an assessment of the impact of IFRS 16, involving the establishment of a
cross-functional project team to implement the new standard from January 1, 2019. The Business has
gathered and assessed the data relating to approximately 800 leases to which the Business is party, and
have designed and implemented a system solution and business process, with appropriate internal controls
applied, in order to meet the new accounting and disclosure requirements post-adoption.

The Business will adopt IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, with the
right-of-use assets being calculated as if IFRS 16 had always been applied, and avail of the practical
expedient to combine lease and non-lease components.

We expect that the adoption of IFRS 16 will have a significant impact on the combined statement of
financial position and combined statement of cash flows as follows:

  - an increase in non-current assets due to the recognition of right-of-use assets in the range of
$60 million to $70 million;

   - an increase in financial liabilities as lease liabilities are recognized based on the new treatment in
the range of $75 million to $80 million; and

  - cash generated from operations is expected to increase due to certain lease expenses no longer
being recognized as operating cash outflows, however this is expected to be offset by a
corresponding increase in cash used in financing activities due to repayments of the principal on
lease liabilities.

In addition to the above impact, the adoption of IFRS 16 will also have an impact on the combined
income statement and certain key financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges
recognized in the combined income statement. The application of the new standard will decrease both cost

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

of sales and operating costs (excluding depreciation) in the combined income statement, giving rise to an
increase in underlying Adjusted EBITDA, but this will be largely offset by corresponding increases in
depreciation and finance expenses, and hence the expected impact on the profit for the year will not be
material for the Business.

The operating lease cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 is set out in note 9 and it is the
expectation of the Business that a significant portion of those operating lease costs will be reclassified in
the combined income statement upon adoption of IFRS 16, subject to changes in exchange rates when
compared to the euro functional currency.

The IFRS Interpretations Committee issued IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over income tax treatments’,
which clarifies how the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’, are applied
where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. IFRIC 23 is effective for annual periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2019. It is not expected that the application of this interpretation will have a material
impact on the combined financial statements of the Business.

**Basis of combination**

(i) Controlled companies

Companies are fully combined from the date on which control is transferred to the Business and are
divested from the date on which control ceases. The companies included in these combined financial
statements are all entities over which the Business has control. The Business controls an entity when it is
exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of controlled companies
by the Business. The cost of an acquisition is the consideration given in exchange for control of the
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired legal entities. Directly attributable
transaction costs are expensed and included as exceptional items within sales, general and administration
expenses. The acquired net assets are initially measured at fair value. The excess of the cost of acquisition
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any goodwill and fair
value adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the acquired legal entity in the currency of the
primary economic environment in which the legal entity operates (the ‘‘functional currency’’). If the cost of
acquisition is less than the fair value of the share of the net assets of the legal entity acquired by the
Business, the difference is recognized directly in the combined income statement. The Business considers
obligations of the acquiree in a business combination that arise as a result of the change in control, to be
cash flows arising from obtaining control of the controlled company, and classifies these obligations as
investing activities in the combined statement of cash flows.

(ii) Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the equity of a controlled company which is not
attributable to the Business. Non-controlling interests are presented separately in the combined financial
statements. Changes in ownership of a controlled company which do not result in a change in control are
treated as invested capital transactions.

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

(iii) Transactions eliminated on combination

Transactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses on transactions between the controlled
companies of the Business are eliminated on combination. The accounting policies of the controlled
companies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
Business.

**Foreign currency**

(i) Presentation currency

The combined financial statements are presented in U.S. dollar which is the presentation currency of
the Business.

(ii) Foreign currency transactions

Items included in the financial statements of each of the entities included in the Business are
measured using the functional currency of that entity.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the foreign exchange
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that
date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognized in the combined income
statement, except differences on certain derivative financial instruments discussed under ‘‘Derivative
financial instruments’’ below.

(iii) Financial statements of foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations held by the Business are translated into U.S. dollars at
foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are
translated to dollars at average exchange rates for the year. Foreign exchange differences arising on
retranslation are recognized in other comprehensive income. Gains or losses accumulated in other
comprehensive income are recycled to the combined income statement when the foreign operation is
disposed of.

Non-monetary items measured at fair value in foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates
as at the date when the fair value is determined.

**Business combinations and goodwill**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting. This
involves measuring the cost of the business combination and allocating, at the acquisition date, the cost of
the business combination to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is
measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the Business elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the

F-33

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred and included in sales, general and administration expenses.

When the Business makes an acquisition, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic
circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Any contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable
assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to those
groups of cash-generating units (‘‘CGUs’’) that are expected to benefit from the business combination in
which the goodwill arose for the purpose of assessing impairment. Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of,
the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation
when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured
based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are initially recognized at cost.

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalized separately from goodwill if
the intangible asset is separately identifiable or arises from contractual or other legal rights. They are
initially recognized at cost which, for intangible assets arising in a business combination, is their fair value
at the date of acquisition.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated
amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. The carrying values of intangible assets with finite
useful lives are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment
testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.

The amortization of intangible assets is calculated to write off the book value of finite lived intangible
assets over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, on the assumption of zero residual value, as follows:

Computer software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 - 7 years
Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 - 15 years
Technology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 - 15 years

(i) Computer software

Computer software development costs are recognized as assets. Costs associated with maintaining
computer software programs are recognized as an expense as incurred.

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

(ii) Customer relationships

Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the
acquisition date. Customer relationships have a finite useful economic life and are subsequently carried at
cost less accumulated amortization.

(iii) Technology

Technology based intangibles acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the
acquisition date and reflect the ability of the Business to add value through accumulated technological
expertise surrounding product and process development and are subsequently carried at cost less
accumulated amortization.

(iv) Research and development costs

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs relating to new products are capitalized
if the new product is technically and commercially feasible. All other development costs are expensed as
incurred.

**Property, plant and equipment**

(i) Owned assets

Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses, except for land which is shown at cost less impairment. Spare parts which form an
integral part of plant and machinery and which have an estimated useful economic life greater than one
year are capitalized. Spare parts which do not form an integral part of plant and machinery and which have
an estimated useful economic life less than one year are included as consumables within inventory and
expensed when utilized.

Where components of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted
for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

(ii) Leased assets

The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease, is based on the substance of the
arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on
the use of a specific asset or assets, and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.

Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Business has substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership are classified as finance leases.

Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor)
are charged to the combined income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

F-35

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

(iii) Subsequent costs

The Business recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment, the cost
of replacing the component of such an item when that cost is incurred, if it is probable that the future
economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the Business and the replacement cost of the item
can be measured reliably. When a component is replaced the old component is de-recognized in the
period. All other costs are recognized in the combined income statement as an expense as incurred. When
a major overhaul is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as
a replacement if the recognition criteria above are met.

(iv) Depreciation

Depreciation is charged to the combined income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The
estimated useful lives are as follows:

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 - 40 years
Plant and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 40 years
Office equipment and vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 10 years

Assets’ useful lives and residual values are adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortization and are tested
annually for impairment or whenever indicators suggest that impairment may have occurred. Assets that
are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.

For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets excluding goodwill and long lived intangible assets,
are grouped at the lowest levels at which cash flows are separately identifiable. Goodwill and long lived
intangible assets are allocated to groups of CGUs. The groupings represent the lowest level at which the
related assets are monitored for internal management purposes.

Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal
of the impairment at each reporting date.

The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their value in use and fair value less costs to
sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable
amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.

**Inventories**

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based
on the first-in, first-out basis and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing

F-36


-----

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

them to their current location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost
includes direct materials, direct labor and attributable overheads based on normal operating capacity.

Net realizable value is the estimated proceeds of sale less all further costs to completion, and less all
costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Spare parts which are deemed to be of a consumable nature, are included within inventories and
expensed when utilized.

**Non-derivative financial instruments**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, contract assets, cash and
cash equivalents, borrowings and trade and other payables. Non-derivative financial instruments are
recognized initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs, except as described below.
The Business applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a
lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. Subsequent to initial
recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.

(i) Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value and are, thereafter, measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest rate method less any provision for impairment, in accordance
with the held to collect business model. A provision for impairment of specific trade receivables is
recognized by the Business when there is evidence of increased credit risk in comparison to the original
terms of the receivables. For all other trade receivables, the Business uses an allowance matrix to measure
the expected credit loss, based on historical actual credit loss experiences, adjusted for forward-looking
information.

The Business participates in certain uncommitted accounts receivable factoring and related programs
with various financial institutions for certain receivables, accounted for as true sales of receivables, without
recourse to the Business. The Business has a selling business model related to those receivables and, as
such, any unsold receivables under such programs are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.

(ii) Contract assets

Contract assets represent a right to consideration in exchange for goods or services for which control
has transferred to a customer before the customer pays consideration, relating primarily to revenue
required to be recognized over time based on production completed in accordance with the revenue
recognition policy of the Business (as set out below). The distinction between a contract asset and a trade
receivable is based on whether receipt of the consideration is conditional on something other than the
passage of time. A provision for impairment of a contract asset will be recognized when there is evidence
of increased credit risk. The provision is measured based on an allowance matrix to measure the expected
credit loss, based on historical actual credit loss experiences, adjusted for forward-looking information.

(iii) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and call deposits held with banks and restricted cash.
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost.

F-37


-----

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Short term bank deposits of greater than three months’ maturity which do not meet the definition of
cash and cash equivalents are classified as financial assets within current assets and stated at amortized
cost.

Restricted cash comprises cash held by the Business but which is ring-fenced and to which the
Business does not have unfettered access. Restricted cash is measured at amortized cost.

(iv) Borrowings (including related party borrowings)

Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and
the redemption value is recognized in the combined income statement of the Business over the period of
the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Business has an unconditional right to defer
settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

(v) Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and
are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each reporting date. The method of recognizing the
resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so,
the nature of the item being hedged.

The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 17.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining
maturity of the hedged instrument is more than twelve months after the balance sheet date and as a
current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged instrument is less than twelve months
after the balance sheet date. Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.

(i) Cash flow hedges

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash
flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges which subsequently
result in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve
within invested capital are reclassified to the asset in order to adjust its carrying value. Amounts
accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve, or as adjustments to carrying value of non-financial assets, are
recycled to the combined income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.

The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the combined income
statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for
hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing at that time remains within invested capital in equity
and is recognized in the combined income statement when the forecast cash flow arises. When a forecast

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in invested capital
is immediately transferred to the combined income statement.

**Fair value measurement**

The Business measures derivative financial instruments and pension assets at fair value at each
balance sheet date. Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and pension assets that are
measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed, are summarized in the following notes:

   - Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions (notes 17 and 18)

   - Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy (note 17)

   - Financial instruments (including those carried at amortized cost) (note 17)

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on
the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:

   - in the principal market for the asset or liability; or

   - in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Business.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants
would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best
interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to
generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market
participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Business uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which
sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and
minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

**Employee benefits**

(i) Defined benefit pension plans

Typically, defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on
retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.

The liability recognized in the combined statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit
pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value
of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are
denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

F-39


-----

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in financial and actuarial
assumptions are charged or credited to invested capital in other comprehensive income in the period in
which they arise. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the combined income statement.

(ii) Multi-employer pension plans

Multi-employer craft or industry based pension schemes (‘‘multi-employer schemes’’) have
arrangements similar to those of defined benefit schemes. In each case, however, it is not possible to
identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the multi-employer schemes of the Business and
therefore, in accordance with IAS 19(R), the Business has taken the exemption to account for multiemployer pension schemes as defined contribution schemes recognizing the contributions payable in each
period in the combined income statement.

(iii) Other end of service employee benefits

In a number of countries, the Business pays lump sums to employees leaving service. These
arrangements are accounted for in the same manner as defined benefit pension plans.

(iv) Other long term employee benefits

The obligation of the Business in respect of other long term employee benefit plans represents the
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for service in the current and prior periods
for partial retirement contracts and long service awards. These are included in the category of employee
benefit obligations on the combined statement of financial position. The obligation is computed on the
basis of the projected unit credit method and is discounted to present value using a discount rate equating
to the market yield at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent
with the currency and estimated term of the obligations. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full in
the other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

(v) Defined contribution plans

A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Business pays fixed contributions into a
separate entity. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due.

**Provisions**

Provisions are recognized when the Business has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation
and the amount can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the obligation.

**Revenue recognition**

The following is a description of the main activities from which the Business generates its revenue.

F-40


-----

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The Business is a leading supplier of sustainable innovative, value-added rigid metal packaging
solutions. The global packaging industry is a large, consumer-driven industry with stable growth
characteristics. The Business operates in the metal sector and our principal target regions are Europe and
North America. We derive approximately 93% of our revenues in Europe and North America, mature
markets characterized by predictable consumer spending, stable supply and demand and low cyclicality.
Our products are metal containers, primarily for food & speciality markets, which are characterized by
stable, consumer-driven demand. We serve over 1,200 customers across more than 70 countries, comprised
of multi-national companies, large national and regional companies and small local businesses. In our
principal target regions of Europe and North America, our customers include a wide variety of consumerpackaged goods companies, which own some of the best-known brands in the world. We have a stable
customer base with longstanding relationships. A significant portion of our sales volumes are supplied
under framework arrangements which include input cost pass-through provisions, which help us deliver
generally consistent margins.

The Business usually enters into framework agreements with its customers, which establish the terms
under which individual orders to purchase goods or services may be placed. As the framework agreements
do not identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, they do not create
enforceable rights and obligations on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, the Business has concluded that only
individual purchase orders create enforceable rights and obligations and meet the definition of a contract
in IFRS 15. The individual purchase orders have, in general, a duration of one year or less and, as such, the
Business does not disclose any information about remaining performance obligations under these
contracts. The payment terms of the Business are in line with customary business practice, which can vary
by customer and region. The Business has availed of the practical expedient from considering the existence
of a significant financing component as, based on past experience, we expect that, at contract inception, the
period between when a promised good is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that
good will be one year or less.

Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service has transferred to the customer. For certain
contracts, the Business manufactures products for customers that have no alternative use and for which the
Business has an enforceable right to payment for production completed to date. Therefore, the Business
will recognize revenue over time as the contractual performance obligations are satisfied for those
contracts. For all other contracts, the Business will continue to recognize revenue primarily on dispatch of
the goods, net of any related customer rebates, cash discounts and value added taxes.

**Exceptional items**

The combined income statement, combined statement of cash flows and segmental analysis of the
Business separately identify results before specific items. Specific items are those that in management’s
judgment need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence to provide additional
information. Such items include, where significant, restructuring, redundancy and other costs relating to
permanent capacity realignment or footprint reorganization, directly attributable acquisition costs and
acquisition integration costs, profit or loss on disposal or termination of operations, start-up costs incurred
in relation to and associated with plant builds, significant new line investments, major litigation costs and
settlements and impairment of non-current assets. In this regard, the determination of ‘‘significant’’ as
included in our definition uses qualitative and quantitative factors. Judgment is used by the Business in
assessing the particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature, are disclosed in the combined
income statement, and related notes as exceptional items. The Business considers columnar presentation

F-41


-----

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

to be appropriate in the combined income statement as it provides useful additional information and is
consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by the Business. Exceptional restructuring
costs are classified as restructuring provisions and all other exceptional costs when outstanding at the
balance sheet date are classified as exceptional items payable.

**Finance income and expense**

Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, gains on disposal of financial assets,
ineffective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments and gains on derivative
instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments and are recognized in profit or loss.

Finance expense comprises interest expense on related party borrowings, finance lease expenses,
certain net foreign currency translation gains or losses related to financing, net interest cost on net pension
plan liabilities, ineffective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments, losses on
derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments and are recognized in profit or loss,
and other finance expense.

The Business capitalizes borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or
production of manufacturing plants that require a substantial period of time to build that would have been
avoided if the expenditure on the qualifying asset had not been made.

**Income tax**

Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is
recognized in the combined income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in
other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the combined financial
statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are generally not recognized if they arise from the initial
recognition of goodwill and deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of
an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction
affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates
(and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to
apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred income tax is
provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred income tax
liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Business and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset
current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different
taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Differences between the tax charges and credits in the combined financial statements and the tax
charges and credits in the historical records of the Business are included as offset in invested capital.

**Segment reporting**

As described in note 1, the Metal Food & Specialities Business has not historically operated as a
separate stand-alone group and has been managed centrally by Ardagh. For the purposes of these
combined financial statements, the Business has two operating and reporting segments: Europe and North
America, with internal reporting provided on this basis to the Executive Committee of the Business, being
its Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘‘CODM’’). The Europe segment includes the ‘‘rest of the world’’
which accounted for 7% of total revenue in 2018 (2017: 9%, 2016: 9%). The internal information
supporting this segmental organization is used by the CODM to allocate resources and assess segmental
performance.

**Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments**

Accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. The Business makes estimates and assumptions concerning the
future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

(i) Estimated impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets

In accordance with IAS 36 ‘‘Impairment of assets’’ (‘‘IAS 36’’), the Business tests whether goodwill
and other long lived assets have suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policies stated.
The determination of the recoverable amounts of goodwill requires the use of estimates as outlined in
note 8. The judgments made by the Business relating to the impairment of goodwill and other long lived
assets are included in notes 8 and 9.

(ii) Establishing lives for the purposes of depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment
and intangibles

Long lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, customer intangibles and
technology intangibles, comprise a significant portion of the total assets of the Business. The annual
depreciation and amortization charges depend primarily on the estimated lives of each type of asset and, in
certain circumstances, estimates of fair values and residual values. The Board regularly review these asset
lives and change them as necessary to reflect current thinking on remaining lives in light of technological
change, prospective economic utilization and physical condition of the assets concerned. Changes in asset
lives can have a significant impact on the depreciation and amortization charges for the period. It is not
practical to quantify the impact of changes in asset lives on an overall basis, as asset lives are individually
determined and there are a significant number of asset lives in use.

(iii) Income taxes

The Business is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and judgment is therefore required
in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for

F-43


-----

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**2. Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued)**

which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Business
recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit matters based on estimates of whether additional taxes will
be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially
recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which
such determination is made.

(iv) Measurement of employee benefit obligations

The Business follows guidance of IAS 19(R) to determine the present value of its obligations to
current and past employees in respect of defined benefit pension obligations, other long term employee
benefits, and other end of service employee benefits which are subject to similar fluctuations in value in the
long term. The Business values its liabilities, with the assistance of professional actuaries, to ensure
consistency in the quality of the key assumptions underlying the valuations. The critical assumptions and
estimates applied are discussed in detail in note 18.

(v) Exceptional items

The combined income statement and segment analysis separately identify results before exceptional
items. Exceptional items are those that in our judgment need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature
or incidence.

The Business believes that this presentation provides additional analysis as it highlights exceptional
items. The determination of ‘‘significant’’ as included in our definition uses qualitative and quantitative
factors which remain consistent from period to period. The Business uses judgment in assessing the
particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature, are disclosed in the combined income statement
and related notes as exceptional items. Management considers the combined income statement
presentation of exceptional items to be appropriate as it provides useful additional information and is
consistent with the way that financial information is measured by and presented to management. In that
regard, management believes it to be consistent with paragraph 85 of IAS 1 ‘‘Presentation of financial
statements’’ (‘‘IAS 1’’), which permits the inclusion of line items and subtotals that improve the
understanding of performance.

(vi) Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service has transferred to the customer. For certain
contracts, the Business manufactures products for customers that have no alternative use and for which the
Business has an enforceable right to payment for production completed to date. The determination of
goods or contracts having no alternative use and the enforceable right to payment involves and relies upon
management judgment, and can result in the Business accelerating the recognition of revenue over time as
the Business satisfies the contractual performance obligations for those contracts.

(vii) Business combinations and goodwill

Goodwill only arises in business combinations. The amount of goodwill initially recognized is
dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and
the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based, to a
considerable extent, on management’s judgment. Allocation of the purchase price affects the results of the
Business as finite lived intangible assets are amortized, whereas indefinite lived intangible assets, including
goodwill, are not amortized and could result in differing amortization charges based on the allocation to
indefinite lived and finite lived intangible assets.

**3. Segment analysis**

The two operating and reportable segments of the Business are Europe and North America. This
reflects the basis on which the Business performance is reviewed.

Net finance expense is not allocated to segments as this is reviewed on a Business-wide basis.
Performance of the segments is assessed based on Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA consists of
profit/(loss) before income tax charge/(credit), net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and
exceptional operating items. Segment revenues are derived from sales to external customers. Intersegmental revenue is not material.

Segment assets consist of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, derivative financial
instrument assets, deferred tax assets, other non-current assets, inventories, contract assets, trade and
other receivables and cash and cash equivalents. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as
those in the combined financial statements of the Business as set out in note 2.

(iii) Subsequent costs

The Business recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment, the cost
of replacing the component of such an item when that cost is incurred, if it is probable that the future
economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the Business and the replacement cost of the item
can be measured reliably. When a component is replaced the old component is de-recognized in the
period. All other costs are recognized in the combined income statement as an expense as incurred. When
a major overhaul is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as
a replacement if the recognition criteria above are met.

**6. Income tax (Continued)**

Profit before tax in the combined financial statements of the Business is multiplied by the standard
rate of Luxembourg corporation tax, consistent with the presentation in the consolidated financial
statements of Ardagh Group S.A.

The total income tax charge outlined above for each year includes tax credits of $4 million in 2018
(2017: $14 million; 2016: $7 million) in respect of exceptional items, being the tax effect of the items set out
in note 4. The $14 million exceptional income tax credit recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017
includes a credit of $6 million on remeasurement of deferred tax positions following the enactment of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (‘‘TCJA’’) in the United States of America.

Tax credits relating to the re-measurement of deferred tax positions of $4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2016 is attributable to the progressive reduction in the French corporate income tax rate,
which will apply when the existing temporary differences reverse, from 33.33% to 28%. On December 22,
2017, the TCJA was signed into U.S. law. On re-measurement of the Business’ deferred tax positions
following the enactment of the TCJA, a one-time non-cash benefit of $6 million was recorded to the
income statement of the year ended December 31, 2017. This credit reflects a reduction in the U.S. net
deferred tax liability of the Business due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, which will
apply when the existing temporary differences reverse, from the existing rate of 35% to 21% with effect
from January 1, 2018. The additional tax credit on re-measurement of deferred tax positions of $3 million
in the year ended December 31, 2017 is attributable to the further progressive reduction in the French
corporate income tax rate, which will apply when the existing temporary differences reverse, from 28% to
25%. Tax credits relating to the re-measurement of deferred tax positions of $4 million in the year ended
December 31, 2018 is attributable to the progressive reduction in the Dutch corporate income tax rate,
which will apply when the existing temporary differences reverse, from 25% to 20.5%.

Income taxed at non-standard rates takes account of foreign tax rate differences (versus the
Luxembourg standard rate of 26.01%) on earnings.

**Goodwill**

**Allocation of goodwill**

Goodwill has been allocated to groups of CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. The groupings
represent the lowest level at which the related goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill acquired through business combination activity is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit
from synergies arising from that combination.

The lowest level within the Business at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management
purposes and consequently the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated, is set out below:

**Impairment tests for goodwill**

The Business performs its impairment test of goodwill annually following approval of the Ardagh
Group’s annual budget.

**Recoverable amount and carrying amount**

The Business used the value in use (‘‘VIU’’) model for the purposes of the goodwill impairment
testing as this reflects the Business’ intention to hold and operate the assets.

The VIU model used the 2019 budget prepared by the Ardagh Group and a two year forecast for 2020
to 2021 (2017: one-year budget; 2016: two-year budget; 2015: two-year budget). The budget and forecast
results were then extended for a further two-year period (2017: four-year period; 2016: three-year period;
2015: three-year period) making certain assumptions including that long-term capital expenditure equals
depreciation and that any increase in input cost will be passed through to customers, in line with historic
practice and contractual terms.

The terminal value assumed long-term growth in line with long-term inflation.

Cash flows considered in the VIU model included the cash inflows and outflows related to the
continuing use of the assets over their remaining useful lives, expected earnings, required maintenance
capital expenditure, depreciation and working capital.

The discount rate applied to cash flows in the VIU model was estimated using our weighted average
cost of capital as determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model with regard to the risks associated with
the cash flows being considered (country, market and specific risks of the asset).

The modelled cash flows take into account the established history of earnings of the Business, cash
flow generation and the nature of the markets in which it operates, where product obsolescence is low. The
key assumptions employed in modelling estimates of future cash flows are subjective and include projected

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**8. Intangible assets (Continued)**

Adjusted EBITDA, discount rates and growth rates, replacement capital expenditure requirements, rates
of customer retention and the ability to maintain margin through the pass through of input cost inflation.

For all CGUs, a sensitivity analysis was performed reflecting potential variations in terminal growth
rate and discount rate assumptions. In all cases the recoverable values calculated were in excess of the
carrying values of the CGUs. The variation applied to terminal value growth rates and discount rates was a
50 basis points decrease and increase respectively and represents a reasonably possible change to the key
assumptions of the VIU model. Further, a reasonably possible change to the operating cash flows would
not reduce the recoverable amounts below the carrying value of the CGUs.

The additional disclosures required under IAS 36 in relation to significant goodwill amounts arising in
the groups of CGUs are as follows:

Deferred tax assets are only recognized on tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that the realization of
the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable based on management’s forecasts. The
Business did not recognize deferred tax assets of $15 million (2017: $23 million, 2016: $18 million, 2015:
$21 million) in respect of tax losses amounting to $77 million (2017: $113 million, 2016: $95 million, 2015:
$105 million) that can be carried forward against future taxable income due to uncertainty regarding their
utilization.

**11. Deferred income tax (Continued)**

No provision has been made for temporary differences applicable to investments in subsidiaries as the
Business is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that
the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Given that exemptions and tax credits
would be available in the context of the Business’ investments in subsidiaries in the majority of jurisdictions
in which it operates, the aggregate amount of temporary differences in respect of which deferred tax
liabilities have not been recognized would not be material.

The majority of the provision above relates to balances which are more than six months past due. The
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable set
out above.

**Provisions against specific balances**

Significant balances are assessed for evidence of increased credit risk. Examples of factors considered
are high probability of bankruptcy, breaches of contract or major concession being sought by the customer.
Instances of significant single customer related bad debts are rare and there is no significant concentration
of risk associated with particular customers.

**Providing against the remaining population of customers**

The Business monitors actual historical credit losses and adjusts for forward-looking information to
measure the level of expected losses. Adverse changes in the payment status of customers of the Business,
or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on receivables owing to the Business,
may also provide a basis for an increase in the level of provision above historic loss experience.

As of December 31, 2018, trade receivables of $26 million (2017: $19 million; 2016: $13 million; 2015:
$21 million) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of independent customers for whom
there is no recent history of default. The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

Within cash and cash equivalents, the Business had $4 million of restricted cash at December 31, 2018
(2017: $6 million; 2016: $6 million; 2015: $8 million) which principally related to early retirement plans in
Germany.

**16. Financial risk factors**

The activities of the Business expose it to a variety of financial risks: capital risk, currency exchange
risk, commodity price risk and credit risk.

**Capital risk**

The Business does not have its own treasury function. Treasury and financial risk management is
carried out by a central Ardagh Group Treasury team under policies approved by the board of directors of
Ardagh. As described in note 2, the related party borrowings reported within these financial statements
comprise intercompany debt from Ardagh Group. The debt of the Business in these combined financial
statements has fixed interest rates and, as such, the Business is not exposed to variable interest rate risk.

The objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Business’ ability to continue as a going
concern and provide returns to its owners.

Financial risks are managed, on an on-going basis, by Ardagh’s central Group Treasury and senior
management team. Ardagh does not permit the use of treasury instruments for speculative purposes,
under any circumstances. Ardagh Group Treasury regularly reviews the level of cash and debt facilities
required to fund the activities of the Business, repayments and financing of related party debt obligations,
and identified an appropriate amount of headroom to provide a reserve against unexpected funding
requirements.

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**16. Financial risk factors (Continued)**

**Currency exchange risk**

The Business presents its combined financial information in U.S. dollar.

The Business operates in 20 countries, across four continents and its main currency exposure in the
year to December 31, 2018, from the euro functional currency, was in relation to the U.S. dollar, British
pound, Polish zloty and Danish krone. Currency exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions
and recognized assets and liabilities.

As a result of the combined financial statements being presented in U.S dollar, the results of the
Business are also impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the euro.

The Business has a limited level of transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by
operating units in currencies other than their functional currencies.

Fluctuations in the value of these currencies with respect to the euro currency may have a significant
impact on the Business’ financial condition and results of operations. The Business believes that a
strengthening of the euro exchange rate by 1% against all other foreign currencies from the December 31,
2018 rate would decrease invested capital by approximately $5 million (2017: $5 million, 2016: $5 million,
2015: $6 million).

**Commodity price risk**

The Business is exposed to changes in prices of its main raw materials, primarily energy, aluminum
and steel. Aluminum ingot is traded daily as a commodity on the London Metal Exchange, which has
historically been subject to significant price volatility. Because aluminum is priced in U.S. dollar,
fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/euro rate also affect the euro cost of aluminum ingot. The price and foreign
currency risk on the aluminum purchases in the operations are hedged by entering into swaps under which
we pay fixed euro prices. In contrast, the hedging market for steel, and in particular that for coking coal, is
a relatively new market which does not have the depth of the aluminum market and as a consequence,
there might be limitations to placing hedges in the market. The majority of the steel purchases of the
Business are obtained under one-year contracts with prices that are usually fixed in advance. When such
contracts are renewed in the future, our steel costs under such contracts will be subject to prevailing global
steel and/or tinplate prices at the time of renewal, which may be different from historical prices.
Furthermore, the relative price of oil and its by-products may materially impact our business, affecting our
transport, lacquer and ink costs.

The Business uses derivative agreements to manage some of the material cost risk. The Business
depends on an active liquid market and available credit lines with counterparty banks to cover this risk.
The use of derivative contracts to manage its risk is dependent on robust hedging procedures. Increasing
raw material costs over time has the potential, if we are unable to pass on price increases, to reduce sales
volume and could therefore have a significant impact on its financial condition. The Business is also
exposed to possible interruptions of supply of aluminum and steel or other raw materials and any inability
to purchase raw materials could negatively impact its operations.

As a result of the volatility of gas and electricity prices, the Business has either included energy
pass-through clauses in its sales contracts or developed an active hedging strategy to fix a significant
proportion of its energy costs through contractual arrangements directly with our suppliers, where there is
no energy clause in the sales contract.

F-61


-----

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**16. Financial risk factors (Continued)**

Where pass through contracts do not exist, the Business policy is to purchase gas and electricity by
entering into forward price-fixing arrangements with suppliers for the bulk of our anticipated requirements
for the year ahead. Such contracts are used exclusively to obtain delivery of our anticipated energy
supplies. The Business does not net settle, nor do we sell within a short period of time after taking delivery.
The Business avails of the own use exemption and, therefore, these contracts are treated as executory
contracts.

The Business typically builds up these contractual positions in tranches of approximately 10% of the
anticipated volumes. Any gas and electricity which is not purchased under forward price-fixing
arrangements is purchased under index tracking contracts or at spot prices.

**Credit risk**

Credit risk of the Business has been managed by Ardagh’s central Treasury function. Credit risk arises
from derivative contracts, cash and deposits held with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit
exposures to the customers of the Business, including outstanding receivables. The policy of the Business is
to place excess liquidity on deposit with the central Ardagh Treasury entity who will, in turn, only place
excess liquid funds with recognized and reputable financial institutions. For banks and financial
institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘‘BBB+’’ from at least two credit
rating agencies are accepted, where possible. The credit ratings of banks and financial institutions are
monitored to ensure compliance with Ardagh Group policy. Risk of default is controlled within a policy
framework of dealing with high quality institutions and by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any
one bank or institution.

Business policy is to extend credit to customers of good credit standing. Credit risk is managed on an
on-going basis, by experienced people within the Business. The Business’ policy for the management of
credit risk in relation to trade receivables involves periodically assessing the financial reliability of
customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Provisions are
made, where deemed necessary, and the utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. The Business
does not expect any significant counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The maximum exposure to
credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the
ten largest customers of the Business accounted for approximately 35% of total revenues (2017: 39%;
2016: 40%). There is no recent history of default with these customers.

**Liquidity risk**

The Business is exposed to liquidity risk which arises primarily from the maturing of short term and
long term debt obligations. Ardagh’s policy has been to ensure that sufficient resources are available either
from cash balances, cash flows or undrawn committed bank facilities, to ensure all obligations can be met
as they fall due.

To effectively manage liquidity risk Ardagh:

   - has committed borrowing facilities that it can access to meet liquidity needs;

   - maintains cash balances and liquid investments with highly-rated counterparties;

   - limits the maturity of cash balances;

   - borrows the bulk of its debt needs under long term fixed rate debt securities; and

F-62


-----

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**16. Financial risk factors (Continued)**

   - has internal control processes to manage liquidity risk.

Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the Ardagh and is aggregated by
Ardagh Group Treasury. Ardagh Group Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of Ardagh’s liquidity
requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient
headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the Ardagh does not breach
borrowing limits or covenants on any of its borrowing facilities. Such forecasting takes into consideration
the Ardagh’s debt financing plans.

The increase in total borrowings primarily relates to a loan of $109 million transferred into the
Business (2017: $nil, 2016: $nil), partly offset by a foreign exchange gain of $16 million (2017: $41 million
loss, 2016: $9 million gain) and other movements through invested capital of $31 million (2017:
$10 million, 2016: $10 million).

The Business uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial
instruments:

Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); and
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.

Fair values are calculated as follows:

(i) Non-current related party borrowings—The fair value of the non-current related party
borrowings of the Business is linked to quoted market prices for Ardagh’s corporate debt,
considering the credit risk of the Business and represent Level 2 inputs.

(ii) Current related party borrowings—The fair value of the current related party borrowings are
equivalent to their carrying value, given these related party borrowings are short-term in nature.

(iii) Finance leases and other borrowings—The carrying amount of finance leases and other
borrowings is assumed to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.

(iv) Metal forward contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts—The fair value of these
derivatives are based on quoted market prices and represent Level 2 inputs.

$5 million (2017: $nil, 2016: $nil, 2015: $4 million) are classified as current liabilities in the combined
statement of financial position at December 31, 2018.

The majority of derivative assets and liabilities mature within one year with the exception of certain
metal forward contracts which mature at dates between January 2020 and October 2021. All cash payments
in relation to derivative instruments are paid or received when they mature.

The Business mitigates the counterparty risk for derivatives by contracting with major financial
institutions which have high credit ratings.

**Metal forward contracts**

The Business hedges a portion of its anticipated metal purchases. Excluding conversion and freight
costs, the physical metal deliveries are priced based on the applicable indices agreed with the suppliers for
the relevant month.

Fair values have been based on quoted market prices and are valued using Level 2 valuation inputs.
The fair value of these contracts when initiated is $nil; no premium is paid or received.

**Forward foreign exchange contracts**

The Business operates in a number of currencies and, accordingly, hedges a portion of its currency
transaction risk. The fair values are based on Level 2 valuation techniques and observable inputs including
the contract prices. The fair value of these contracts when initiated is $nil; no premium is paid or received.

**18. Employee benefit obligations**

The Business operates defined benefit or defined contribution pension schemes in most of its
countries of operation and the assets are held in separately administered funds. The principal funded
defined benefit schemes, which are funded by contributions to separately administered funds, are in the
United Kingdom.

Other defined benefit schemes are unfunded and the provision is recognized in the combined
statement of financial position. The principal unfunded schemes are in Germany.

The contribution rates to the funded plans are agreed with the Trustee boards, plan actuaries and the
local pension regulators periodically. The contributions paid in each period were those recommended by
the actuaries.

In addition, the Business has other employee benefit obligations in certain territories.

Total employee obligations recognized in the combined statement of financial position of $302 million
(2017: $329 million; 2016: $315 million; 2015: $277 million) includes other employee benefit obligations of
$34 million (2017: $34 million; 2016: $31 million; 2015: $34 million). Total employee obligations recognized
in the combined statement of financial position are gross of deferred income tax assets of $45 million in
2018 (2017: $55 million; 2016: $58 million; 2015: $48 million).

The defined benefit obligations above include $245 million (2017: $270 million: 2016: $246 million;
2015: $216 million) of unfunded obligations. Employer contributions above include no contributions under
schemes extinguished during the year (2017: $7 million; 2016: $nil; 2015: $nil).

Interest income and interest cost above does not include interest cost of $nil (2017: $nil; 2016:
$1 million; 2015: $nil) relating to other employee benefit obligations. Current service costs above does not
include current service costs of $1 million (2017: $1 million, 2016: $1 million, 2015: $1 million) relating to
other employee benefit obligations.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Business elected to re-design one of its pension
schemes in Germany, moving from a defined benefit pension scheme to a contribution orientated system.
This amendment resulted in the recognition of a past service credit of $12 million in the year within cost of
sales. The past service credit was partly offset by a past service cost of $3 million following a high court
judgement in the U.K. in October 2018 guaranteeing gender equality in U.K. pension schemes for accrued
benefits (‘‘GMP Equalization’’). The GMP equalization past service cost has been recognized as
exceptional within the combined income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2017 a defined benefit pension scheme in the Netherlands was
transferred to a multi-employer scheme. Prior to the date of transfer, a past service credit of $10 million
was recognized such that, on the date of transfer, the defined benefit obligation and asset were both
$602 million (December 31, 2016: $552 million and $541 million respectively). The Business has taken the
exemption under IAS 19(R) to account for multi-employer schemes as defined contribution schemes. As a
result, the scheme is no longer accounted for as a defined benefit scheme at December 31, 2017.

The pension assets do not include any of the Company’s ordinary shares, other securities or other
Business assets.

**Investment strategy**

The choice of investments takes account of the expected maturity of the future benefit payments. The
plans invest in diversified portfolios consisting of an array of asset classes that attempt to maximize returns
while minimizing volatility. The asset classes include national and international equities, fixed income
government and non-government securities and real estate, as well as cash.

**Characteristics and associated risks**

The U.K. pension plan is a trust-based U.K. funded final salary defined benefit scheme, providing
pensions and lump sum benefits to members and dependents. The U.K. plan has been closed to future
accrual from July 1, 2014, with pensions calculated based on service to the point of closure, but with
members’ benefits retaining a final salary link while employed by the Company.

The pension plans in Germany operate under the framework of German Company Pension Law
(BetrAVG) and general regulations based on German Labor Law. The entitlements of the plan members
depend on years of service and final salary. Furthermore, the plans provide lifelong pensions. No separate
assets are held in trust, i.e. the plans are unfunded defined benefit plans. During the year ended
December 31, 2018, the Business elected to re-design its pension scheme in Germany, moving to a
contribution orientated system.

The U.K. pension plan is governed by a board of trustees, which includes members who are
independent of the Company. The trustees are responsible for managing the operation, funding and
investment strategy. The U.K. pension plan is subject to the U.K. regulatory framework, the requirements
of the Pensions Regulator and is subject to a statutory funding objective.

**Assumptions and sensitivities**

The principal pension assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements take account of
the different economic circumstances in the countries of operations and the different characteristics of the
respective plans, including the duration of the obligations. The ranges of the principal assumptions applied
in estimating defined benefit obligations were:

**Germany** **UK** **Netherlands**

Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are based on actuarial advice in accordance with
published statistics and experience.

These assumptions translate into the following average life expectancy in years for a pensioner retiring
at age 65. The mortality assumptions for the countries with the most significant defined benefit plans are
set out below:

**Germany** **UK** **Netherlands**
**2018** **2017** **2016** **2015** **2018** **2017** **2016** **2015** **2018** **2017** **2016** **2015**
**Years Years Years Years Years Years Years Years Years Years Years Years**

Life expectancy, current pensioners . 22 21 21 21 21 21 21 20 24 24 24 24
Life expectancy, future pensioners . . 24 24 24 24 22 23 22 22 25 25 25 26

If the discount rate were to decrease by 50 basis points from management estimates, the carrying
amount of the pension obligations would increase by an estimated $30 million (2017: $28 million, 2016:
$80 million; 2015: $72 million). If the discount rate were to increase by 50 basis points, the carrying amount
of the pension obligations would decrease by an estimated $27 million (2017: $44 million, 2016:
$87 million; 2015: $80 million).

If the inflation rate were to decrease by 50 basis points from management estimates, the carrying
amount of the pension obligations would decrease by an estimated $20 million (2017: $24 million, 2016:
$24 million; 2015: $37 million). If the inflation rate were to increase by 50 basis points, the carrying amount
of the pension obligations would increase by an estimated $22 million (2017: $25 million, 2016: $26 million;
2015: $19 million).

If the salary increase rate were to decrease by 50 basis points from management estimates, the
carrying amount of the pension obligations would decrease by an estimated $11 million (2017: $14 million,
2016: $15 million; 2015: $27 million). If the salary increase rate were to increase by 50 basis points, the
carrying amount of the pension obligations would increase by an estimated $12 million (2017: $14 million,
2016: $16 million; 2015: $8 million).

The impact of increasing the life expectancy by one year would result in an increase in the net pension
obligation of the Business of $13 million at December 31, 2018 (2017: $14 million, 2016: $35 million; 2015:
$20 million), holding all other assumptions constant.

The best estimate of contributions expected to be paid to defined benefit schemes of the Business in
2019 is $4 million.

(i) Key management compensation

Key management are those persons who have the authority and responsibility for planning, directing
and controlling the activities of the Business. During the financial periods reported in these combined
financial statements, the Business was part of Ardagh Group S.A., which is where all decisions, control and
key strategy choices were made. Therefore the Business does not have any key management as a standalone entity. The finance management of the Business have an operative role in relation to the decisions
taken at corporate level.

The key management personnel of Ardagh have controlled and directed the operations of the
Business as it was not managed separately. Payments to these personnel are made by a different subsidiary
of the Ardagh Group. It is not possible to determine with certainty the charges that the Business received
for the mentioned key personnel, although a portion of the key management remuneration is included in
the corporate costs allocated (note 2).

**THE METAL FOOD & SPECIALITIES BUSINESS**

**NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**

**23. Related party information (Continued)**

A number of the above legal entities act as subsidiary guarantor for the debt of Ardagh Group S.A. as
of December 31, 2018.

**24. Contingencies**

**Environmental issues**

The Business is regulated under various national and local environmental, occupational health and
safety and other governmental laws and regulations relating to:

  - the operation of installations for manufacturing of metal packaging and surface treatment using
solvents;

   - the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials;

  - the emission of substances and physical agents into the environment;

   - the discharge of waste water and disposal of waste;

  - the remediation of contamination;

   - the design, characteristics, collection and recycling of its packaging products; and

  - the manufacturing, sale and servicing of machinery and equipment for the container metal
packaging industry.

The Business believes, based on current information that it is in substantial compliance with
applicable environmental laws and regulations and permit requirements. It does not believe it will be
required, under existing or anticipated future environmental laws and regulations, to expend amounts, over
and above the amounts accrued, which will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or
results of operations or cash flows. In addition, no material proceedings against the Business arising under
environmental laws are pending.

**Legal matter**

In 2015, the German competition authority (the Federal Cartel Office) initiated an investigation of
the practices in Germany of metal packaging manufacturers, including Ardagh. In 2018, the European
Commission took over this investigation and the German investigation is, as a result, at an end. The
European Commission’s investigation is ongoing, and there is at this stage no certainty as to the extent of
any charge which may arise. Accordingly, no provision has been recognized.

With the exception of the above legal matter, the Business is involved in certain other legal
proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. The Business believes that none of these
proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on its
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**25. Events after the reporting period**

There are no material events after the reporting period relevant to the Business which would require
disclosure in these combined financial statements.

**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (Unaudited)**

**(in thousands)**

**1. Organization and Basis of Presentation**

**_Formation of Company_**

Element Holdings II, L.P. (the Company) was formed on February 18, 2010, and on April 1, 2010, it
acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Element US Holding Company and Element
Netherlands Holdings Company.

**_Nature of Business_**

The Company is primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling extruded aluminum
containers to fit the specifications of customers in various industries in domestic and international markets.
In conducting this business, the Company leverages its technical capabilities to innovate new designs
allowing customers to enhance their brand and provide optimal functionality primarily in the aerosol,
beverage and food markets. The Company does business primarily in the United States, Brazil, and
Argentina, and maintains holding companies in the Netherlands.

**_Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation_**

Element Holdings II, L.P. and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as ‘‘the Company’’ or
‘‘Exal Group’’. The Condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Condensed consolidated interim financial statements
have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated for all periods presented.

The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company,
without audit. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(‘‘U.S. GAAP’’) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the
Company believes that the disclosures included are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading.

In management’s opinion, the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet
as at March 31, 2019, the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Changes in Partners’ Equity for the three
months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the
three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, contained herein, reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of
normal recurring items, which are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position,
results of operations and cash flows on a basis consistent with that of the Company’s prior audited
consolidated financial statements. However, the results of operations for the interim periods may not be
indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year. Therefore, these financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto and summary of significant
accounting policies included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements the year ended
December 31, 2018. Except as noted below, there have been no material changes in the footnotes from
those accompanying the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**2. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements**

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued ASU 2016-15, Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230)—Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15
clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows
and amends certain disclosure requirements of ASC 230. The guidance will generally be applied
retrospectively and is effective for non-public business entities for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not result in
any change to the classification or presentation in the statement of cash flows in any current or prior
period.

In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ‘‘Reporting Comprehensive Income’’. This ASU gives
entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act
related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. This ASU may be
applied retrospectively to each period in the year of adoption. This ASU also requires new disclosures
regarding our accounting policy for relating the tax effects in AOCI. The standard is applicable for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 did not have impact to the
Company’s financial statements.

**3. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted**

In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09,
‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’. In addition to superseding and replacing nearly all existing
U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, ASC 606 establishes a new
control-based revenue recognition model; changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over
time or at a point in time; provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics; and expands and
improves disclosures about revenue. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue
when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need
to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the present guidance. In achieving the core
principle, an entity should apply the five-step revenue recognition model as described in the standard.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of
the Effective Date’’, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. As such,
the Company will be required to apply the new revenue recognition standard for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019.

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal
versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09
on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction, which impacts whether an
entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.

In April 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-10, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance
obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property (IP).

In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-12, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on collectability, non-cash

consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. These amendments are intended to address
implementation issues and provide additional practical expedients.

The Company has not early adopted the new revenue standard and will adopt the standard effective
for the annual fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and for the interim periods in the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2020. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact that the adoption of these revenue
standards will have on the measurement, recognition and disclosure of revenue in the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ‘‘Leases’’. The new standard applies a
right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than
12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments.
Similar to the existing standard, the lessee will classify leases as either finance or operating. This
classification will involve more judgement on the part of the lessee. The pattern of expense recognition in
the income statement as well the effect on the statement of cash flows differs depending on the lease
classification.

Lessor accounting is similar to the current lease standard; however, updated to align with changes to
the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Similar to current leases standard, lessors will
classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type.

Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable
users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from
leases.

The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The standard must be adopted using a modified
retrospective transition. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard.

**4. Property, Plant and Equipment**

Machinery and equipment purchases of $2,952 and $3,206 were included in accounts payable at
March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively

**5. Financing Arrangements**

Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:

**March 31,** **December 31,**

**5. Financing Arrangements (Continued)**

At March 31, 2019, the Company had unused revolving lines of credit of $31,200 and $2,000 for Exal
Corporation and Exal Argentina, S.A., respectively, under its credit facility.

The restrictive financial covenants contained within the Company’s credit facility are a fixed charge
coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of its credit facility
as of March 31, 2019.

**6. Commitments and Contingencies**

The Exal Group is a defendant in legal actions from normal business activities. At March 31, 2019,
management believes that these matters are without merit and the likelihood of loss is remote. The
ultimate liability, if any, upon resolution will not have a material effect on the Condensed consolidated
interim financial position, operations or cash flows of the Company.

In an attempt to fix the cost of aluminum at a lower level, Exal Corporation (‘‘Exal U.S.’’), the
Company’s North American subsidiary, committed itself on a short-term basis to purchase specified
quantities of aluminum slugs at fixed prices from one supplier during 2018 and 2019. These contracts meet
the normal purchases and normal sales provision and are therefore not subject to be accounted for as
derivatives under ASC 815. For the years 2019 and 2018, these commitments totaled 2,017 and 2,913
metric tons of aluminum for $5,707 and $6,510, respectively

**7. Other Expenses**

Other expense consisted of the following for the three months ended March 31:

**2019** **2018**

Foreign currency remeasurement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **$3,609** $1,650

Total other expenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **$4,385** $3,159

**8. Insurance Recoveries**

_Garin, Argentina Fire_

In October 2017, a fire occurred at the Company’s packaging facility in Garin, Argentina. The fire
took place in the warehousing area of the plant and no production assets were damaged. During the fourth
quarter of 2017 and into early 2018, the packaging facility was not able to operate at full capacity as the
initial cleanup activities impacted the entire facility. The Company maintains property insurance with a
deductible of $80 coverage to mitigate losses.

the fire.

The Company incurred demolition, cleanup, repair and other fire related costs of $0 and $1,131 for

statements or notes thereto.

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Board of Directors and Partners of Element Holdings II, L.P. (dba Exal Group)

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Element Holdings II, L.P. and
Subsidiaries (dba Exal Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018
and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in
partners’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditors’ Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Element Holdings II, L.P. and Subsidiaries (dba Exal
Group) as at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

**1. Organization and Basis of Presentation**

**_Formation of Company_**

Element Holdings II, L.P. (the Company) was formed on February 18, 2010, and on April 1, 2010, it
acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Element US Holding Company and Element
Netherlands Holdings Company.

**_Nature of Business_**

The Company is primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling extruded aluminum
containers to fit the specifications of customers in various industries in domestic and international markets.
In conducting this business, the Company leverages its technical capabilities to innovate new designs
allowing customers to enhance their brand and provide optimal functionality primarily in the aerosol,
beverage and food markets. The Company does business primarily in the United States, Brazil, and
Argentina, and maintains holding companies in the Netherlands.

**_Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation_**

Element Holdings II, L.P. and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as ‘‘the Company’’ or
‘‘Exal Group’’. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Intercompany balances and
transactions are eliminated for all periods presented.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

A summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows:

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to changes in facts and circumstances.

On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the accounts
receivable allowance, reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, lower of cost or market conditions, useful
lives of long-lived assets (including intangible assets), carrying value of long-lived assets (including goodwill
and intangible assets), and the valuation of deferred income tax assets, as well as its assumptions to value
its workers’ compensation liabilities, the value of unit option plans and other related assumptions used for
the purpose of determining stock-based compensation, among other things. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

**For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017**

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred,
price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Customers generally take
title and assume all the risks of ownership upon shipment.

**_Shipping and Handling Costs_**

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded as revenues and the related costs are
included as a component of cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

The Company considers highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturity dates of three
months or less from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents and are valued at cost plus accrued
interest, which approximates fair value.

**_Receivables_**

The Company has established credit policies in evaluating its customers’ financial condition and,
generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The potential risk is limited to the amounts recorded
in the consolidated financial statements. Periodically, management reviews accounts receivable and adjusts
the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s historical losses, existing economic conditions
and the financial stability of its customers. Receivables are written off when they are determined to be
uncollectible, although collection efforts may continue. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts
was $369 and $572 at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method) or
net realizable value. The cost of work in process and finished goods includes materials, labor, and an
allocation of fixed overhead based on normal operating capacity. Provisions are made for potentially
obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on management’s analysis of inventory levels, historical usage,
future demand and market conditions.

**_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line
method. Major property categories are depreciated over various periods as follows (in years):

**Description** **Useful life**

Land improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 - 40

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**

**For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017**

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

The Company capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property and equipment.
The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over
the asset’s estimated useful life.

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360, Property, Plant and
Equipment, the Company regularly assesses the carrying value of its long-lived assets to be held and used,
including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If such events or circumstances are
present, a loss is recognized to the extent the carrying values of the asset are in excess of estimated fair
value. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $5,596 during the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily related to certain manufacturing assets that had been previously taken out of service. No
impairment loss was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.

**_Intangible Assets_**

Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships. The useful lives of intangible assets are
estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset. Amortization is provided using the straight-line
method over a useful life of 15 years.

**_Contingencies_**

From time-to-time during the ordinary course of business, the Company is threatened with, or may
become a party to, legal actions and other proceedings. The Company records a liability for such claims
when an unfavorable outcome of the matter is deemed to be probable and the amount of the loss is
reasonably estimable. Legal costs associated with these contingencies are recorded as incurred.

**_Income Taxes_**

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for
income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable
(or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred
taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the
Company’s assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when
changes are enacted.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a
tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all
potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of
taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as
well as all available positive and negative evidence.

Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are
recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are
recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that either the appropriate taxing

authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open, or the
statute of limitation has expired. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as
part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and
penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are
recognized.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

The Company accounts for the fair value measurement of its financial assets and liabilities in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 820, which defines fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.

FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, prioritizing observable and unobservable inputs used
to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:

   - Level 1—quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are
accessible at the measurement date;

  - Level 2—inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly; and

   - Level 3—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement.

**_Stock-Based Compensation_**

The Company’s Parent has a stock option plan with the Company’s management, employees and
independent directors, and the related stock-based compensation is reported as part of selling, general and
administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income. The fair value associated with unit option plans has been calculated using the Black-Scholes
valuation model and is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period.

**_Foreign Currency Translation_**

The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company’s
foreign subsidiary operates, except in countries with a history of high inflation. Management selects the
functional currency after evaluating the economic operating environment of its foreign subsidiaries. The
Company’s operations in Argentina and Brazil use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. All other
foreign entities use the local currency as the functional currency.

a monthly basis throughout the year. Foreign currency transaction losses included in other expense totaled
$18,815 and $5,496 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations where the local currency is the functional currency are
translated using period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average
exchange rates on a monthly basis throughout the year. Translation gains and losses are reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income in partners’ equity. The Company’s foreign
currency translation gain for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $303. The Company’s foreign currency
translation loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $823.

**_Short-term Purchase Commitments_**

In an attempt to fix the cost of aluminum at a lower level, Exal Corporation (‘‘Exal U.S.’’), the
Company’s North American subsidiary, committed itself on a short-term basis to purchase specified
quantities of aluminum slugs at fixed prices from one supplier during 2018 and 2019. These contracts meet
the normal purchases and normal sales provision and are therefore not subject to be accounted for as
derivatives under ASC 815. For the years 2019 and 2018, these commitments totaled 2,017 and 2,913
metric tons of aluminum for $5,707 and $6,510, respectively

**_Non-cash Investing Activities_**

Machinery and equipment purchases of $3,206 and $3,431 were included in accounts payable at
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

**_Advertising Costs_**

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Charges to operations amounted to $211 and $169 for
2018 and 2017, respectively.

**_Reclassifications_**

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. Such
reclassifications had no effect on the accumulated deficit.

**_Research and Development_**

Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Substantially all engineering and
development costs are related to developing new products or designing significant improvements to
existing products or processes. Costs primarily include salaries and benefits, facility costs and outside
services.

**_New accounting policies adopted by the Company_**

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, ‘‘Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities’’. The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other changes, the

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at
amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities. For non-public entities, the guidance is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting
(‘‘ASU 2016-09’’). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based
payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, though early adoption is permitted if all amendments are adopted in the same period. On January 1,
2018, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in the
Company making an accounting policy election to change how it will recognize the number of share-based
payments that will ultimately vest. In the past, the Company applied a forfeiture rate to shares granted.
With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company will recognize forfeitures as they occur. The adoption of
ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting (‘‘ASU 2017-09’’). ASU 2017-09 clarifies
when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as
modifications. The guidance also clarifies that a modification to an award could be significant and
therefore require disclosure, even if modification accounting is not required. ASU 2017-09 is effective for
annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. On
January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the provision of ASU 2017-09 on a prospective basis. The adoption
of ASU 2017-09 did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted_**

In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09,
‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’. In addition to superseding and replacing nearly all existing
U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, ASC 606 establishes a new
control-based revenue recognition model; changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over
time or at a point in time; provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics; and expands and
improves disclosures about revenue. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue
when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need
to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the present guidance. In achieving the core
principle, an entity should apply the five-step revenue recognition model as described in the standard.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of
the Effective Date’’, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. As such,
the Company will be required to apply the new revenue recognition standard for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019.

In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal
versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09
on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction, which impacts whether an
entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.

In April 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-10, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance
obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property (IP).

In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-12, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on collectability, non-cash
consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. These amendments are intended to address
implementation issues and provide additional practical expedients.

The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of these revenue standards will have on the
measurement, recognition and disclosure of revenue in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ‘‘Leases’’. The new standard applies a
right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than
12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments.
Similar to the existing standard, the lessee will classify leases as either finance or operating. This
classification will involve more judgement on the part of the lessee. The pattern of expense recognition in
the income statement as well the effect on the statement of cash flows differs depending on the lease
classification.

Lessor accounting is similar to the current lease standard; however, updated to align with changes to
the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Similar to current leases standard, lessors will
classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type.

Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable
users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from
leases.

The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The standard must be adopted using a modified
retrospective transition. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, ‘‘Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments’’. This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow items with the objective of reducing diversity in
practice and clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash
payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance will generally be applied

retrospectively and is effective for non-public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new
standard.

In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ‘‘Reporting Comprehensive Income’’. This ASU gives
entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act
related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. This ASU may be
applied retrospectively to each period in the year of adoption. This ASU will also require new disclosures
regarding our accounting policy for relating the tax effects in AOCI. The standard is applicable for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this
new standard.

During 2018, the Company continued to hold three manufacturing lines that had been taken out of
service as it continued to assess their future disposition. At December 31, 2018, the manufacturing lines,
which had a carrying value of $10,977, were tested for recoverability in accordance with the FASB’s ASC
Topic 360. The Company determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient
to support the carrying value of the assets, and an impairment charge of $5,596 was recognized to write the
assets down to their estimated fair value of $5,381. The estimate of fair value was based on non-recurring,
Level 3 fair value measures that were estimated through appraisal considering the cost and market
approaches to value personal property.

**7. Investments Accounted for Using the Equity Method (Continued)**

shareholder in Casablanca is a related party to Exal Group. Casablanca is a variable interest entity (VIE);
however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary. The variable interest in the
VIE is primarily related to subordinated financial support. Although this financial arrangement resulted in
the Company holding variable interests in this entity, it does not empower the Company to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Company further
determined that the related party is most closely associated with the VIE. Accordingly, Casablanca is not
consolidated and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting with the investment having been
recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company’s proportionate share of Casablanca’s undistributed
earnings or losses. The Company’s investment in Casablanca totaled $1,384 and $1,545 as of December 31,
2018 and 2017, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

**8. Financing Arrangements**

Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:

On March 3, 2017, the Company refinanced all of its debt, including its related party debt which was
repaid on this date, and replaced it with a new long-term debt (the ‘‘Credit Facility’’) expiring on March 3,
2022. The Credit Facility comprised of $170,000 of term loans and $55,000 of revolving line of credit,
$50,000 of which is available to Exal Corporation and $5,000 of which is available to Exal Argentina, S.A.
The Credit Facility is secured by the Company’s various interests in common stock and assets of Exal
Corporation, Exal Packaging S.A., Exal Argentina S.A., Exal Madryn S.A., and Exal Holdings Brazil. The
restrictive financial covenants contained within the 2017 Credit Facility are a fixed coverage charge ratio
and a leverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility as of
December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had unused revolving lines of credit of $31,100 and $1,000 for
Exal Corporation and Exal Argentina, S.A., respectively, under the Credit Facility. Borrowings on
revolving lines of credit carry interest rates based upon adjusted LIBOR or prime rates and other
adjustments associated with the financial covenants. The Company pays a monthly commitment fee equal
to 0.50% per year on the undrawn portion of the revolving lines of credit.

recorded fees of $1,651 related to securing the new revolving credit facility as an unamortized asset, and
fees related to the term loans of $5,125 as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt upon
issuance. The financing fees are amortized into interest expense in the consolidated financial statements
over the life of the Credit Facility and totaled $1,501 and $1,994 for the years ended December 31, 2018
and 2017, respectively.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had no outstanding letters of credit.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign

No provision has been made for income taxes on the portion of unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently reinvested in those jurisdictions.

The Company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740 and has determined
that all income tax filing positions would be sustained upon examination and has not recorded any reserves
or related accruals for interest and penalties at December 31, 2018 and 2017 for uncertain tax positions.

Exal Madryn, S.A. and Exal India, B.V. have no undistributed net income due to these entities not
having been profitable historically.

Total benefit (provision) for income taxes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **$** **550** $ (447)

On December 22, 2017, a comprehensive U.S. tax reform bill originally known as the ‘‘Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act’’ was enacted into law. The Company’s 2017 consolidated financial statements included a
one-time benefit to net income of approximately $8,500 to reflect the remeasurement of the Company’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate which was reduced
from 35% to 21%.

The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from the Company’s estimates, possibly
materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made by the Company as well as
additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax
Reform Legislation.

The Company’s reported income tax expense differs from the statutory federal income tax rate
primarily due to state and local taxes (net of federal benefit), non-deductible operating expenses, the
domestic production activity deduction and the impact of foreign operations with tax rates different than
the statutory federal income tax rate.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had approximately $34,826 and $40,758, respectively,
of net operating loss carryforwards, some of which may be carried forward indefinitely and the remainder
of which expire in various years. These net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset a portion of
future taxable income and, thereby, reduce or eliminate the foreign income taxes otherwise payable.

At December 31, 2017, the Company maintained a valuation allowance totaling $4,772 against tax loss
carryforwards at its Madryn, Argentina business. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company
merged its Madryn, Argentina and Pilar, Argentina businesses, which allowed for the utilization of these
tax loss carryforwards beginning in the 2018 tax year. Based on this evidence, the Company fully reversed
this valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2018.

**12. Commitments and Contingencies**

The Exal Group is a defendant in legal actions from normal business activities. At December 31, 2018,
management believes that these matters are without merit and the likelihood of loss is remote. The
ultimate liability, if any, upon resolution will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial
position, operations or cash flows of the Company.

**13. Stock-Based Compensation**

The Company has unit option plans under which options to purchase units of its Parent have been
granted to directors and key employees at the market value of the units at the date of grant. Payment must

These options cannot be traded in any equity market. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
options granted in 2018 and 2017 have estimated fair values at the date of grant of $6.05 and $4.04 to $4.98
per unit, respectively. The actual value an employee may realize will depend on the excess of the unit price
on the date the option is exercised over the exercise price. Consequently, there is no assurance that the
value realized by an employee will be at or near the value estimated on the grant date.

The fair values were estimated using the following assumptions for options granted in:

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Board of Directors and Partners of Element Holdings II, L.P. (dba Exal Group)

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Element Holdings II, L.P. and
Subsidiaries (dba Exal Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017
and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in
partners’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design,
implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditors’ Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Element Holdings II, L.P. and Subsidiaries (dba Exal
Group) as at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

**Element Holdings II, L.P. and Subsidiaries**

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**

**For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016**

**(In Thousands)**

**1. Organization and Basis of Presentation**

**_Formation of Company_**

Element Holdings II, L.P. (the Company) was formed on February 18, 2010, and on April 1, 2010, it
acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of Element US Holding Company and Element
Netherlands Holdings Company.

**_Nature of Business_**

The Company is primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling extruded aluminum
containers to fit the specifications of customers in various industries in domestic and international markets.
In conducting this business, the Company leverages its technical capabilities to innovate new designs
allowing customers to enhance,m their brand and provide optimal functionality primarily in the aerosol,
beverage and food markets. The Company does business primarily in North and South America.

**_Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. The subsidiaries of those entities included Exal Corporation, Boxal Suisse, S.A., Exal
Argentina, S.A. and Exal Packaging, S.A. The entities formed or acquired subsequent to this transaction
include Exal Holding Brazil, Exal Madryn S.A., Exal Holdings International Parent B.V., Exal Holdings
International B.V. and Exal India B.V. The results of acquired entities’ operations have been included in
the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Element Holdings II, L.P. and its
subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the Company or Exal Group. The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated for all periods
presented.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**

A summary of the significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows:

**_Use of Estimates_**

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates due to changes in facts and circumstances.

On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to the accounts
receivable allowance, reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, lower of cost or market conditions, useful
lives of long-lived assets (including intangible assets), carrying value of long-lived assets (including goodwill
and intangible assets), and the valuation of deferred income tax assets, as well as its assumptions to value
its workers’ compensation liabilities, post-retirement obligations, the value of unit option plans and other

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

related assumptions used for the purpose of determining stock-based compensation, among other things.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred,
price has been fixed or is determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Customers generally take
title and assume all the risks of ownership upon shipment.

**_Shipping and Handling Costs_**

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded as revenues and the related costs are
included as a component of cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

The Company considers highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturity dates of three
months or less from the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents and are valued at cost plus accrued
interest, which approximates fair value.

**_Receivables_**

The Company has established credit policies in evaluating its customers’ financial condition and,
generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The potential risk is limited to the amounts recorded
in the consolidated financial statements. Periodically, management reviews accounts receivable and adjusts
the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s historical losses, existing economic conditions
and the financial stability of its customers. Receivables are written off when they are determined to be
uncollectible, although collection efforts may continue. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts
was $572 and $697 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method) or
net realizable value. Provisions are made for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory based on
management’s analysis of inventory levels, historical usage, future demand and market conditions.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

**_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line
method. Major property categories are depreciated over various periods as follows (in years):

**Description** **Years**

Land improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 - 40

The Company capitalizes interest cost incurred on funds used to construct property and equipment.
The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over
the asset’s estimated useful life.

In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360, Property, Plant and
Equipment, the Company regularly assesses the carrying value of its long-lived assets to be held and used,
including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If such events or circumstances are
present, a loss is recognized to the extent the carrying values of the asset are in excess of estimated fair
value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated financial statements and
reported at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be
depreciated and amortized. The assets and assets of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale would be
presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated financial statements.
The Company determined that no impairment loss needed to be recognized for the applicable assets at
December 31, 2017. An impairment loss of $4,720 was recognized December 31, 2016.

**_Intangible Assets_**

Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships. The useful lives of intangible assets are
estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset. Amortization is provided using the straight-line
method over a useful life of 15 years.

**_Contingencies_**

During the ordinary course of business, the Company is from time to time threatened with, or may
become a party to, legal actions and other proceedings. The Company assesses contingencies as to whether
they are probable and estimable and records its best estimate of the potential loss. Legal costs associated
with these contingencies are recorded as incurred.

**_Income Taxes_**

The provision for income taxes is determined using the liability approach of accounting for income
taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes result from differences
between the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in

tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax
assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

**_Fair Value Measurements_**

The Company accounts for the fair value measurement of its financial assets and liabilities in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 820, which defines fair value as the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date.

FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, prioritizing observable and unobservable inputs used
to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:

  - Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date
for identical assets or liabilities.

  - Level 2—Observable inputs that are based on prices not quoted on active markets, but
corroborated by market data.

  - Level 3—Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available.

The hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the
measurement date. The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the
lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement.

**_Stock-Based Compensation_**

The Company’s Parent has a stock option plan with the Company’s management, employees and
independent directors, and the related stock-based compensation is reported as part of selling, general and
administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
income. The fair value associated with unit option plans has been calculated using the Black-Scholes
valuation model and is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period.

**_Foreign Currency Translation_**

The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company’s
foreign subsidiary operates. Management selects the functional currency after evaluating the economic
operating environment of its foreign subsidiaries. All foreign entities use the local currency as the
functional currency, except in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in South America), which
use the U.S. dollar.

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, except those in South America, are translated using
period-end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during
each period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as a
component of partners’ equity. The Company’s foreign currency translation loss for the year ended
December 31, 2017 was $823. The Company’s foreign currency translation gain for the year ended
December 31, 2016 was $702. For the foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency,

all foreign currency financial statement amounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency
transaction losses included in other expense totaled $5,496 and $1,408 for the years ended December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively.

**_Short-term Purchase Commitments_**

In an attempt to fix the cost of aluminum at a lower level, Exal Corporation (Exal U.S.), the
Company’s North American subsidiary, has committed itself on a short-term basis to purchase specified
quantities of aluminum slugs from one supplier during 2017 and 2016 at certain fixed prices. These
contracts meet the normal purchases and normal sales provision and are, therefore, not subject to be
accounted for as derivatives under FASB ASC 815. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, these committed
purchases for 2018 and 2017 approximate 2,913 and 2,450 metric tons of aluminum and aggregate $6,510
and $4,634, respectively.

**_Non-cash Investing Activities_**

Machinery and equipment purchases of $3,431 and $3,784 were included in accounts payable at
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

**_Advertising Costs_**

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Charges to operations amounted to $169 and $62 for
2017 and 2016, respectively.

**_Reclassifications_**

The financial statements for 2016 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for 2017. Such
reclassifications had no effect on accumulated deficit.

**_Research and Development_**

Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Substantially all engineering and
development costs are related to developing new products or designing significant improvements to
existing products or processes. Costs primarily include salaries and benefits, facility costs and outside
services.

**_New accounting policies adopted by the Company_**

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-11—Inventory (Topic 330):
Simplifying the measurement of inventory. This update was a part of the simplification initiative and
applies to inventory that is measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. An entity should
measure inventory within the scope of this update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net
realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Other than the change in the subsequent
measurement guidance from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value for

inventory within the scope of this update, there are no other substantive changes to the guidance on
measurement of inventory. For non-public entities, the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016. There was no impact to the Company from the adoption of this update.

In 2016, FASB issued amendments to ASC No. 835 as issued in the ASU 2015-03 and further clarified
through the release of ASU 2015-15. The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs
related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction
from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. Under
ASU 2015-15, it is clarified that due to a lack of authoritative guidance with respect to the presentation of
debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements, such costs continue to be deferred and
presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. This adoption did not
have any impact on the current year consolidated financial statements.

On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation. The
targeted amendments intend to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are
accounted for and presented in the consolidated financial statements.

ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on
share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in
which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation
allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The amendment
also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating
activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

ASU 2016-09 elevates the statutory tax withholding threshold after settlement of a share-based award
to qualify for equity classification up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction. The
cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be
classified as a financing activity.

ASU 2016-09 provides an optional accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards
that are expected to vest, consistent with the existing standard, or account for forfeitures when they occur.
The new standard did not impact the measurement and recognition of stock-based compensation and
related tax impact in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In May 2017, FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of
Modification Accounting. The amendments in this update provide guidance about which changes to the
terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in
Topic 718. The amendments provide guidance on modifications in circumstances where the entity has
determined the change to not be substantive.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all the following are met:

   - The fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is
used) of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before
the original award is modified. If the modifications do not affect any of the inputs to the valuation
technique that the entity uses to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value
immediately before and after the modification.

   - The vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original
award immediately before the original award is modified.

   - The classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same
as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified.

Adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

In 2017, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Simplifying the accounting for measurement period adjustments. The amendments in this update require
that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement
period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this
update require that the acquirer record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of
changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the
provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Adoption
of the ASU did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted_**

In 2016, FASB Subtopic 825-10 as issued in ASU 2016-01 was released. The amendments in this
update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial
instruments. Among other changes, the amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of
financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities. The
standard for non-public business entities is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard.

In 2016, FASB Topic 230 as issued in ASU 2016-15 was released. This update addresses eight specific
cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The new guidance also clarifies how the
predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more
than one class of cash flows. The guidance will generally be applied retrospectively and is effective for
non-public entities beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
adopting this new standard.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09,
which creates a new topic in the ASC: 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606). In
addition to superseding and replacing nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance,
including industry-specific guidance, ASC 606 establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model;
changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time; provides new
and more detailed guidance on specific topics; and expands and improves disclosures about revenue. The
standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in
exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make
more estimates than under the present guidance. In achieving the core principle, an entity should apply the
five-step revenue recognition model as described in the standard.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of
the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. As such, the
Company will be required to apply the new revenue recognition standard for annual reporting periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2019. In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) with amendments to
ASU 2014-09 on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction, which
impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis.

In April 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying
Performance Obligations and Licensing with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance
obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property (IP).

In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope
Improvements and Practical Expedients with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on collectability, non-cash
consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. These amendments are intended to address
implementation issues and provide additional practical expedients.

The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of these revenue standards will have on the
measurement, recognition and disclosure of revenue in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued the new leases standard (Topic 842) which supersedes the
existing standard Topic 840, Leases. The lessees will likely see the most significant change. The new
standard applies a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease
term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to
make lease payments. Similar to the existing standard, the lessee will classify leases as either finance or
operating. This classification will involve more judgement on the part of the lessee. The pattern of expense
recognition in the income statement as well the effect on the statement of cash flows differs depending on
the lease classification.

Lessor accounting is similar to the current leases standard, but updated to align with changes to the
lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Similar to current leases standard, lessors will
classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type.

**2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**

Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable
users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from
leases.

The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual and interim reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The standard must be adopted using a modified
retrospective transition. The Company currently anticipates adopting the standard as of January 1, 2020.
The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on the measurement, recognition and
disclosure of leases in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

**3. Discontinued Operations**

In May 2013, the Company ceased operations at its slug manufacturing plant in Switzerland, Boxal
Suisse. Some of the equipment of the plant was transferred and is being utilized in the Company’s slug
manufacturing plant in Argentina.

There were no assets and liabilities of the discontinued Switzerland operations as of December 31,
2016. During 2016, Boxal Suisse received proceeds of $14 for the sale of property, plant and equipment,
resulting in a loss of $3 for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the 2015 sale of the remaining
property, plant and equipment, a substantial liquidation has occurred under ASC 830 and accordingly all
accumulated currency translations adjustments totaling $275 were reclassified into operations during 2016.
This amount is included in income from operations before taxes in discontinued operations in the
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2016.

**4. Accounts Receivable**

Accounts receivable consisted of the following at December 31:

**2017** **2016**

Trade accounts receivable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **$38,537** $39,849

**$54,242** $53,082

During 2015, the Company entered into a supply chain financing program to sell accounts receivable
from a customer without recourse to a third-party financial institution. Sales of accounts receivable are
reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds of
$21,372 and $52,422 are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of
cash flows for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company incurred losses of $148 and $290 on the sale of
$21,520 and $52,712 of accounts receivable in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Losses on the sale of these
receivables are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations and comprehensive income.

Depreciation expense was $21,681 and $20,949, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017
and 2016, substantially all of which related to costs of goods sold.

In the third quarter of 2016, the Company and one of its customers mutually decided to abandon a
certain product line, which resulted in the idling of one manufacturing line. The Company determined
these factors represented an indicator of impairment, and the assets, which had a carrying value of $12,798,
were tested for recoverability in accordance with the FASB’s ASC Topic 360. The Company determined
that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to support the carrying value of the
assets, and an impairment charge of $4,720 was recognized to write the assets down to their estimated fair
value of $8,078. The estimate of fair value was based on non-recurring, Level 3 fair value measures that
were estimated through appraisal considering the cost and market approaches to value personal property.

years. Amortization expense was $3,084 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

**8. Investments Accounted for Using the Equity Method**

During 2014, the Company purchased a 20% ownership interest in Casablanca Industries Private
Limited (Casablanca), an entity that manufactures aluminum aerosol cans in India. The majority
shareholder in Casablanca is a related party to Exal Group. Casablanca is a variable interest entity (VIE);
however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary. The variable interest in the
VIE is primarily related to subordinated financial support. Although this financial arrangement resulted in
the Company holding variable interests in this entity, it does not empower the Company to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Company further
determined that the related party is most closely associated with the VIE. Accordingly, Casablanca is not
consolidated and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting with the investment having been
recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company’s proportionate share of Casablanca’s undistributed
earnings or losses. The Company’s investment in Casablanca totaled $1,545 and $1,804 as of December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

On March 3, 2017, the Company refinanced all of its debt, including its related party debt which was
repaid on this date, and replaced it with a new long-term debt (‘‘2017 Credit Facility’’) expiring in March of
2022. The 2017 Credit Facility comprised of $170,000 of term loans and $55,000 of revolving line of credit.
$50,000 of the revolving line of credit is available to Exal Corporation and $5,000 is available to Exal
Argentina, S.A. The Company incurred $6,776 in financing fees while securing the new credit facility. The
Company recorded fees of $1,651 related to securing the new revolving credit facility as an unamortized
asset, and fees related to the term loans of $5,125 as a reduction of the carrying value of long-term debt
upon issuance. The Company fully amortized $863 of deferred financing fees remaining from the original
credit agreement as of March 3, 2017.

Under the 2017 Credit Facility, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had unused revolving lines of
credit of $42,000 and $1,000 for Exal Corporation and Exal Argentina, S.A., respectively. At December 31,
2016, under the prior credit facility, the Company had unused revolving lines of credit of $25,567. Both
credit facilities include interest rates on new borrowings based on adjusted LIBOR or prime rates and
other adjustments associated with the financial covenants. The Company pays a monthly commitment fee
equal to 0.50% per year on the undrawn portion of the credit facility.

Under the 2017 Credit Facility, term loans are due in quarterly payments of 1.25% of the total
outstanding balance, with annual increases at June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2019 to 1.875%, and 2.50%,
respectively, with any remaining principal and accrued interest due March 3, 2022. The credit facility is

**9. Financing Arrangements (Continued)**

Under the prior credit facility, the term loans were due in quarterly payments of 1.25% of the total
outstanding balance, with annual increases at June 30 of each year to 1.875%, 2.50% and 3.125%,
commencing June 2013, with any remaining principal and accrued interest due in June 2017. The credit
facility was secured by the Company’s building and various interests in common stock and assets of the
European and South American subsidiaries. The credit facility contained restrictive covenants, including
covenants relating to capital expenditures and certain financial ratios. As of February 19, 2016, the credit
agreement was amended to revise certain negative covenants and financial ratios. All covenants of the
credit facility were met as of December 31, 2016.

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $0, and $1,781, respectively, of outstanding letters
of credit.

In January 2016, the Company adopted FASB’s ASU 2015-03. The Company capitalizes loan
origination costs and legal costs associated with its financing arrangements and amortizes them over the
life of the related loans. Amortization of these deferred financing costs was $1,994 and $2,064, respectively,
for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and is classified as interest expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. As a result of adopting this
amendment, unamortized financing costs are presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability and totaled $5,645 and $1,590 at December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively.

Additionally, as of April 2010, the Company entered into a $25,000 mezzanine subordinated debt
facility with the partners of Element Holdings II, L.P. (its Parent), which includes interest payments at a
12% fixed rate and payment in kind (PIK) interest at a 3% fixed rate, with all outstanding principal and
interest payable June 2018. After the first quarter of 2015, all of the interest payments are being treated as
PIK. Accrued interest of $12,563 plus unpaid principal of $25,000, totaling $37,563 are shown as notes
payable to related parties on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016. On March 3, 2017,
accrued interest of $13,643 and $25,000 of principal was paid to the holders of the mezzanine subordinated
debt facility in conjunction with the 2017 refinancing.

Interest expense was $11,904 and $14,952 (including $1,080 and $5,144 of related-party interest
expense) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

profits, as defined, less interest. The profit sharing percentage ranges from 0% to 10% of profits as

On December 22, 2017, a comprehensive U.S. tax reform bill originally known as the ‘‘Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act’’ was enacted into law. The Company is required to recognize the effect of the Tax Reform in its
2017 consolidated financial statements, even though the effective date of the law for most provisions is
January 1, 2018. Based on information currently available, the Company’s 2017 consolidated financial
statements will include a one-time benefit to net income of approximately $8,500 to reflect the
remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower U.S. corporate
income tax rate which has been reduced from 35% to 21%.

**12. Income Taxes (Continued)**

The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from the Company’s estimates, possibly
materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made by the Company as well as
additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax
Reform Legislation.

The Company’s reported income tax expense differs from the statutory federal income tax rate
primarily due to state and local taxes (net of federal benefit), non-deductible operating expenses, the
domestic production activity deduction and the impact of foreign operations with tax rates different than
the statutory federal income tax rate.

The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were, at December 31:

**2017** **2016**

Deferred tax assets:

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had approximately $40,758 and $36,963, respectively,
of net operating loss carryforwards, some of which may be carried forward indefinitely and the remainder
of which expire in various years. These net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset a portion of
future taxable income and, thereby, reduce or eliminate the foreign income taxes otherwise payable.

**13. Commitments and Contingencies**

The Exal Group is a defendant in legal actions from normal business activities. At December 31, 2017,
management believes that these matters are without merit and the likelihood of loss is remote. The
ultimate liability, if any, upon resolution will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial
position, operations or cash flows of the Company.

The Company has unit option plans under which options to purchase units of its Parent have been
granted to directors and key employees at the market value of the units at the date of grant. Payment must
be made at the time of exercise. In general, options are exercisable in five equal installments commencing
from the date of grant and terminating 10 years from the date of grant. A summary of unit option activity
for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, follows:

These options cannot be traded in any equity market. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
options granted in 2017 and 2016 have estimated fair values at the date of grant of $4.04 to $4.98 and $3.58
per unit, respectively. The actual value an employee may realize will depend on the excess of the unit price
on the date the option is exercised over the exercise price. Consequently, there is no assurance that the
value realized by an employee will be at or near the value estimated on the grant date.

The fair values were estimated using the following assumptions for options granted in:

**2017** **2016**

Expected dividend yield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . **0.00%** 0.00%

**17. Insurance Recoveries**

On October 25, 2017, a fire occurred at the Company’s packaging facility in Garin, Argentina. The fire
took place in the warehousing area of the plant and no production assets were damaged. During the fourth
quarter of 2017, the packaging facility was not able to operate at full capacity as the initial cleanup
activities impacted the entire facility. The Company maintains property insurance coverage to mitigate
losses. The damages from the fire exceeded the Company’s insurance deductible of $80.

The Company recorded $3,000 of insurance recoveries during the fourth quarter of 2017 relating to
the property damage and this amount is included in operating expenses in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The amount represented a partial settlement of the
