You should consult your own professional advisers for an understanding of the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and how those differences could affect the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum.

509,Offerings 2019.md,932,NOTES ON DEFINED TERMS USED IN THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM,932.4,Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements,932.4.1,,"The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements included in this Offering Memorandum have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ireland. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements reflect the metal food and specialty business of Ardagh Group S.A. that have not in the past formed a separate accounting group. These businesses do not constitute a separate legal entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared by aggregating the financial information for the metal food and specialty business, comprising the entities constituting the Ardagh Carve-out Business together with the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the Ardagh Carve-out Business. For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, please see Note 2 ‘‘Summary of Significant xii ----- Accounting Policies’’ to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This basis of preparation sets out the method used in identifying the financial position, performance and cash flows of the metal food and specialty business that has been included in Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. The notes explain that the businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements have not operated as a separate stand-alone entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business adopted IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019, and applied the modified retrospective approach which does not require restatement of prior periods. As detailed in Note 2 of the Ardagh Carve-out Business Unaudited Interim Combined Financial Statements ‘‘Summary of significant accounting policies,’’ the adoption of IFRS 16 impacts on the combined income statement and certain key financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges recognized in the combined income statement. The application of the new standard decreases both cost of sales and operating costs (excluding depreciation) in the combined income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted EBITDA, but this will be largely offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and finance expenses.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

509,Offerings 2019.md,932,NOTES ON DEFINED TERMS USED IN THIS OFFERING MEMORANDUM,932.6,Pro Forma Financial Information,932.6.1,,"While it has not yet been determined, the information contained in the unaudited pro forma combined financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum has been presented on the basis that Trivium will record the businesses contributed to it on formation at fair value, including goodwill. This involves measuring the cost of the businesses contributed and allocating, at the Completion Date, the cost of the businesses contributed to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. Identifiable assets contributed and liabilities assumed will be measured initially at their fair values at the Completion Date. Trivium intends to measure the consideration transferred to each of the contributing parties, including Trivium equity transferred, at fair value. The Combination has not been completed, and, as a result, we are not currently in a position to measure fair values and make the related adjustments to the recorded values of identifiable assets and liabilities of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and the Exal business, respectively. Following completion of the accounting for the Combination (including measurement of fair values), we will make any necessary adjustments to recorded values of the contributed assets and liabilities. We currently expect that the majority of the adjustments will result in adjustments to property, plant and equipment, the creation of intangible assets and goodwill and an increase in the fair value of inventory. The adjustments to intangible assets are likely to result in additional charges for amortization, which will have a negative effect on operating profit. Similarly, the adjustment to inventory will result in a corresponding increase in cost of sales which will be recognized and reduce operating profit during the period in which the acquired inventory is sold. The unaudited pro forma financial information included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum does not reflect any fair value accounting adjustments for the Combination. The adjustments that will occur on completion of the final accounting for the Combination could have a material impact on the pro forma combined financial information. xiii ----- The unaudited pro forma income statement information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2018. The summary unaudited pro forma balance sheet data as of March 31, 2019, gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on that date. This unaudited pro forma financial information is based on available information and various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, including the receipt of all consents and approvals required for completion of the Combination. Completion of the Combination as contemplated in this Offering Memorandum is subject to legally required staff consultation in certain jurisdictions. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial information and actual amounts. The unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects a number of adjustments made to the financial information of the Exal business. It is expected that Trivium will follow the presentation and accounting policies applied by Ardagh and so no adjustments are required to adjust the accounting policies and presentation of financial information followed by the Ardagh Carve-out Business for purposes of the unaudited pro forma financial information. The compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial information and the adjustments reflected therein are explained as follows: - Adjustments have been made to convert the underlying U.S. GAAP financial information set forth in the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS and in alignment with the expected IFRS accounting policies of Trivium. These adjustments are based on management’s analysis of the major GAAP and accounting policy differences between Trivium and the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that a full IFRS conversion of the financial information set forth in the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements to be performed on completion of the Combination would not result in different numbers, and such differences may be material. - The underlying financial information of Exal has been adjusted to align the presentation of certain income statement items with the expected presentation of such financial information by Trivium. The basis for the adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information and the key assumptions made are explained in the notes to the information accompanying the tables. The pro forma financial information presented within ‘‘Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information’’ has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Exchange Act or U.S. GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) or U.S. GAAS. The unaudited pro forma combined financial and other data set forth elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum should be read in conjunction with the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements and the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

We define ‘‘Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA’’ as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for: the impact of new accounting standards with respect to leases, and the impact of cost saving initiatives arising as a result of planned optimization, reorganization and operational improvement initiatives. We defined ‘‘Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA Margin’’ and ‘‘Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA Margin’’ as Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, divided by revenue. In relation to the Ardagh Carve-out Business, we define ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA’’ as profit before tax, net finance expense, depreciation and amortization and exceptional operating items, and ‘‘Adjusted EBITDA margin’’ as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin, Pro Forma Supplemental Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin and related ratios should not be considered in isolation and are not measures of our financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity as derived in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS and non-GAAP financial measures do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available for cash requirements and may not be indicative of our results of operations. In addition, such measures, as we define them, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

We also supply the paints and coatings and general household care end use categories. Our customers include a wide variety of leading consumer packaged goods (‘‘CPG’’) companies which value our packaging solutions for their convenience and quality, as well as the end user appeal they offer through design, 1 ----- innovation, functionality, premium association and brand enhancement. With our significant invested capital base, extensive technological capabilities and manufacturing know-how, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to meet the dynamic needs of our global customers. Substantially all our revenue is derived from end use categories where we believe we hold #1 or #2 positions within the respective geographies we serve, and we aim to build on these leadership positions in these large, stable and attractive markets in the future. We serve over 1,300 customers across more than 70 countries, comprised of multi-national companies, large national and regional companies and small local businesses. In our target regions of Europe, North America and South America our customers include a wide variety of CPG companies, which own some of the best-known brands in the world. We have a stable customer base with long-standing relationships, including an average tenure of over 15 years with our ten largest customers. Approximately 60% of our sales are generated under multi-year contracts, with the remainder largely subject to annual arrangements. A significant portion of our revenues are generated under contracts which include input cost pass-through provisions, which help us reduce margin volatility due to changes in raw material costs. In 2018, Trivium had 57 facilities, located in 21 countries and had approximately 7,800 employees. Our plants are well-located to serve our customers, with some located on-site or near-site to our customers’ filling locations. Certain facilities may also be dedicated to end use categories, generating benefits of scale and production efficiencies. Significant capital has been invested in our well-invested and extensive network of long-lived production facilities, which, together with our skilled workforce and related manufacturing process know-how, supports our competitive positions. Organic growth initiatives have also involved expansionary strategic investments in new capacity of over $350 million in new facilities since 2013. Notable investments in this period have included: (i) two new can-making facilities in Roanoke, Virginia and Reno, Nevada, as well as a significant expansion of our Conklin, New York, ends plant; positioning us to meet substantially all the metal packaging requirements of a major U.S. CPG company pursuant to a long-term contract; (ii) the material enhancement of our South American aerosol production capabilities and capacity to serve growing demand in that region, including the completion of a new state-of-the-art aluminum slug production facility; and (iii) consistent investment in our European business in pursuit of growth opportunities in selected end use categories, including the infant formula/nutrition market, where demand growth is driven by emerging market consumption, and in single-serve pet food formats, where convenience and a trend to premium products is evident. These initiatives, as well as other acquisitions and investments over many years, in both existing and adjacent end use categories, have increased our scale and diversification and provided opportunities to grow our business with existing and new customers. We are committed to maintaining the industry leading innovation history of both the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal. To this end, we focus on four main areas of research and development (‘‘R&D’’): (i) innovations that provide improved product design, differentiation and usability; (ii) innovations that reduce metal content to generate cost savings (down-gauging); (iii) developments to meet evolving food safety standards and regulations; and (iv) innovations that address consumers’ preference for sustainable packaging by allowing our customers to migrate to metal as a packaging material. Our worldwide manufacturing footprint is supported by a dedicated R&D center in France, which has developed numerous award-winning innovations and solutions for our customers over many years.

509,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Position by Geography and End Use Category Geography** **Our Position** **End Use Category / Product,9.5.2,Reasons for the Combination,"We believe that the combination of the complementary Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal to form a leading metal packaging provider offers attractive opportunities for future growth, as we continue to serve our customers’ desire for high-quality, innovative and sustainable solutions in support of their brands. Our ability to service customers across a broader range of geographies represents a significant potential benefit. We are well positioned to pursue attractive secular growth opportunities with our well-invested asset base, where we have spent in excess of $350 million on new production facilities since 2013. We believe in the highly complementary fit of our businesses, with no geographic overlap in end use categories served. Our Company has an attractive and diversified material mix, encompassing approximately 70% tinplate steel and 30% aluminum product offerings, to deliver differentiated and premiumized solutions to meet customer needs. Moreover, the Combination will provide for diversification in terms of product, end market, customers and geography. Further, we continuously support product and process innovations, as well as sustainability initiatives, with our dedicated research and development center. Although we operate in relatively mature industries, we have identified attractive growth opportunities in the regions and end use categories which we serve. Overall, we believe metal packaging is positioned to benefit from the accelerating focus on sustainability. Attractive growth opportunities include the potential for further penetration of lighter-weight two-piece food cans in North America, increasing demand for single-serve products in end use categories such as pet food and seafood, the shift from tinplate steel to aluminum aerosol containers in North America, growth in aerosol markets in South America and growth in the nutrition end use category. We believe we have an attractive financial profile characterized by stability and underpinned by resilient product demand, longstanding relationships with customers with whom we generally have long-term contracts with pass-through provisions. Our well-invested asset base enjoys a low-cost profile and, in conjunction with our relatively low level of maintenance capital expenditures, lead to a high level of cash conversion in our business. We also see significant scope to enhance performance through the sharing of best practices across all aspects of our combined business. We believe that the business system approach applied by Exal in recent years, which yielded an improvement of over 1,000 basis points in Adjusted EBITDA for the period 2015 (17.8% Adjusted EBITDA margin) to 2018 (27.9% Adjusted EBITDA margin), can deliver significant benefits to our enlarged business over the medium term. This will involve the implementation of commercial and operational optimization initiatives across our business, including continuous benchmarking of process and performance, business mix enhancement, accelerating growth and innovation opportunities, complexity reduction, a focus on value over volume and targeted investments, including in automation to drive efficiency, quality and cost performance. We have identified commercial and operational excellence opportunities which are expected over the next few years to generate approximately $40 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA net benefits. We expect to realize these benefits after targeted investments in our selling, general and administrative cost base.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571
509,Offerings 2019.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Our Position by Geography and End Use Category Geography** **Our Position** **End Use Category / Product,9.5.3,Industry Overview,"The global packaging industry is a large, consumer-driven industry with stable growth characteristics. We operate in the metal container sectors and our target regions are Europe, North America and South America. Metal containers are attractive to brand owners, as their strength and rigidity allows them to be filled at high speeds and easily transported, while their shelf-stable nature means that refrigeration is not required, thereby resulting in further energy savings in the supply chain. The ability to customize and differentiate products supplied in metal containers, through innovative design, shaping and printing, also appeals to our customers. The metal container market has been marked by progressive down-gauging, which has generated material savings in input costs and logistics, while enhancing the consumer 7 ----- experience. This reduction in raw material and energy usage in the manufacturing process has also increased the appeal to end-users, who are increasingly focused on sustainability. Metal can packaging is approximately a $55 billion global revenue industry that is comprised of beverage cans (45% of the market), food (including seafood) cans (30%) and other cans (25%), according to Smithers Pira, a leading independent market research firm. Despite competition from other formats and materials, metal cans remain a key food packaging format, owing to their attractive value proposition. The use of metal cans as a food packaging format is expected to have modest but stable growth of 0.6% per annum, for the next few years, principally driven by macroeconomic growth, as forecasted by Smithers Pira. Global sales of aerosol cans continue to increase, driven by rising demand for beauty and personal care and household products. Growing levels of disposable income and a focus on convenience, together with a shift in material mix from tinplate steel to aluminum are among the factors which will drive future aerosols demand, according to Smithers Pira. Other cans is a diverse market segment encompassing a wide variety of metal packaging containers serving end user applications, such as nutrition, beer kegs for at-home use and paints and coatings. This market segment benefits from multiple drivers of demand, including convenience and sustainability. Collectively, North America, Latin America and Europe constitute 79% of the global food end use category by revenue and 52% of the ‘‘other’’ end use category by revenue, according to Smithers Pira. We believe the purchasing decisions of retail consumers are significantly influenced by packaging. Consumer product manufacturers and marketers increasingly use packaging to position their products in the market and differentiate them on retailers’ shelves. The development and production of premium, specialized packaging products with a combination of value-added features requires a high level of design capability, manufacturing and process know-how and quality control to consistently produce lightweight products, with strong barrier and anti-rust properties. Additional industry trends such as SKU proliferation and demand for convenience products, such as reclosable bottles, which are a cost-competitive alternative to tinplate based products for smaller pack sizes, also provide opportunities for selective growth in new and emerging end use categories. Metal packaging offers performance and convenience for CPG companies compared to alternatives. It acts as a superior barrier to oxygen and light and is resilient, as it can be unbreakable, tamper-proof and fire and temperature resistant. Moreover, it is convenient, and can be lighter or more robust, with portable characteristics and easy open and recloseable solutions. When used in the food market, metal has the advantage of retaining nutritional value, without the requirement for preservatives. From a supply chain perspective, metal packaging allows for efficient transportation and storage and is suited to processing on installed high-speed filling lines and retort processes. From a sustainability perspective, metal is the most recycled material globally and can be infinitely recycled without any degradation in quality. Metal packaging is officially endorsed as a preferred material by the E.U. and, with a growing awareness among end consumers of sustainability issues, has added appeal to brand owners in helping to meet their own ambitious sustainability goals and commitments. The metal packaging industry benefits from the stability of its end use categories, with selective opportunities for attractive growth. Metal packaging represents a proven value proposition for CPG companies and it is a stable technology with minimal substitution risk.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The historical financial data presented in the following table do not reflect changes as a result of the Transactions. The summary financial data and other data should be read in conjunction with ‘‘Selected Combined Financial and Other Data of the Ardagh Carve-out Business,’’ ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects of the Ardagh Carve-out Business—Results of Operations of Ardagh Carve-out Business’’ and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future expected results. We have derived the summary financial data as of and for the financial years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 from the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements reflect the metal food and specialty business of Ardagh Group S.A. that have not in the past formed a separate accounting group. These businesses do not constitute a separate legal entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared by aggregating the financial information for the metal food and specialty business, comprising the entities constituting the Ardagh Carve-out Business together with the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the Ardagh Carve-out Business. For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, please see Note 2 ‘‘Summary of Significant Accounting Policies’’ to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This basis of preparation sets out the method used in identifying the financial position, performance and cash flows of the metal food and specialty businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. The notes explain that the businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements have not operated as a separate stand-alone entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business adopted IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019, and applied the modified retrospective approach which does not require restatement of prior periods. As detailed in Note 2 of the Ardagh Carve-out Business Unaudited Interim Combined Financial Statements ‘‘Summary of significant accounting policies,’’ the adoption of IFRS 16 impacts on the combined income statement and certain key financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges recognized in the combined income statement. The application of the new standard decreased both cost of sales and operating costs (excluding depreciation) in the combined income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted EBITDA, but this is largely offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and finance expenses. 21 ----- For a detailed discussion of the presentation of financial data, see ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Data.’’",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

If economic conditions affect consumer demand, our customers may be affected, thus reducing the demand for our products.","Demand for our packaging depends on demand for the products which use our packaging, which is primarily consumer driven. General economic conditions may adversely impact consumer confidence, resulting in reduced spending on our customers’ products and, thereby, reduced or postponed demand for our products. Adverse economic conditions may also lead to more limited availability of credit, which may have a negative impact on the financial condition, particularly on the purchasing ability, of some of our customers and distributors and may also result in requests for extended payment terms, and result in credit losses, insolvencies and diminished sales channels available to us. Our suppliers may have difficulties obtaining necessary credit, which could jeopardize their ability to provide timely deliveries of raw materials and other essentials to us. Adverse economic conditions may also lead to suppliers requesting credit support or otherwise reducing credit, which may have a negative effect on our cash flows and working capital.

Changes in global economic conditions may reduce our ability to forecast developments in our industry and plan our operations and costs, resulting in operational inefficiencies. Negative developments in our business, results of operations and financial condition due to changes in global economic conditions or other factors could cause ratings agencies to lower the credit ratings, or ratings outlook, of our shortand long-term debt and, consequently, impair our ability to raise new financing or refinance our current borrowings and increase our costs of issuing any new debt instruments. Furthermore, the economic outlook could be adversely affected by the risk that one or more eurozone countries could leave the European Monetary Union, or the euro as the single currency of the eurozone could cease to exist. Any of these developments, or the perception that any of these developments are likely to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the economic development of the affected countries and could lead to severe economic recession or depression, and a general anticipation that such risks will materialize in the future could jeopardize the stability of financial markets or the overall financial and monetary system.

Competition in the market for customized, differentiated packaging is based on price and, increasingly, on innovation, design, quality and service. The most competitive aspect of the metal packaging market is the sale of undifferentiated, standardized food cans.

509,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.6,"Because our customers are concentrated, our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to maintain relationships with our largest customers.","For the year ended December 31, 2018, Ardagh Carve-out Business’ ten largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of its revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Exal’s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 78% of its consolidated revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Trivium’s ten largest customers would have accounted for approximately 39% of its consolidated revenues. We believe our relationships with these customers are good, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these relationships. For Trivium, approximately 60% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, were under multiyear supply agreements of varying terms, with the remaining revenues generally under one-year agreements. Although these arrangements have provided, and we expect they will continue to provide, the basis for long-term partnerships with our customers, there can be no assurance that our customers will not cease purchasing our products. If our customers unexpectedly reduce the amount of metal cans they purchase from us, or cease purchasing metal cans altogether, our revenues could decrease and our inventory levels could increase, both of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, while we believe that the arrangements that we have with our customers will be renewed, there can be no assurance that such arrangements will be renewed upon their expiration or that the terms of any renewal will be as favorable to us as the terms of the current arrangements. There is also the risk that our customers may shift their filling operations to locations in which we do not operate.

For example, in 2017, Reckitt Benckiser merged with Mead Johnson Nutrition Company. Such consolidation has increased the concentration of our net sales with our largest customers and may continue in the future. In many cases, such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices. Increased pricing pressures from our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, this consolidation may lead manufacturers to rely on a reduced number of suppliers.

Certain end products represent a significant proportion of our packaging market. In the past, the occurrence of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and swine fever have sometimes led to reduced demand for associated canned products, such as sauces, soups and ready meals, and publicity about the supposed carcinogenic effect of coatings used on some cans may have affected sales of canned products. 31 ----- Any decline in the popularity of these product types as a result of lifestyle, nutrition, health considerations or consumer taxation could have a significant impact on our customers and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571
509,Offerings 2019.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business,13.1.9,"Our profitability could be affected by the availability and cost of raw materials, including as a result of changes in tariffs and duties.","The raw materials that we use have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources. For certain raw materials, however, there may be temporary shortages due to weather, transportation, production delays or other factors. In such an event, no assurance can be given that we would be able to secure our raw materials from sources other than our current suppliers on terms as favorable as our current terms, or at all. Any such raw materials shortages or any material increases in the cost of any of the principal raw materials that we use, including the introduction of new tariffs, could also inhibit our ability to secure necessary raw materials. For example, in 2018, tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum were introduced in the United States. These tariffs were initially imposed by the United States on all countries, but as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, no longer apply to such imports from Canada and most such imports from Mexico, though new tariffs have been applied to certain fabricated steel imports from Mexico. Further tariffs, duties or other increases in the cost to transport materials to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or those of our customers. Furthermore, the relative price of oil and its by-products may impact our business by affecting transport, lacquer and ink costs. The primary raw materials that we use are steel (both in tinplate and tin-free forms) and aluminum. Steel is generally purchased under one-year contracts with prices that are usually fixed in advance. When such contracts are renewed in the future, our steel costs under such contracts will be subject to prevailing global steel prices at the time of renewal, which may be different from historical prices. The hedging market for steel, and in particular that for coking coal, is a new market with limited depth and, as a consequence, there might be limitations on our ability to hedge steel input prices. In the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ European operations, aluminum is generally purchased under three-year contracts. In contrast, Exal typically purchases aluminum at spot market index rates. Aluminum ingot is traded daily as a commodity on the London Metal Exchange, which has historically been subject to significant price volatility. Because aluminum is priced in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/euro rate also affect the euro cost of aluminum ingot. In contrast to steel, the hedging market for aluminum is well-developed and its depth does not pose a limitation on the ability to place hedges in the market. The Ardagh Carve-out Business has historically hedged its aluminum exposure, while Exal has not. We expect this trend to continue for our operations going forward, due to the pricing preferences of our customers. Our business is exposed to both the availability of aluminum and the volatility of aluminum prices, including associated premiums. While raw materials are generally available from independent suppliers, raw materials are subject to fluctuations in price and availability attributable to a number of factors, including general economic conditions, commodity price fluctuations (with respect to aluminum on the London Metal Exchange), the demand by other industries for the same raw materials and the availability of complementary and substitute materials. Adverse economic or financial changes could impact our suppliers, thereby causing supply shortages or increasing costs for our business. While the majority of our sales to customers are made via sales contracts which include provisions enabling us to pass-through increases in certain input costs, we may not be able to pass on all or substantially all raw material price increases, now or in the future. In addition, we may not be able to hedge successfully against raw material cost increases. Furthermore, steel and aluminum prices are subject to considerable volatility in price and demand. While in the past sufficient quantities of steel and aluminum have been generally available for purchase, these quantities may not be available in the future, and, even if available, we may not be able to continue to purchase them at current prices. Further increases in the cost of these raw materials could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows. 32 ----- The supplier industries from which we receive our raw materials are relatively concentrated, and this concentration can impact raw material costs. Over the last ten years, the number of major steel and aluminum suppliers has decreased and further consolidation could hinder our ability to obtain adequate supplies of these raw materials, potentially leading to higher prices for steel and aluminum. The failure to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials or future price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Insofar as possible, we will actively manage currency exposures through the deployment of assets and liabilities throughout the Group and, when necessary and economically justified, enter into currency hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by hedging against rate changes with respect to our anticipated functional currency, the euro. However, we may not be successful in limiting such exposure, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our presented results may be impacted as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the euro. We have production facilities in 21 different countries worldwide. We also sell products to, and obtain raw materials from, companies located in these and different regions and countries globally. As a consequence, a significant portion of our consolidated revenue, costs, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the euro, particularly the U.S. dollar, the pound, the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. The exchange rates between the currencies which we are exposed to, such as the euro, the U.S. dollar, the pound, the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso, have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. In our European operations, we incur currency transaction risks primarily on metal purchases (or the hedging of those purchases), as metal prices are denominated in U.S. dollars, and on revenue denominated in currencies other than the euro supplied from facilities in euro-participant territories (or the hedging of those sales). In addition to currency transaction risk, we are subject to currency translation risk. Our policy is, where practical, to match net investments in foreign currencies with borrowings in the same currency. The debt and interest payments relating to our Danish and Polish operations are all denominated in euro. Fluctuations in the value of these currencies with respect to the euro may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in exchange rates can affect our ability to purchase raw materials and sell products at profitable prices, reduce the value of our assets and revenues, and increase liabilities and costs. We are also exposed to interest rate risk. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect our interest expense on the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes and the cost of new financing. We use cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage this risk, but sustained increases in interest rates could nevertheless materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Such laws and regulations which may affect our operations include, among others, requirements regarding remediation of contaminated soil, groundwater and buildings, water supply and use, natural resources, water discharges, air emissions, waste management, noise pollution, asbestos and other deleterious materials, the generation, storage, handling, transportation and disposal of regulated materials, product safety and workplace health and safety. Such laws and regulations are also subject to constant review by lawmakers and regulators which may result in further environmental legal requirements. 34 ----- We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with such legal requirements, and these costs are likely to increase in the future. Inquiries and enforcement by other regulators, including demands for more stringent pollution control devices could also result in the need for further capital upgrades to our furnaces and plant operations at substantial cost. We require a variety of permits to conduct our operations, including operating permits such as those required under various U.S. laws, including the federal Clean Air Act and the E.U. Industrial Emissions Directive, water and trade effluent discharge permits, water abstraction permits and waste permits. We are in the process of applying for, or renewing, permits at a number of our sites. Failure to obtain and maintain the relevant permits, as well as noncompliance with such permits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were to violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations or our permits, we could be subject to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions and liabilities, including substantial fines and orders, or a partial or total shutdown of our operations. In order to comply with air emission restrictions, significant capital investments may be necessary at some sites. Our business is also affected by the E.U. ETS, which limits emissions of greenhouse gases. See ‘‘The Trivium Business—Environmental, Health and Safety and Product Safety Regulation.’’ This scheme, any future changes to it and any additional measures required to control the emission of greenhouse gases that may apply to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes to the laws and regulations governing the materials that are used in our manufacturing operations may impact the price of such materials or result in such materials no longer being available, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The E.U. passed regulations concerning REACH, which place onerous obligations on the manufacturers and importers of substances, preparations and articles containing substances, and which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, substances we use may have to be removed from the market (under REACH’s authorization and restriction provisions) or need to be substituted for alternative chemicals which may also adversely impact upon our operations. Sites at which we operate often have a long history of industrial activities and may be, or have been in the past, engaged in activities involving the use of materials and processes that could give rise to contamination and result in potential liability to investigate or remediate, as well as claims for alleged damage to persons, property or natural resources. Liability may be imposed on us as owners, occupiers or operators of contaminated facilities. These legal requirements may apply to contamination at sites that we currently or formerly owned, occupied or operated, or that were formerly, owned, occupied or operated by companies we acquired or at sites where we have sent waste offsite for treatment or disposal. Our closure of a site may accelerate the need to investigate and remediate any contamination at the site.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Changes in laws and regulations laying down restrictions on, and conditions for use of, food contact materials or on the use of materials and agents in the production of our products could likewise adversely affect our business. Changes to health and food safety regulations could increase costs and also might have a material adverse effect on revenues if, as a result, the public attitude toward end products, for which we provide packaging, were substantially affected. Additionally, the effectiveness of new standards such as the ones related to recycling or deposits on different packaging materials could result in excess costs or logistical constraints for some of our customers who could choose to reduce their consumption and even terminate the use of metal packaging for their 35 ----- products. We could thus be forced to reduce, suspend or even stop the production of certain types of products. Environmental concerns could lead E.U. or U.S. bodies to implement other product regulations that are likely to be restrictive for us and have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There is significant variation, among countries where we sell our products, in the limitation on certain constituents in packaging, which can have the effect of restricting the types of raw materials we use. In turn, these restrictions can increase our operating costs, such as increased energy consumption, and the environmental impacts of our operations. Other changes, such as restrictions on BPA in coatings for some of our products, as well as on the usage of chromium VI in consumer products and industrial processes, which have been proposed or adopted in the E.U. under the REACH legislation and some of its member states, have required us to develop substitute materials for our production.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Because of the age of some of our sites, however, asbestos-cement may have been used in construction and may still be present at these sites. When these buildings are modernized or repaired, the cost of upgrades is higher because of the restrictions associated with removing asbestos-containing materials. We are exposed to claims alleging injury or illness associated with asbestos and related compensation over and above the support that may be offered through various existing social security systems in countries where we operate. We are also exposed to claims alleging musculoskeletal disorders caused by performing certain repetitive operations or motions.

If we are involved in any future litigation, or if our positions concerning current disputes are found to be incorrect, this may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, because of potential negative outcomes, the costs associated with asserting our claims or defending such lawsuits, and the diversion of management’s attention to these matters.

The additional costs associated with these and other benefits to employees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, these obligations may rank senior to the Guarantees of the Notes in a bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor as a matter of law. We operate a number of pension and other post-retirement benefit schemes funded by a range of assets which may include property, derivatives, equities and/or bonds. The value of these assets is heavily dependent on the performance of markets which are subject to volatility.

The consequences of a product not meeting these rigorous standards, due to, among other things, accidental or malicious raw materials contamination or due to supply chain contamination caused by human error or equipment fault, could be severe. Such consequences might include adverse effects on consumer health, litigation exposures, loss of market share, financial costs and loss of revenues. 37 ----- In addition, if our products fail to meet rigorous standards, we may be required to incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action (up to and including recalling products from consumers) and to reimburse customers and/or end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of this failure. Customers and end consumers may seek to recover these losses through litigation and, under applicable legal rules, may succeed in any such claim, despite there being no negligence or other fault on our part. Placing an unsafe product on the market, failing to notify the regulatory authorities of a safety issue, failing to take appropriate corrective action and failing to meet other regulatory requirements relating to product safety could lead to regulatory investigation, enforcement action and/or prosecution. Any product quality or safety issue may also result in adverse publicity, which may damage our reputation. This could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have not had material claims for damages for defective products in the past, and have not conducted any substantial product recalls or other material corrective action, these events may occur in the future. In certain contracts, we provide warranties in respect of the proper functioning of our products and the conformity of a product to the specific use defined by the customer. In addition, if a product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated, it is possible that the manufacturer of the product may allege that our packaging is the cause of the fault or contamination, even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications. In case of the failure of packaging produced by us to open properly or to preserve the integrity of its contents, we could face liability to our customers and to third parties for bodily injury or other tangible or intangible damages suffered as a result.

Currently, the United Kingdom is due to leave the E.U. on October 31, 2019. In November 2018, the United Kingdom and the E.U. agreed upon a draft withdrawal agreement setting out the terms of the United Kingdom’s departure. This agreement included a two-year transition period, during which the E.U. would treat the United Kingdom as if it were still a member of the E.U. This was included to facilitate the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the E.U. and to provide additional legal certainty once E.U. law ceases to apply to the United Kingdom. However, this agreement was subsequently rejected by the U.K. Parliament several times. On April 11, 2019, the European Council granted an extension of the notice period under Article 50 to October 31, 2019. Discussions regarding the terms of the United Kingdom’s exit are therefore ongoing. Nevertheless, if the U.K. Parliament does not approve a withdrawal deal before October 31, 2019, then (subject to any further extension of the negotiation period being agreed to by the United Kingdom and a unanimous decision of the European Council or the United Kingdom revoking Brexit altogether), the United Kingdom will leave the E.U. without a deal on that date. In such a scenario, the United Kingdom will, subject to any unilateral exemptions or bilateral topic-by-topic deals, lose the trade agreements it has in place with other countries as a member of the E.U. and trade with both the E.U. and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties based on World Trade Organization terms. Additionally, the movement of goods between the United Kingdom and the remaining member states of the E.U. could be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. These changes to the trading relationship between the United Kingdom and E.U. could result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the United Kingdom. Ongoing uncertainty on whether the government and U.K. parliament of the United Kingdom and the E.U. will agree to a revised withdrawal agreement sustains the possibility that the United Kingdom will leave the E.U. without a withdrawal agreement and transition period in place. Moreover, on May 24, 2019, Theresa May announced her resignation as Prime Minister, leading the way to the future election of a new leader for the Conservative party who is currently expected to become Prime Minister on July 24, 2019, thus adding increased uncertainty to the U.K.’s domestic political situation. Approximately 8% of Trivium’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, would have been derived from revenues generated in the United Kingdom. Any changes to the trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the E.U. may adversely affect the cost or timing of imports, including aluminum and coatings in our operations. Further, while we predominantly sell to customers in the local U.K. market, some of our customers based in the U.K. who export outside the local U.K. market may experience reduced demand and/or delays arising from Brexit and post-Brexit arrangements. These negative impacts could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, because of the extent of our business in the United Kingdom, the precise impact of Brexit is difficult to predict and may include 39 ----- effects beyond those described herein, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, political instability as a result of Brexit may result in a material negative effect on credit markets and foreign direct investments in Europe and the United Kingdom. Uncertainty related to Brexit has also resulted in exchange rate volatility between the British pound and other currencies. See also our risk factor under ‘‘Risks Relating to Our Business’’ entitled ‘‘Currency, interest rate fluctuations and commodity prices may have a material impact on our business.’’ This deterioration in economic conditions could result in increased unemployment rates, increased short- and long-term interest rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, a decline in the strength of national and local economies, and other results that negatively impact household incomes. The economic outlook could be further adversely affected by the risk that one or more E.U. member states could leave the E.U. as well, the risk of a greater push for independence by Scotland or Northern Ireland. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility.

If the Combination has not been consummated by the Escrow Longstop Date or, upon the occurrence of certain events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption. If this occurs, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, the escrowed funds will only be in the amount of the gross proceeds received from the offering of the Notes, and will not be sufficient to pay the special mandatory redemption amount, which includes accrued and unpaid interest up to, but not including, the redemption date. See ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes— Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ In addition, the cash and property held in the Escrow Accounts may be invested in certain permitted investments, including in commercial paper, long-term and short-term debt obligations, and money market funds, _provided that such investment is rated: (i) in the case of long-term debt obligations, at least (a) ‘‘AAA’’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (‘‘S&P’’), (b) ‘‘Aaa’’ by Moody’s Investors Service Inc.

However, despite the rating requirement, there are certain risks that may occur as a result of these permitted investments, which may lead to a diminished or total loss of returns on such investments, none of which are under the Issuer’s control. These include risks relating to indices, interest rates and other market risks as they apply to the particular investments. In addition, the counterparty which provided the investment may face financial difficulties, and if they are not able to redeem the investment in full, this may lead to a shortfall in such Escrow Accounts. Further, if the Escrow Agent or any of the securities depositaries it transacts with face operational or financial difficulties, the same risks may occur. Further, depending on the investment, the Escrow Agent may not be able to liquidate the investment promptly if it becomes illiquid or has a specific maturity. This may lead to delays in obtaining a cash return on the amounts in such Escrow Account, which would be required to return cash to holders of the Notes, or may lead to losses if the risks above apply to such investments. There can be no assurance that the investment policy relating to the permitted investments or other risks mentioned above will not cause a shortfall in cash to enable the Issuer to fund the special mandatory redemption in the manner as described in ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.’’ Although the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, will be granted first-priority liens on the applicable funds in the escrow accounts, the ability of holders of the Notes to realize such funds may be subject to certain bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer.

Those risks can increase where the joint venture is formed by and among entities that, but for the joint venture, would compete with each other in certain markets, as is the case to some degree with Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business. Integrating Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business may require significant resources and management attention. In addition, the cost savings and synergies that have been estimated in connection with the Combination may prove to be unrealistic or unobtainable for a number of reasons, including the fact that certain key managers, executive officers and directors of Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business were unable to share certain proprietary business information with each other prior to obtaining antitrust and competition law approval from regulatory authorities. In order to successfully combine and operate Exal and the Ardagh Carve-out Business, our management will need to focus on managing the historical customer and supplier relationships of these businesses while also working to realize the anticipated synergies and cost savings on a timely basis.

Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and synergies may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: - the ability of business units and employees from different corporate heritages to work together effectively; and - the ability to leverage a low-cost, efficient distribution system, and optimize procurement savings with respect to certain raw materials. Moreover, the potential cost savings and synergies we currently expect to result from the Combination are only estimates and may not actually be achieved in the time frame anticipated or at all. In addition, the Combination could subject us to additional risks, including: - costs relating to the Combination and related transactions, such as financing, legal and accounting fees, as well as unanticipated or higher than expected one-off costs related to operating the business; - uncertainties relating to the Combination and related transactions may adversely affect relationships with our employees, vendors and customers. For example, we estimate that approximately $300 million of our revenue is sourced from overlapping current customers of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal; and - difficulty meeting our external reporting obligations because Exal has historically used different accounting principles than the Ardagh Carve-out Business. Furthermore, there may be additional costs or liabilities associated with the Combination that are not currently anticipated, including unexpected loss of key employees or customers and hiring additional management and other critical personnel. Also, please see the description of additional integration-related risks in ‘‘—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may incur unforeseen risks and costs relating to 43 ----- acquisitions.’’ Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

These limitations arise under various provisions or principles of corporate law which include rules governing capital maintenance, under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective, as well as thin capitalization, unfair consideration, financial assistance, corporate purpose or similar law affecting the rights of creditors generally and fraudulent transfer principles. If these limitations were not observed, the Guarantees and the grant of Security Interests by these Post-Completion Date Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge. In some jurisdictions, the Guarantees will contain language limiting the amount of debt guaranteed or secured so that applicable local law restrictions will not be violated. Certain of the Security Documents will contain similar limitations. Accordingly, if you were to enforce the Guarantees by a 53 ----- Post-Completion Date Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions or seek to enforce a Security Interest in Collateral granted by a Post-Completion Date Guarantor in one of these jurisdictions, your claims are likely to be limited. In some cases, where the amount that can be guaranteed or secured is limited by reference to the net assets and legal capital of the Post-Completion Date Guarantor or by reference to the outstanding debt owed by the relevant Post-Completion Date Guarantor to the Issuer under intercompany loans, that amount might have reached zero or close to zero at the time of any insolvency or enforcement. Furthermore, although we believe that the Guarantees by these Post-Completion Date Guarantors and the Security Interests granted by these Post-Completion Date Guarantors will be validly given in accordance with local law restrictions, there can be no assurance that a third-party creditor would not challenge these Guarantees and the Security Interests and prevail in court.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, 90 days following the Completion Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Post-Completion Date Guarantors. The Post-Completion Date Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of one of British Columbia (Canada), Delaware (United States), Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Ohio (United States), Poland and Spain. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and, in the case of the Guarantees and the Security Interests, limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantee against a Guarantor and the enforceability of the Security Interests. 54 ----- The court or an insolvency administrator may also in certain circumstances avoid the Security Interest or the Guarantee where the company is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees and the Security Interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the Security Interests; - direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or Security Interest is found to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor under its Guarantee or the Security Interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such Guarantee or Security Interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. Also, there is a possibility that the Guarantees or Security Interests may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests created, the relevant Guarantor: - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Guarantee or created such Security Interest in a situation where a prudent businessman as a shareholder of such Guarantor would have contributed equity to such Guarantor; or - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or Security Interest on the basis that the Guarantee or Security Interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s benefit, or some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the Security Interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any Security Interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; and/or 55 ----- - the present salable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the offering of the Notes, there can be no assurance which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was ‘‘insolvent’’ as of the date the Guarantees were issued or the Security Interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or Security Interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The policy statement does not include concrete legislative proposals, but instead sets out a large number of policy intentions of the new Dutch government. In the policy statement, it was announced that The Netherlands will introduce a new withholding tax on interest payments paid to low-taxed jurisdictions. In a letter dated February 23, 2018, to the Dutch Parliament, the Dutch Under-Minister of Finance published more details about the proposed introduction of withholding tax on interest payments. According to the letter, the interest withholding tax would apply to intragroup interest payments by a Dutch resident entity to entities that are resident (i) in a jurisdiction with a low statutory tax rate or (ii) in a jurisdiction included in the E.U. list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. In addition, the letter states that measures will be taken to counteract ‘‘abusive situations’’ (misbruiksituaties). According to the letter, abusive situations include situations where a payment of interest is not made directly to a low-taxed or non-cooperative jurisdiction, but where such interest indirectly reaches such jurisdiction by means of an artificial construction. In his letter, the Dutch Under-Minister of Finance announced that it is intended for the withholding tax on interest payments to be effective from 2021 and that a legislative proposal will be submitted to the Dutch parliament in 2019. This was reiterated by the Dutch Under-Minister of Finance in one of the legislative proposals published on budget day 2018 (Prinsjesdag 2018). The exact scope of the proposed legislation is not yet certain. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the envisaged interest withholding tax could have a wider application and, as such, it could potentially be applicable to payments made by the Issuer and Guarantors under the Notes. If such payments become subject to Dutch withholding tax under the envisaged legislation, the Issuer and Guarantors generally will be required to pay Additional Amounts (see ‘‘Taxation—Netherlands Taxation,’’ ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes’’), which may give rise to an event whereby the Issuer may be entitled to redeem the Notes (see ‘‘Description 56 ----- of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption’’).",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. These interest rates could also rise significantly in the future.

Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be 58 ----- predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the ‘‘FCA Announcement’’).

Under the Transaction Agreement, in exchange for the equity interests in the Ardagh Carve-out Business, the Parent Guarantor will (i) issue to the Ardagh Group, or its designated controlled affiliate, ordinary shares representing 43% of the Parent Guarantor’s issued and outstanding equity interests, and (ii) pay to the Ardagh Group in cash the equivalent of $2,500 million (the ‘‘Ardagh Cash Consideration’’) and in exchange for the equity interests in Exal, the Parent Guarantor will issue to Element or its designated controlled affiliate, ordinary shares representing 57% of the Parent Guarantor’s issued and outstanding equity interests (the ‘‘Combination’’). The Ardagh Cash Consideration as well as the number of the Parent Guarantor’s ordinary shares to be issued to Element are subject to a customary purchase price adjustment to reflect changes in our net debt, cash and net working capital between execution of the Transaction Agreement and the Completion Date. If, however, the number of ordinary shares issuable to Element after giving effect to the purchase price adjustment would result in Element owning less than 51.0% of the Parent Guarantor’s ordinary shares, Element will receive 51.0% of the Parent Guarantor’s ordinary shares and will pay to the Parent Guarantor, in cash, an amount equal to the number of ordinary shares that would have been issued to Element in excess of 51.0% multiplied by the per share price of $24.3831. The terms of the Transaction Agreement include, among other things: - Customary representations and warranties given by Element in respect of Exal and by the Ardagh Group in respect of the Ardagh Carve-out Business. - Customary interim operating covenants in respect of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and in respect of Exal, including requiring the Ardagh Group and Exal to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and restrictions on their ability to sell assets, amend the organizational documents of any legal entities in the Ardagh Carve-out Business or Exal, declare dividends, enter into material contracts, change their accounting policies or issue any new securities, incur, assume or guarantee indebtedness. - Indemnification for certain losses in connection with the investigation initiated in 2015 by the German competition authority. See ‘‘The Trivium Business—Legal Proceedings’’. - Conditions to closing of the Combination that need to be satisfied or waived in accordance with the Transaction Agreement, including: (i) no action, order or law shall have been in effect that restrains or prohibits the Combination or would rescind the Combination following the Completion Date, 60 ----- (ii) certain fundamental representations and warranties of each of Element and the Ardagh Group being true and correct and other non-fundamental representations being true and correct except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect, (iii) each of Element and the Ardagh Group having complied with their respective covenants under the Transaction Agreement in all material respects, (iv) the obtaining of all required regulatory approvals and consents agreed among the parties; (v) the completion of certain works council consultation processes in France and the Netherlands; and (vi) issuing the Notes offered hereby and entering into the ABL Facility on terms satisfactory to the Element and the Ardagh Group. - The right to terminate the Transaction Agreement by Element or the Ardagh Group (i) in the event that not all of the conditions to closing set forth therein have been satisfactorily fulfilled or waived by January 14, 2020 (the ‘‘Termination Date’’), provided the Termination Date may be extended to April 14, 2020 in the event that regulatory approvals and consents are not obtained by such date; (ii) in the event a government order permanently enjoins, restrains or prohibits the consummation of the Combination; (iii) for a violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or failure to perform any covenant or agreement, by the other party if such violation, breach or failure gives rise to a material breach or failure to deliver a closing deliverable that, if curable, is not cured within 20 business days; and (iv) by mutual written consent; provided that neither Element nor the Ardagh Group is permitted to terminate the Transaction Agreement for the reasons described in the foregoing clauses (i) or (iii) if, in the case of clause (i) its own breach of its representations, warranties or covenants is the reason why the Combination failed to close by the Termination Date or, in the case of clause (iii) it is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants under the Transaction Agreement and such breach is not cured within 20 business days and would give rise to the failure of the closing conditions relating to breaches of representations, warranties and covenants not to be satisfied. None of the representations, warranties or covenants required to be performed prior to the Completion Date will survive the closing of the Combination (other than the interim operating covenants and expense reimbursement covenants, which will survive for a period of twelve months following such closing).

The historical financial data presented in the following table do not reflect changes as a result of the Transactions. The selected financial data and other data should be read in conjunction with ‘‘Summary Combined Financial and Other Data of the Ardagh Carve-out Business,’’ ‘‘Operating and Financial Review and Prospects of the Ardagh Carve-out Business—Results of Operations of Ardagh Carve-out Business’’ and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future expected results. We have derived the summary financial data as of and for the financial years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 from the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements reflect the metal food and specialty business of Ardagh Group S.A. that have not in the past formed a separate accounting group. These businesses do not constitute a separate legal entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements have been prepared by aggregating the financial information for the metal food and specialty business, comprising the entities constituting the Ardagh Carve-out Business together with the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the Ardagh Carve-out Business. For a complete description of the accounting principles followed in preparing the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements, please see Note 2 ‘‘Summary of Significant Accounting Policies’’ to the Ardagh Carve-out Business Audited Annual Combined Carve-out Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This basis of preparation sets out the method used in identifying the financial position, performance and cash flows of the metal food and specialties businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements. The notes explain that the businesses included in the Ardagh Carve-out Business Combined Carve-out Financial Statements have not operated as a separate stand-alone entity or group. The Ardagh Carve-out Business adopted IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019, and applied the modified retrospective approach which does not require restatement of prior periods. As detailed in Note 2 of the Ardagh Carve-out Business Unaudited Interim Combined Financial Statements ‘‘Summary of significant accounting policies,’’ the adoption of IFRS 16 impacts on the combined income statement and certain key financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges recognized in the combined income statement. The application of the new standard decreased both cost of sales and operating costs (excluding depreciation) in the combined income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted EBITDA, but this is largely offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and finance expenses. 65 ----- For a detailed discussion of the presentation of financial data, see ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Data.’’",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

This involves measuring the cost of the businesses contributed and allocating, at the Completion Date, the cost of the businesses contributed to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. Identifiable assets contributed and liabilities assumed will be measured initially at their fair values at the Completion Date. Trivium intends to measure the consideration transferred to each of the contributing parties, including Trivium equity transferred, at fair value. The Combination has not been completed, and, as a result, we are not currently in a position to measure fair values and make the related adjustments to the recorded values of identifiable assets and liabilities of the Ardagh Carve-out Business and the Exal business, respectively. Following completion of the accounting for the Combination (including measurement of fair values), we will make any necessary adjustments to recorded values of the contributed assets and liabilities. We currently expect that the majority of the adjustments will result in adjustments to property, plant and equipment, the creation of intangible assets and goodwill and an increase in the fair value of inventory. The adjustments to intangible assets are likely to result in additional charges for amortization, which will have a negative effect on operating profit. Similarly, the adjustment to inventory will result in a corresponding increase in cost of sales which will be recognized and reduce operating profit during the period in which the acquired inventory is sold. The unaudited pro forma financial information set forth below does not reflect any fair value accounting adjustments for the Combination. The adjustments that will occur on completion of the final accounting for the Combination could have a material impact on the pro forma combined financial information. The following unaudited pro forma income statement information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2019, gives effect to Transactions as if they had occurred on April 1, 2018. The summary unaudited pro forma balance sheet data as of March 31, 2019, gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on that date. We are not presenting full pro forma balance sheet information in this Offering Memorandum. This unaudited pro forma financial information is based on available information and various assumptions that management believe to be reasonable, including the receipt of all consents and approvals required for completion of the Transactions. Completion of the Transactions as contemplated in this Offering Memorandum is subject to legally required staff consultation in certain jurisdictions. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the unaudited pro forma combined financial information and actual amounts. The unaudited pro forma financial information is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the Transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or financial position. The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects a number of adjustments made to the financial information of the Exal business. It is expected that Trivium will follow the presentation and accounting policies applied by Ardagh and so no adjustments are required to adjust the accounting policies and presentation of financial information followed by the Ardagh Carve-out Business for purposes of the unaudited pro forma financial information. The compilation of the unaudited pro forma financial information and the adjustments reflected therein are explained as follows: - Adjustments have been made to convert the underlying U.S. GAAP financial information set forth in the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS and in alignment with the expected IFRS accounting policies of Trivium. These adjustments are based on management’s analysis of the major GAAP and accounting policy differences between Trivium and the Exal Consolidated Financial 71 ----- Statements. There can be no assurance that a full IFRS conversion of the financial information set forth in the Exal Consolidated Financial Statements to be performed on completion of the Combination would not result in different numbers, and such differences may be material. - The underlying financial information of Exal has been adjusted to align the presentation of certain income statement items with the expected presentation of such financial information by Trivium. - The impact of any new contractual agreements that are factually supportable, directly related to the acquisitions and are expected to have a continuing impact. The basis for the adjustments reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information and the key assumptions made are explained in the notes to the information accompanying the tables. The following pro forma financial information presented has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S X under the Exchange Act or U.S. GAAP. Neither the adjustments nor the resulting pro forma financial information have been audited or reviewed in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) or U.S. GAAS.

In addition, certain other factors affect the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ revenue and operating profit/(loss). The Ardagh Carve-out Business generates its revenue from supplying metal containers to a wide range of primarily consumer-driven end use categories. Revenue is primarily dependent on sales volumes and sales prices. Sales volumes are influenced by a number of factors, including factors driving customer demand, seasonality and the capacity of the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ plants. Demand for our metal containers may be influenced by vegetable and fruit harvests, seafood catches, trends in the consumption of food, trends in the use of consumer products, industry trends in packaging, including marketing decisions, the impact of increasing sustainability awareness and changes in environmental regulations. The size and quality of harvests and catches vary from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather in the regions in which the Ardagh Carve-out Business operates. The food can industry is seasonal in nature, with strongest demand during the end of the summer, coinciding with the harvests. Accordingly, the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ volume of containers shipped is typically highest in the second and third quarters and lowest in the first and fourth quarters. Accordingly, the Ardagh Carve-out Business generally builds inventories in the first quarter in anticipation of the seasonal demands. The Ardagh Carve-out Business generates the majority of its earnings from operations during the second and third quarters. Ardagh Carve-out Business’ Adjusted EBITDA is based on revenue derived from selling our metal containers and is affected by a number of factors, primarily cost of sales. The elements of the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ cost of sales include (i) variable costs, such as electricity, raw materials (including the cost of tinplate steel and aluminum), packaging materials, decoration and freight and other distribution costs, and (ii) fixed costs, such as labor and other plant-related costs, including depreciation, maintenance and sales, marketing and administrative costs. The Ardagh Carve-out Business’ variable costs have typically constituted approximately 80% of the total cost of sales for our metal containers manufacturing business. 78 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $16 million to $108 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $92 million in the same period in 2017 primarily due to increased capital expenditures related to the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ short payback projects as described above in addition to increased capital expenditures relating to intangible asset investments in the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ information technology of $11 million. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $27 million to $92 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $65 million in the same period in 2016 primarily due to the timing of capital expenditure cash outflows related to investments in the Ardagh Carve-out Business’ program of continuous improvement initiatives, including the carry forward impact related to a number of projects initiated in year ended December 31, 2016. _Net inflow/(outflow) from financing activities_ Net cash from financing activities represented an inflow of $51 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to a $21 million inflow in the same period in 2018 primarily due to $31 million additional cash received from the Ardagh Group.

Currency exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities.

The majority of the tinplate steel purchases of the Ardagh Carve-out Business are obtained under one-year contracts with prices that are usually fixed in advance. When such contracts are renewed in the future, our tinplate steel costs under such contracts will be subject to prevailing global steel and/or tinplate steel prices at the time of renewal, which may be different from historical prices. The hedging market for iron ore, and in particular that for coking coal, is a relatively new market which does not have the depth of the aluminum market and, as a consequence, there might be limitations to placing hedges in the market. Aluminum ingot is traded daily as a commodity on the London Metal Exchange, which has historically been subject to significant price volatility. Because aluminum is priced in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/euro rate also affect the euro cost of aluminum ingot. The price and foreign currency risk on the aluminum purchases in the operations are hedged by entering into swaps under which the Ardagh Carve-out Business pays fixed euro prices. Furthermore, the relative price of oil and its by-products may materially impact the Ardagh Carve-out Business, affecting our transport, lacquer and ink costs. The Ardagh Carve-out Business uses derivative agreements to manage some of the material cost risk. The Ardagh Carve-out Business depends on an active liquid market and available credit lines with counterparty banks to cover this risk. The use of derivative contracts to manage its risk is dependent on robust hedging procedures. Increasing raw material costs over time has the potential, if it is unable to pass on price increases, to reduce sales volume and could therefore have a significant impact on its financial condition. The Ardagh Carve-out Business is also exposed to possible interruptions of supply of steel and aluminum or other raw materials and any inability to purchase raw materials could negatively impact its operations. As a result of the volatility of gas and electricity prices, the Ardagh Carve-out Business has either included energy pass-through clauses in its sales contracts or developed an active hedging strategy to fix a significant proportion of its energy costs through contractual arrangements directly with its suppliers, where there is no energy clause in the sales contract. Where pass-through contracts do not exist, the Ardagh Carve-out Business policy is to purchase gas and electricity by entering into forward price-fixing arrangements with suppliers for the bulk of its anticipated requirements for the year ahead. Such contracts are used exclusively to obtain delivery of its 87 ----- anticipated energy supplies. The Ardagh Carve-out Business does not net settle, nor does it sell within a short period of time after taking delivery. The Ardagh Carve-out Business avails of the own-use exemption and, therefore, these contracts are treated as executory contracts. The Ardagh Carve-out Business typically builds up these contractual positions in tranches of approximately 10% of the anticipated volumes. Any gas and electricity which is not purchased under forward price-fixing arrangements is purchased under index tracking contracts or at spot prices.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Credit risk arises from derivative contracts, cash and deposits held with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to the customers of the Ardagh Carve-out Business, including outstanding receivables. The policy of the Ardagh Carve-out Business is to place excess liquidity on deposit with the Ardagh central group treasury entity who will, in turn, only place excess liquid funds with recognized and reputable financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘‘BBB+’’ from at least two credit rating agencies are accepted, where possible. The credit ratings of banks and financial institutions are monitored to ensure compliance with the Ardagh Group policy. Risk of default is controlled within a policy framework of dealing with high quality institutions and by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one bank or institution. The policy of the Ardagh Carve-out Business is to extend credit to customers of good credit standing. Credit risk is managed on an ongoing basis, by experienced people within the Ardagh Carve-out Business.

The Ardagh Carve-out Business does not expect any significant counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset.

Exal’s Brazilian market is experiencing strong underlying growth and Exal expects a high portion of conversions to aerosol from tin and plastic in the beauty and personal care market. In North America, Exal sees itself at the forefront of growing the aluminum aerosol segment, which is highly under-penetrated in relation to other developed regions, such as Europe. In both markets, Exal sees the underlying consumer trends of premiumization and sustainability as a key component of aluminum’s value proposition. Finally, Exal’s production pipeline of more than one billion units supports the strong demand growth in each of these markets. Exal is a strategic partner to blue-chip, global CPG companies. Exal has long-standing relationships with eight of its top customers that stretch back more than ten years and are supported by strong contracts which include take-or-pay agreements and account for the majority of volume in South America. Exal also has an exceptional financial profile, with a demonstrated track record of profitable growth and margin-expansion with industry-leading EBITDA margins and free cash flow conversion. Exal has numerous competitive advantages. In South America, its competitive advantage is based on its upstream vertical integration into slug manufacturing in Madryn, Argentina, which provides a strong cost and quality advantage. Built in 2014, the slug plant in Madryn supplies all of Exal’s Argentina and Brazil slug needs. The Madryn plant provides Exal with a consistent long-term supply of high quality slugs to support Exal’s growth in South America and enables Exal to opportunistically sell slugs to third parties. Moreover, the Madryn plant allows Exal to produce proprietary alloys to be used in innovative lightweight products. Production of slugs in the Madryn plant fulfills all of Exal’s needs for high-quality slugs in South America. Another aspect of Exal’s competitive advantages is its strong asset base, which has continuously been the beneficiary of investment since 2013. For example, approximately $45 million was invested in a greenfield slug manufacturing in South America for vertical integration, which has created a low-cost position. Moreover, this facility uses high-quality raw materials and creates the ability to achieve further light-weighting of its products. Additionally, Exal has invested approximately $95 million in a greenfield Brazil aerosol can facility with six manufacturing lines. There have been other major investments, including investment in a new line in Argentina in 2018 and in upgrading multiple lines in North America, which has created advanced global shaping capability. Exal believes it is viewed as a leader in innovation and is a value-added partner to its customers, providing them with valuable solutions. Exal benefits from a talented management team and a dynamic culture. Exal’s proven management team has a track record of value creation. Since the beginning of 2016, Exal has brought new talent into 27 of 37 management positions. Exal has a proven business system approach, using a common operating language and value creation approach providing the tools, processes and capabilities to the Exal organization in order to achieve excellence in core business capabilities through best-in-class execution of fundamental business processes. The business system approach is driven by four performance and capability engines: i) commercial excellence in marketing, pricing, contract, customer and sales force management, customer service and product development; ii) supply chain excellence in sourcing and procurement, sales and operational planning, inventory, network optimization, delivery service (OTIF) and value engineering; iii) operational excellence in safety, quality, cost, maintenance and lean processes; and iv) financial excellence in accounts receivable, accounts payable, cash and foreign exchange management and debt levels and compliance.

A key global economic trend is the premiumization of aluminum consumer goods packaging to align with premium, differentiated customer-facing brands, by way of superior graphics and printing, shaping, with better functionality such as lightweight products, with strong barrier and anti-rust properties. Additional global economic trends are SKU proliferation and demand for convenience products, such as reclosable bottles and smaller pack sizes (which are a cost-competitive alternative to tin-based products). Moreover, aluminum-based packaging is environmentally sustainable. Not only is aluminum infinitely recyclable, but it also has high recycling rates. Additionally, the creation of recycled aluminum uses less than 10% of the energy required to create primary aluminum. Aluminum’s properties position it to benefit from the increasing backlash against the use of plastic products. Another main factor affecting Exal’s results of operations are input costs, specifically the cost of aluminum. Exal’s pricing structure allows it to pass-through cost changes to customers. A large portion of Exal’s volumes are provided via contracts providing for nearly full pass-through on aluminum and other costs. Foreign exchange rate fluctuations, particularly those in South America, affect Exal’s operations. Exal currently benefits from a degree of contractual foreign exchange protection from its existing customers, and is currently in the process of enhancing that protection for a significant portion of its business in Argentina. Since 2015, the Exal business has repositioned itself from a focus on the mass beverage market in North America to premium, high-value niches in aluminum aerosols and aluminum bottles, while continuing to invest in growth opportunities in South America. This repositioning has been enhanced by an improved focus on commercial and operational excellence. In parallel, since 2013, Exal has invested over $140 million in the Brazilian aerosol can manufacturing and the Madryn slug manufacturing facilities in support of customers’ growing demand for aluminum aerosol packaging. 91 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower Argentina aerosol volume as well as lower volumes at our Argentina filling facility due to softness in the Argentine economy. These decreases were partially offset by significant growth in Brazil aerosol volume. Revenue in North America was stable year over year, as lower volumes were offset by a favorable product mix. _Cost of goods sold_ Exal’s cost of goods sold decreased by $4 million (8.0%) to $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $50 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to lower volumes in Argentina and the United States, partially offset by volume growth in Brazil and continued improvements in operating efficiencies in South America. _Selling, general and administrative cost_ Exal’s selling, general and administrative cost increased by $1 million (16.7%) to $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative cost was driven by investments in management in the current year. 92 ----- _Depreciation and amortization_ Exal’s depreciation and amortization was broadly stable at $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, despite additional capital investments to add capacity and improve operating efficiency. _Other expenses_ Exal’s other expenses increased by $1 million (33.3%) to $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses on Exal’s net asset position in Argentina as the Argentine peso weakened significantly against the U.S. dollar in the current period. This increase was partially offset by lower South American financial taxes in the current period. _Insurance claim income, net_ Exal’s insurance claim income was zero for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to net insurance income of $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net insurance claim income was primarily due to the fact that all insurance recoveries related to the Exal Packaging fire and the Madryn equipment malfunction were finalized during 2018. _Operating income_ Exal’s operating income decreased by $5 million (41.7%) to $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to $2 million of insurance income, net, that was recognized in the prior year as well as higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses on Exal’s net asset position in Argentina in the current period. _Interest expense_ Exal’s interest expense was stable at $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018 as lower amortization of deferred financing fees and lower outstanding debt balances in the three months ended March 31, 2019 were largely offset by higher average interest rates on outstanding debt. _Income before taxes_ Exal’s income before taxes decreased by $5 million (55.6%) to $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to $2 million of insurance income, net, that was recognized in the prior year as well as higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses on Exal’s net asset position in Argentina in the current period. _Benefit from (provision for) income taxes_ Exal’s provision for income taxes decreased by $1 million (50.0%) to $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in provision for income taxes was primarily due to a decrease in income before taxes, as well as the mix of U.S. and foreign income before taxes. _Net income_ Exal’s net income decreased by $4 million (57.1%) to $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net income was 93 ----- primarily due to $2 million of insurance income, net, that was recognized in the prior year as well as higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses in the current period, partially offset by a lower provision for income taxes.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The increase in revenues was primarily due primarily driven by strong volume demand in North America aerosol, partially offset by lower volumes in Exal’s Argentina filling facility. _Cost of goods sold_ Exal’s cost of goods sold increased by $11 million (6.3%) to $186 million for 2018 compared to $175 million for 2017. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the overall increase in volume. _Selling, general and administrative cost_ Exal’s selling, general and administrative cost was broadly stable at $26 million for 2018 compared to 2017, as cost pressure was offset by favorable foreign currency impacts in South America and lower management incentive compensation. _Depreciation and amortization_ Exal’s depreciation and amortization increased by $2 million (8.0%) to $27 million for 2018 compared to $25 million for 2017. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to capital investments in equipment upgrades in North America and capacity expansion in South America. _Transition and integration expenses_ Exal’s transition and integration expenses increased by $1 million (50.0%) to $3 million for 2018 compared to $2 million for 2017. The increase in transition and integration expenses was primarily due to higher severance costs as Exal rationalized resources to align with expected volumes. _Loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets_ Exal’s loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets increased by $4 million to $6 million for 2018 compared to $2 million for 2017. The increase in loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets was primarily due to an impairment charge relating to three manufacturing lines in Exal’s North America operations that had been taken out of service in previous years. _Other expenses_ Exal’s other expenses increased by $9 million (56.3%) to $25 million for 2018 compared to $16 million for 2017. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency remeasurement in 2018 associated with Exal’s South America operations, principally driven by the Argentina business, and higher transaction-related expenses in 2018. These increases were partially offset by lower financial taxes in South America and lower provision for related-party debt. _Insurance claim income, net_ Exal’s insurance claim income, net of $10 million for 2018 was primarily attributable to the recovery of losses associated with the Exal Packaging fire and an equipment malfunction at Exal’s Madyrn facility. 94 ----- _Operating income_ Exal’s operating income decreased by $1 million (3.8%) to $25 million for 2018 compared to $26 million for 2017. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses largely offset by higher net insurance claim income. _Interest expense_ Exal’s interest expense increased by $1 million (9.1%) to $12 million for 2018 compared to $11 million for 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to slightly higher interest rates in 2018 compared to 2017. _Interest expense-related parties_ Exal’s interest expense-related parties decreased by $1 million to zero for 2018 compared to $1 million for 2017. The decrease was due to refinancing of related party debt with long-term debt during 2017. _Income before taxes_ Exal’s income before taxes decreased by $1 million (7.1%) to $13 million for 2018 compared to $14 million for 2017. The decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses largely offset by higher insurance claim income, net and the refinancing of related party debt with long-term debt. _Benefit from (provision for) income taxes_ Exal’s benefit from (provision for) income taxes increased by $1 million to a benefit of $1 million for 2018 compared to a provision for zero for 2017. The increase in benefit from income taxes was primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance associated with Exal’s Argentina slug manufacturing facility which was merged into its Argentina can manufacturing facility during 2018, allowing Exal to utilize previously reserved net operating losses as well as the mix of United States and foreign income before taxes, partially offset by the deferred tax impact of lower tax rates enacted in the United States during 2017. _Net income_ Exal’s net income was flat at $14 million for 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the factors mentioned above.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease of volume in North American as Exal transitioned away from the beverage market, largely offset by strong growth in aerosol volumes in both North and South America. _Cost of goods sold_ Exal’s cost of goods sold decreased by $10 million (5.4%) to $175 million for 2017 compared to $185 million for 2016. The decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to the lower volume as Exal transitioned from the beverage market to the aerosol market, as well as initial results from Exal’s production efficiency efforts. 95 ----- _Selling, general and administrative cost_ Exal’s selling, general and administrative cost increased by $2 million (8.3%) to $26 million for 2017 compared to $24 million for 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative cost was primarily due to the transition to the current leadership team to support growth objectives, including consulting support resources. _Depreciation and amortization_ Exal’s depreciation and amortization increased by $1 million (4.2%) to $25 million for 2017 compared to $24 million for 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to additional capacity growth investments, most notably associated with Exal’s Brazil operations to capture volume growth in this region. _Transition and integration expenses_ Exal’s transition and integration expenses decreased by $2 million (50.0%) to $2 million for 2017 compared to $4 million for 2016. The decrease in transition and integration expenses was primarily due to lower levels of separation benefits during 2017. _Loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets_ Exal’s loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets decreased by $3 million (60.0%) to $2 million for 2017 compared to $5 million for 2016. The decrease in loss on write-down or disposal of fixed assets was primarily due to the impairment of manufacturing lines taken out of service in Exal’s North American facility during 2016. _Other expenses_ Exal’s other expenses increased by $10 million to $16 million for 2017 compared to $6 million for 2016. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher financial taxes in South America due to significant capacity growth investments at Exal’s Brazilian operations, as well as higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses. _Operating income_ Exal’s operating income was $26 million for 2017 compared to $26 million for 2016. Operating income increased primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as Exal transitioned from the beverage market to the aerosol market, which was offset by higher South American financial taxes and higher foreign currency remeasurement expenses. _Interest expense_ Exal’s interest expense increased by $1 million (10.0%) to $11 million for 2017 compared to $10 million for 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with the refinancing of Exal’s outstanding debt, as well as an approximately 60 basis point increase in interest rates during the year, partially offset by a reduction in outstanding debt levels. _Interest expense—related parties_ Exal’s interest expense—related parties decreased by $4 million (80.0%) to $1 million for 2017 compared to $5 million for 2016. The decrease in interest expense—related parties was primarily due to the related party debt being extinguished during 2017. 96 ----- _Income before taxes_ Exal’s income before taxes increased by $3 million (27.2%) to $14 million for 2017 compared to $11 million for 2016. The increase in income before taxes was primarily due lower net interest expenses and higher operating income. _Benefit from (provision for) income taxes_ Exal’s provision for income taxes was zero for 2017 compared to a provision for $8 million for 2016. The decrease provision for income taxes was primarily due to the approximately $8.5 million one-time benefit associated with the ‘‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’’ enacted in the U.S. during 2017. _Net income_ Exal’s net income increased by $11 million to $14 million for 2017 compared to $3 million for 2016.

Deferred taxes are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that either the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open, or the statute of limitation has expired.

Among other changes, the amendments eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities. For non-public entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material impact on Exal’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (‘‘ASU 2016-09’’). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, though early adoption is permitted if all amendments are adopted in the same period. On January 1, 2018, Exal adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in Exal making an accounting policy election to change how it recognizes the number of share-based payments that will ultimately vest. In the past, Exal applied a forfeiture rate to shares granted. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Exal recognizes forfeitures as they occur. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on Exal’s results of operations or financial condition. In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting (‘‘ASU 2017-09’’). ASU 2017-09 clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The guidance also clarifies that a modification to an award could be significant and therefore require disclosure, even if modification accounting is not required. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. On January 1, 2018, Exal adopted the provision of ASU 2017-09 on a prospective basis.

We also supply the paints and coatings and general household care end use categories. Our customers include a wide variety of leading CPG companies which value our packaging solutions for their convenience and quality, as well as the end user appeal they offer through design, innovation, functionality, premium association and brand enhancement. With our significant invested capital base, extensive technological capabilities and manufacturing know-how, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to meet the dynamic needs of our global customers. Substantially all our revenue is derived from end use categories where we believe we hold #1 or #2 positions within the respective geographies we serve, and we aim to build on these leadership positions in these large, stable and attractive markets in the future. We serve over 1,300 customers across more than 70 countries, comprised of multi-national companies, large national and regional companies and small local businesses. In our target regions of Europe, North America and South America our customers include a wide variety of CPG companies, which own some of the best-known brands in the world. We have a stable customer base with long-standing relationships, including an average tenure of over 15 years with our ten largest customers. Approximately 60% of our sales are generated under multi-year contracts, with the remainder largely subject to annual arrangements. A significant portion of our revenues are generated under contracts which include input cost pass-through provisions, which help us reduce margin volatility due to changes in raw material costs. In 2018, Trivium had 57 facilities, located in 21 countries and had approximately 7,800 employees. Our plants are well-located to serve our customers, with some located on-site or near-site to our customers’ filling locations.

Significant capital has been invested in our well-invested and extensive 106 ----- network of long-lived production facilities, which, together with our skilled workforce and related manufacturing process know-how, supports our competitive positions. Organic growth initiatives have also involved expansionary strategic investments in new capacity of over $350 million in new facilities since 2013. Notable investments in this period have included: (i) two new can-making facilities in Roanoke, Virginia and Reno, Nevada, as well as a significant expansion of our Conklin, New York, ends plant; positioning us to meet substantially all the metal packaging requirements of a major U.S. CPG company pursuant to a long-term contract; (ii) the material enhancement of our South American aerosol production capabilities and capacity to serve growing demand in that region, including the completion of a new state-of-the-art aluminum slug production facility; and (iii) consistent investment in our European business in pursuit of growth opportunities in selected end use categories, including the infant formula/nutrition market, where demand growth is driven by emerging market consumption, and in single-serve pet food formats, where convenience and a trend to premium products is evident. These initiatives, as well as other acquisitions and investments over many years, in both existing and adjacent end use categories, have increased our scale and diversification and provided opportunities to grow our business with existing and new customers. We are committed to maintaining the industry leading innovation history of both the Ardagh Carve-out Business and Exal. To this end, we focus on four main areas of R&D: (i) innovations that provide improved product design, differentiation and usability; (ii) innovations that reduce metal content to generate cost savings (down-gauging); (iii) developments to meet evolving food safety standards and regulations; and (iv) innovations that address consumers’ preference for sustainable packaging by allowing our customers to migrate to metal as a packaging material.

Our ability to service customers across a broader range of geographies represents a significant potential benefit. We are well positioned to pursue attractive secular growth opportunities with our well-invested asset base, where we have spent in excess of $350 million on new production facilities since 2013. We believe in the highly complementary fit of our businesses, with no geographic overlap in end use categories served. Our Company has an attractive and diversified material mix, encompassing approximately 70% tinplate steel and 30% aluminum product offerings, to deliver differentiated and premiumized solutions to meet customer needs. Moreover, the Combination will provide for diversification in terms of product, end market, customers and geography. Further, we continuously support product and process innovations, as well as sustainability initiatives, with our dedicated research and development center. Although we operate in relatively mature industries, we have identified attractive growth opportunities in the regions and end use categories which we serve. Overall, we believe metal packaging is positioned to benefit from the accelerating focus on sustainability. Attractive growth opportunities include the potential for further penetration of lighter-weight two-piece food cans in North America, increasing demand for single-serve products in end use categories such as pet food and seafood, the shift from tinplate steel to aluminum aerosol containers in North America, growth in aerosol markets in South America and growth in the nutrition end use category.

509,Offerings 2019.md,941,THE TRIVIUM BUSINESS,941.4,Our Position by Geography and End Use Category Geography** **Our Position** **End Use Category / Product,941.4.3,Industry Overview,"The global packaging industry is a large, consumer-driven industry with stable growth characteristics. We operate in the metal container sectors and our target regions are Europe, North America and South America. Metal containers are attractive to brand owners, as their strength and rigidity allows them to be filled at high speeds and easily transported, while their shelf-stable nature means that refrigeration is not required, thereby resulting in further energy savings in the supply chain. The ability to customize and differentiate products supplied in metal containers, through innovative design, shaping and printing, also appeals to our customers. The metal container market has been marked by progressive down-gauging, which has generated material savings in input costs and logistics, while enhancing the consumer experience. This reduction in raw material and energy usage in the manufacturing process has also increased the appeal to end-users, who are increasingly focused on sustainability. Metal can packaging is approximately a $55 billion global revenue industry that is comprised of beverage cans (45% of the market), food (including seafood) cans (30%) and other cans (25%), according to Smithers Pira, a leading independent market research firm. Despite competition from other formats and materials, metal cans remain a key food packaging format, owing to their attractive value proposition. The use of metal cans as a food packaging format is expected to have modest but stable growth of 0.6% per annum, for the next few years, principally driven by macroeconomic growth, as forecasted by Smithers Pira. Global sales of aerosol cans continue to increase, driven by rising demand for beauty and personal care and household products. Growing levels of disposable income and a focus on convenience, together with a shift in material mix from tinplate steel to aluminum are among the factors which will drive future aerosols demand, according to Smithers Pira. Other cans is a diverse market segment encompassing a wide variety of metal packaging containers serving end user applications, such as nutrition, beer kegs for at-home use and paints and coatings. This market segment benefits from multiple drivers of demand, including convenience and sustainability. Collectively, North America, Latin America and Europe constitute 79% of the global food end use category by revenue and 52% of the ‘‘other’’ end use category by revenue, according to Smithers Pira. We believe the purchasing decisions of retail consumers are significantly influenced by packaging. Consumer product manufacturers and marketers increasingly use packaging to position their products in the market and differentiate them on retailers’ shelves. The development and production of premium, specialized packaging products with a combination of value-added features requires a high level of design capability, manufacturing and process know-how and quality control to consistently produce lightweight products, with strong barrier and anti-rust properties. Additional industry trends such as SKU proliferation and demand for convenience products, such as reclosable bottles, which are a cost-competitive alternative 112 ----- to tinplate based products for smaller pack sizes, also provide opportunities for selective growth in new and emerging end use categories. Metal packaging offers performance and convenience for CPG companies compared to alternatives. It acts as a superior barrier to oxygen and light and is resilient, as it can be unbreakable, tamper-proof and fire and temperature resistant. Moreover, it is convenient, and can be lighter or more robust, with portable characteristics and easy open and recloseable solutions. When used in the food market, metal has the advantage of retaining nutritional value, without the requirement for preservatives. From a supply chain perspective, metal packaging allows for efficient transportation and storage and is suited to processing on installed high-speed filling lines and retort processes. From a sustainability perspective, metal is the most recycled material globally and can be infinitely recycled without any degradation in quality. Metal packaging is officially endorsed as a preferred material by the E.U. and, with a growing awareness among end consumers of sustainability issues, has added appeal to brand owners in helping to meet their own ambitious sustainability goals and commitments. The metal packaging industry benefits from the stability of its end use categories, with selective opportunities for attractive growth. Metal packaging represents a proven value proposition for CPG companies and it is a stable technology with minimal substitution risk. The European food can sector is a large, mature industry with approximately 24 billion food cans produced in 2018, according to Smithers Pira. It is characterized by lightweight three-piece and two-piece cans with easy open or peelable ends that are often decorated with high quality printed graphics and other innovative designs. End use categories served include food, vegetables, fruit, pet food, seafood, ready meals and soups. Despite competition from other packaging formats, this sector is characterized by a high degree of stability, with a significant installed base of customer filling lines dedicated to filling metal packaging. The food metal can packaging industry in Europe has selective growth opportunities resulting from shifts to smaller sizes and single-serve packaging solutions in areas such as pet food and seafood. Demand in the European aerosols metal can industry is principally influenced by consumer spending patterns in the beauty and personal care and household products end use categories and has been stable in Western Europe and growing in Eastern Europe since 2013, according to Smithers Pira. The other metal can industry in Europe encompasses a broad range of end use categories, including the nutrition end use category, where growth is driven by increasing emerging market demand as a result of rising levels of disposable income and a greater awareness of health and wellness. In North America, we are a significant participant in the food can, aluminum aerosol and aluminum bottle businesses. The North American food can business, incorporating seafood and pet food cans, is a large, mature market, characterized by relatively stable demand, as modest growth in two-piece cans and pet food cans was offset by a decline in three-piece can demand in recent years. Two-piece cans are more prevalent in the United States than in Europe, but tend to be heavier than those produced in Europe. Food cans in North America also typically incorporate fewer convenience-enhancing and value-adding features, such as easy-open ends, than typically found in Europe, creating a growth opportunity for our products and innovations, including lighter-weight cans. The North American aluminum aerosol market, serving end use categories in beauty and personal care and household products has grown slightly since 2013, reflecting an increase in overall demand and a movement from tinplate steel to aluminum aerosols. This material shift has been driven by ongoing product premiumization and improved functionality for consumers, as well as by increased levels of decoration and differentiation being sought by CPG companies to market their products. In South America, where we produce aluminum aerosols in Brazil and Argentina, demand growth reflects increased levels of disposable income and increased spending on beauty and personal care products and a shift in material mix from steel aerosols to aluminum aerosols offering improved 113 ----- functionality to consumers in certain end use categories in the form of rust avoidance, and the potential for increased differentiation and brand promotion. In the aluminum premium beverage market, the convenience of the package to the consumer in the form of a lightweight, robust, re-closable and recyclable offering is complemented by the opportunity for brand owners to achieve high levels of decoration and differentiation. End use categories served by aluminum premium beverage packaging include a broad range of beverages such as beer, wine, energy drinks and ready-to-drink coffees.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

We believe that our manufacturing facilities comply, in all material respects, with these laws and regulations. 118 ----- The principal environmental issues facing us include the impact on air quality through gas and particle emissions, including the emission of greenhouse gases, the environmental impact of the disposal of water used in our production processes, the generation and disposal of waste, the receiving, use and storage of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and the potential contamination and subsequent remediation of land, surface water and groundwater arising from our operations. Our substantial operations in the E.U. are subject to, among additional requirements, the requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive (the ‘‘IED’’), which requires that operators of industrial installations, take into account the whole environmental performance of the installation and obtain and maintain compliance with a permit, which sets emission limit values that are based on best available techniques. Our E.U. production facilities are also regulated under the E.U. ETS, now in its third phase which runs until 2020. Under this regime, the European Commission sets emission caps for greenhouse gases for all installations covered by the scheme, which are then implemented by Member States. Installations that emit less than their greenhouse gas emission cap can sell emission allowances on the open market and installations that exceed their emission cap are required to buy emission allowances and are penalized if they are unable to surrender the required amount of allowances at the end of each trading year. In addition, the EPA has also begun to regulate certain greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the E.U. Directive on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage aims to make those who cause damage to the environment (specifically damage to habitats and species protected by E.U. law, damage to water resources and land contamination which presents a threat to human health) financially responsible for its remediation. It requires operators of industrial premises (including those which hold a permit governed by the IED) to take preventive measures to avoid environmental damage, inform the regulators when such damage has or may occur and to remediate contamination. Our operations are also subject to stringent and complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety and product safety including, but not limited to: the U.S. federal Clean Air Act, the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, the U.S. federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (‘‘CERCLA’’). These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require obtaining permits to conduct industrial operations; (ii) restrict the types and quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment; (iii) result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; (iv) require that additional pollution controls be installed; and (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, including related natural resource damages. Specifically, certain U.S. environmental laws, such as CERCLA or Superfund, as well as analogous state laws, provide for strict, and under certain circumstances, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of releases or the disposal of regulated materials into the environment including soil and groundwater, as well as for damages to natural resources. Moreover, restrictions on BPA in coatings for some of our products, which have been proposed or adopted in the E.U. under the REACH legislation and in some of its Member States, have required us to develop substitute materials for our production. We are also committed to ensuring that safe operating practices are established, implemented and maintained throughout our organization. In addition, we have instituted active health and safety programs throughout our company.

509,Offerings 2019.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.2,Intercreditor Agreement,59.2.5,Effect of Insolvency Event,"_General_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, until the last Discharge Date to occur in respect of any of the Secured Obligations (the ‘‘Secured Debt Discharge Date’’) in the event that any member of the Group becomes subject to an insolvency event, including under Title 11 of the United States Code entitled ‘‘Bankruptcy,’’ as now or hereafter in effect, or any successor statute (the ‘‘U.S. Bankruptcy Code’’), the Representatives and each other Primary Creditor agree not to take any action under the applicable insolvency or liquidation proceeding that would be inconsistent with its agreements in the Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Agent and, before the last Discharge Date in respect of the First Lien Obligations (the ‘‘First Lien Discharge Date’’), the Majority First Lien Creditors (as defined below) and, thereafter, the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as defined below). See ‘‘—Enforcement of Security—Manner of Enforcement—Fixed Asset Collateral’’. If any member of the Group commences an insolvency or liquidation proceeding, then the Intercreditor Agreement, which the parties expressly acknowledge is a ‘‘subordination agreement’’ under section 510(a) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, will be effective during such insolvency or liquidation proceeding of any such Debtor and the relative rights as to the Fixed Asset Collateral, the ABL Collateral and proceeds thereof and shall continue after any Debtor commences such insolvency or liquidation proceeding on the same basis as prior to the date of the petition. _Payment of Distributions_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions in respect of Intra-Group Obligations owed by a member of the Group that is not a Debtor, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Group, any party entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of such member of the Group (in the case of holders of Secured Notes and Senior Notes or any Primary Creditor whose Obligations are in the form of notes or other debt securities outstanding, only to the extent that such amount constitutes enforcement proceeds of Collateral) in respect of Obligations owed to that party shall, to the extent it is able to do so, direct the person responsible for the distribution of the assets of such member of the Group to pay that distribution to the applicable Security Agent until the Secured Debt Discharge Date. The Security Agents shall apply distributions paid to them in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Application of proceeds’’). _Set-off_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions in respect of Intra-Group Obligations owed by a member of the Group that is not a Debtor, to the extent that any member of the Group’s Obligations are discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise) after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to that member of the Group (in the case of a set-off (mandatory or otherwise) received by holders of Secured Notes and Senior Notes or any Primary Creditor whose Obligations are in the form of notes or other debt securities outstanding, only to the extent that such amount constitutes enforcement proceeds of Collateral), any creditor that benefited from that set-off shall, to the extent legally permissible, pay an amount equal to the amount of the Obligations owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the applicable Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (see ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’). The set-off provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement do not apply to certain netting by a Hedge Counterparty or any set-off which gives effect to a payment permitted to Intra-Group Lenders. 137 ----- _Non-cash Distributions_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, if either Security Agent or any other Primary Creditor receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect of any of the Obligations, the Obligations will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards the Obligations. _Filing of Claims_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Group, each Secured Creditor (including holders of Secured Notes) irrevocably authorizes the Fixed Asset Security Agent, on its behalf, to: (a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Debt Documents of such creditor) against such Group member in respect of the Fixed Asset Obligations; (b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations; (c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations; and (d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the Fixed Asset Security Agent considers reasonably necessary to recover such Group member’s Fixed Asset Obligations. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, after the occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Group, each Secured Creditor (including holders of Secured Notes) irrevocably authorizes the ABL Security Agent, on its behalf, to: (a) take any Enforcement Action (in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Debt Documents of such creditor) against such Group member in respect of the ABL Obligations; (b) demand, sue, prove and give receipt for any or all of such Group member’s ABL Obligations; (c) collect and receive all distributions on, or on account of, any or all of such Group member’s ABL Obligations; and (d) file claims, take proceedings and do all other things the ABL Security Agent considers reasonably necessary to recover such Group member’s ABL Obligations. _Further Assurance; Insolvency Event_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that each Secured Creditor (including holders of Secured Notes) will (a) do all things that each of the Security Agents reasonably requests in order to give effect to the provisions described in this ‘‘—Effect of insolvency event’’ section and (b) if the Security Agents are not entitled to take any of the actions contemplated by the ‘‘—Effect of insolvency event’’ provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or if the applicable Security Agent reasonably requests that a Secured Creditor take that action, undertake such action in accordance with the instructions of such Security Agent or grant a power of attorney to such Security Agent (on such terms as such Security Agent may reasonably require) to enable such Security Agent to take such action; _provided that nothing in paragraph will permit any Security Agent to request any action which would contravene any other provision of the Intercreditor Agreement or to allow a Security Agent to exercise, or cause any Secured Creditor to exercise, any Enforcement Action in respect of any Collateral to the extent that Security Agent was not permitted to undertake such Enforcement Action under another provision of the Intercreditor Agreement. _Financing Matters_ Until the Discharge Date in respect of the ABL Obligations (the ‘‘ABL Discharge Date’’), if any Debtor becomes subject to an insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the ABL Security Agent shall desire to permit the use of ‘‘cash collateral’’ (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) constituting ABL Collateral on which the ABL Security Agent or any other creditor has a lien or to permit any Debtor to obtain financing, whether from any ABL Creditor or any other person under Section 364 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law (‘‘DIP Financing’’) that is secured at least in part by the ABL Collateral, then, the Fixed Asset Security 138 ----- Agent, on behalf of itself and the Fixed Asset Creditors, agrees that it will raise no objection to such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing provided such use of cash collateral or DIP Financing meets the following requirement: the terms of the use of cash collateral or DIP Financing (A) do not compel the applicable Debtor to seek confirmation of a specific plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan for which all or substantially all of the material terms are set forth in the order authorizing such use of cash collateral, DIP Financing documentation or a related document, (B) do not expressly require the liquidation of the Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing documentation or the order authorizing the use of cash collateral, and (C) do not require that any lien of the Fixed Asset Security Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral be subordinated to or rank pari passu with any lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral securing such DIP Financing. To the extent the liens securing the ABL Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with the liens securing such DIP Financing which meets the requirement in the immediately preceding sentence, the Fixed Asset Security Agent will subordinate its liens on the ABL Collateral to the liens thereon securing such DIP Financing (and all obligations relating thereto) and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the ABL Security Agent or to the extent permitted in the manner set forth below). If, in connection with any cash collateral use or DIP Financing, any liens on the ABL Collateral held by the ABL Creditors are subject to a surcharge or are subordinated to an administrative priority claim, a professional fee ‘‘carve-out,’’ or fees owed to the United States Trustee, then the liens on the ABL Collateral of the Fixed Asset Creditors shall also be subordinated to such interest or claim and shall remain subordinated to the liens on the ABL Collateral of the ABL Creditors consistent with the other terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Security Agent and the holders of ABL Obligations will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to object to any use of cash collateral constituting Fixed Asset Collateral or to any DIP Financing to be secured at least in part by the Fixed Asset Collateral that has been consented to by the Fixed Asset Security Agent (acting on behalf of the Majority First Lien Creditors prior to the First Lien Discharge Date, and, thereafter, the Majority Second Lien Creditors) that meets comparable requirements as set forth above in this paragraph. In an insolvency or liquidation proceeding in the U.S., the provision of any DIP Financing that is secured by liens on Fixed Asset Collateral senior to or pari passu with the liens securing the First Lien Obligations or any consent to the use of cash collateral constituting Fixed Asset Collateral under section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code shall require only the consent of, prior to the First Lien Discharge Date, the Majority First Lien Creditors. _Automatic Stay_ Until the ABL Discharge Date, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, on behalf of itself and the Fixed Asset Creditors, agrees that none of them shall seek (or support any other person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the ABL Collateral, without the prior written consent of the ABL Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to seek relief from the automatic stay in respect of any Fixed Asset Collateral. _Sales_ Subject to certain other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Fixed Asset Security Agent will consent and will not object or oppose, or support any party in objecting to or opposing, a motion to dispose of any ABL Collateral free and clear of any liens or other claims under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), or any related motion to establish bidding procedures for such a sale or disposition, if (i) the ABL Security Agent and the requisite ABL Creditors shall have consented to such sale or disposition of such ABL Collateral, (ii) such motion does not impair, subject to the priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the rights of the 139 ----- Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors under Section 363(k) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any applicable bankruptcy law) (provided that the right of any Fixed Asset Creditor to offset its claim against the purchase price for any ABL Collateral exists only after the ABL Discharge Date), and (iii) the terms of any proposed order approving such transaction provide for the liens of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors on the ABL Collateral to attach to the proceeds of the ABL Collateral that is the subject of such disposition, subject to the lien priorities and the other terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to object to a sale or other disposition of any Fixed Asset Collateral (or any portion thereof). _Adequate Protection_ None of the Fixed Asset Security Agent nor the other Fixed Asset Creditors shall contest (or support any other person contesting) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (1) any request by the ABL Security Agent or the other ABL Creditors for adequate protection with respect to the ABL Collateral, provided (A) until last Discharge Date to occur in respect of any of the Fixed Asset Obligations (the ‘‘Fixed Asset Discharge Date’’) such request for adequate protection shall not seek the creation of any lien over additional assets or property of any Debtor other than with respect to assets or property that constitute ABL Collateral and (B) if such additional assets or property shall also constitute Fixed Asset Collateral, (i) a lien shall have been created in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent in respect of such Collateral and (ii) the lien thereon in favor of the ABL Creditors shall be subordinated to the extent set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, or (2) any objection by the ABL Security Agent or other ABL Creditor to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on the ABL Security Agent or other ABL Creditors claiming a lack of adequate protection; _provided that if the ABL Security Agent is granted adequate protection in the form of a lien on additional or replacement collateral, the Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors may seek or request adequate protection in the form of lien on such additional or replacement collateral; it being understood and agreed that (1) if such additional or replacement collateral shall also constitute Fixed Asset Collateral, the lien on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the ABL Security Agent shall be subordinate to all liens on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and (2) if such additional or replacement collateral shall also constitute ABL Collateral, the lien on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the ABL Security Agent shall be senior to all liens on such additional or replacement collateral in favor of the Fixed Asset Security Agent. The ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to contest any request of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors for adequate protection or any objection of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors to any motion, relief, action or proceeding for lack of adequate protection. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement or in connection with the exercise of remedies with respect to (i) the ABL Collateral, nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall limit the rights of the Fixed Asset Security Agent or the other Fixed Asset Creditors from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the Fixed Asset Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment, periodic cash payments or otherwise, other than from proceeds of the ABL Collateral) or (ii) the Fixed Asset Collateral, nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall limit the rights of the ABL Security Agent or the other ABL Creditors from seeking adequate protection with respect to their rights in the ABL Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including adequate protection in the form of a cash payment, periodic cash payments or otherwise, other than from proceeds of the Fixed Asset Collateral). 140 ----- _Post-petition Interest_ No Fixed Asset Security Agent nor any other Fixed Asset Creditor shall oppose or seek to challenge any claim by the ABL Security Agent or any other ABL Creditor for allowance in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of ABL Obligations consisting of interest, fees, expenses and other charges that, pursuant to the ABL Documents, continue to accrue after the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, whether or not such interest, fees, expenses and other charges are allowed or allowable under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any other applicable bankruptcy law) or in any such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, to the extent of the value of the lien securing any ABL Creditor’s claim, without regard to the existence of the lien of the Fixed Asset Security Agent on behalf of the Fixed Asset Creditors on the Collateral. The ABL Security Agent and the other ABL Creditors will agree to similar limitations with respect to their right to oppose or seek to challenge any comparable claim by the Fixed Asset Security Agent or any other Fixed Asset Creditor for post-petition interest, fees, expenses and other charges to the extent of the value of the lien securing any such Fixed Asset Creditor’s claim. _Certain Waivers_ The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, (i) waives any claim and objection it may have against any ABL Creditor arising out of the election of any ABL Creditor of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law) or out of any grant of a security interest in connection with the ABL Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (provided that any such grant of a security interest comports with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, including the provisions governing grant of security interests described under the headings ‘‘—Financing Matters’’ and ‘‘—Adequate Protection’’ above); (ii) agrees that it will not assert or enforce any claim under Section 506(c) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law) senior to or on parity with the Liens on the ABL Collateral securing the ABL Obligations; and (iii) agrees that it will not assert or enforce any claim against any ABL Creditor under the ‘‘equities of the case’’ exception of Section 552(b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law). The ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree to waive similar claims and objections with respect to the actions of any of the Fixed Asset Security Agent and any other Fixed Asset Creditors with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. _Separate Grants of Security and Separate Classification_ The Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, and the ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other ABL Creditors, will acknowledge and agree that the grants of liens pursuant to the ABL Security Documents, the Fixed Asset Security Documents in respect of the First Lien Obligations and any future Fixed Asset Security Documents in respect of the Second Lien Obligations constitute separate and distinct grants of liens, and because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the First Lien Obligations, the Second Lien Obligations and the ABL Obligations are fundamentally different and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed, or adopted in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other Fixed Asset Creditors, and the ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the other ABL Creditors, each agrees that the First Lien Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the ABL Creditors will vote as separate classes in connection with any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and that no Security Agent nor any Creditor will seek to vote with a Creditor of another class as a single class in connection with any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in this paragraph, if it is held that the claims of the First Lien Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the ABL Creditors in respect of the Collateral 141 ----- constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of secured claims subject to the relative lien priorities set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement), then the Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the Fixed Asset Creditors and the ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Creditors, will acknowledge and agree that, subject to certain other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, all distributions from the ABL Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Debtors in respect of the ABL Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the ABL Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the Fixed Asset Creditors), the ABL Creditors shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, expenses and other charges, including any additional interest payable pursuant to the ABL Documents, arising from or related to a default, whether or not a claim therefor is allowed as a claim in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution from the ABL Collateral is made in respect of the claims held by the Fixed Asset Creditors, with each Fixed Asset Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the applicable Fixed Asset Creditors, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the ABL Security Agent, for itself and on behalf of the ABL Creditors, amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the ABL Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the Fixed Asset Creditors). The ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors will agree to similar turnover provisions with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. The Fixed Asset Security Agent and the other Fixed Asset Creditors, on the one hand, and the ABL Security Agent and the ABL Creditors, on the other hand, shall retain the right to vote and otherwise act in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding (including the right to vote to accept or reject any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan) to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

(b) The Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior written consent of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the First Lien Notes Trustee and any other Representative of First Lien Obligations and (to the extent relating to the definition of ‘‘Security Enforcement Objective’’ or paragraph (a) above) the Majority Second Lien Creditors.

If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on an Interest Calculation Date, the Issuer will request the principal office of each of four major banks in the euro zone inter-bank market, as selected by the Issuer in consultation with the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on such Interest Calculation Date, to prime banks in the euro zone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in Euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer, in consultation with the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Interest Calculation Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in Euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. In the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes will be any successor rate generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of Euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith; provided that, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with an independent financial advisor, shall determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest (and any applicable adjustment spread to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR) on the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes; provided, further, that any such alternative basis adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall in all cases never be less than 0%. Following the adoption of an alternative basis pursuant to this paragraph, all references to ‘‘EURIBOR’’ in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative basis. The Issuer shall promptly thereafter notify the 166 ----- holders of the Senior Secured Euro Floating Rate Notes and (via an Officer’s Certificate) the Calculation Agent of the new rate replacing EURIBOR, and the Calculation Agent shall be entitled to rely on such (without liability to any Person) as sufficient evidence thereof. ‘‘euro-zone’’ means the region comprised of the member states of the European Union that at such time use the euro as their official currency. ‘‘Interest Calculation Date’’ means the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period in respect of the relevant Interest Period. ‘‘Interest Period’’ means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest Period shall commence on, and include, the Issue Date and end on, and exclude, 2019. ‘‘Representative Amount’’ means the greater of (i) A1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. ‘‘Reuters Page EURIBOR01’’ means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, Bloomberg page ‘‘EBF’’ or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). ‘‘TARGET Settlement Day’’ means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in Euro.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, ‘‘thin capitalization’’ rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders.

By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee.

If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of: (1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or (2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause (1) and (2), a ‘‘Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’’), will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the ‘‘Additional Amounts’’) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided, _however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_ (1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt, ownership, holding or disposition of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the Indenture or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee); (2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to do so; (3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior Secured Note for payment (where Senior Secured Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes and presentation is required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period); 181 ----- (4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee; (5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Tax; (6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’), as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder, or other official administrative interpretations thereof and any agreements entered into pursuant to current section 1471(b) of the Code, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version described above), and including (for the avoidance of doubt) any intergovernmental agreement (and any law, regulation or practice implementing any such intergovernmental agreement) in respect of the foregoing; or (7) any combination of the items (1) through (6) above. In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly. In addition, the Payor will pay, and reimburse each applicable Holder for, any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or other similar liabilities with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from (i) the execution, issuance, delivery or registration of the Senior Secured Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto, or (ii) the receipt of any payments under or with respect to, or enforcement of, the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any such taxes attributable to the receipt of payments, to any such taxes that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3), (5), or (6) above). The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or deduction, (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iii) upon written request, will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee (with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. 182 ----- Wherever in the Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes’’ there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Senior Secured Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organized, resident, or doing business for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571
509,Offerings 2019.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.13,Change of Control,60.13.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (equal to A100,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or $200,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) in principal amount or in integral multiples of A1,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or $1,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) in excess thereof; provided that Senior Secured Notes of A100,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Euro Notes) or $200,000 (with respect to the Senior Secured Dollar Notes) or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. 183 ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the ABL Facility that permits the ABL Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Secured Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation _on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be_ waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control. The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding. 184 ----- If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

If at any time the Senior Secured Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the ‘‘Reversion Date’’) and will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the Senior Secured Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no longer be in effect for such time that the Senior Secured Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Senior Secured Notes Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’ On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any Indebtedness Incurred under the ABL Facility) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on _Indebtedness.’’ On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be_ considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on _Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period._ 185 ----- Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in the first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on _Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during the Suspension_ Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted _Subsidiaries.’’ On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be_ permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant Senior Secured Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Secured Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders of the Senior Secured Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Notes directly.

509,Offerings 2019.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.12,Change of Control,61.12.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Notes as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Notes (equal to $200,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof; _provided that Senior Notes of $200,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ‘‘Change of Control Offer’’) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the 291 ----- SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchases or redeems the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the ABL Facility that permits the ABL Facility lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by their then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Senior Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Senior Notes and us. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation _on Indebtedness’’ and ‘‘Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.’’ Such restrictions in the Indenture can be_ waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under ‘‘Optional Redemption,’’ unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control. The definition of ‘‘Change of Control’’ includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ‘‘substantially all,’’ there is no precise established definition of such phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ‘‘all or substantially all’’ of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. 292 ----- The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding. If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent that the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the Reversion Date is referred to as the ‘‘Suspension Period.’’ On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any Indebtedness Incurred under the ABL Facility) will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(a) of the second paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on _Indebtedness.’’ On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created during the Suspension Period will be_ 293 ----- considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on _Restricted Payments’’ will be made as though the covenants described under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments’’ had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period._ Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under ‘‘—Limitation on Restricted Payments.’’ On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.’’ Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in the first paragraph of ‘‘—Limitation on _Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries’’ that becomes effective during the Suspension_ Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under ‘‘—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted _Subsidiaries.’’ On and after each Reversion Date, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be_ permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period. In addition, any future obligation to grant further Senior Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligation to grant Senior Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date. There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status. The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Senior Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings of the Senior Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders of the Senior Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date.

The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants.

DTC participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations such as the Initial Purchasers. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and clearing corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants. Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

Prior to the Completion Date, the Company will not be able to cause the Ardagh Carve-out Business or Exal to comply with the covenants described in this ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ or other agreements under the Indenture. As such, we cannot assure you that prior to the Completion Date, the Ardagh Carve-out Business or Exal will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Indenture had those covenants or other agreements been applicable to such entities as of the Issue Date, and any such non-compliance will not constitute a default or Event of Default under the Indenture. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Combination—Trivium may have liabilities that we are unaware of.’’ The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes will be issued in this offering. We may, subject to applicable law and the terms of the Indenture, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Notes (the ‘‘Additional Senior Notes’’) provided that if the Additional Senior Notes are not fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Senior Notes, such Additional Senior Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code, and/or CUSIP from the Notes originally issued.

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the relevant security agent. See ‘‘Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement’’ for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._ This ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes’’ is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Notes and the Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Charge.

This summary is not a comprehensive or complete description of all the Dutch tax considerations that may be relevant for a particular holder of Notes and it does not address the tax consequences that may arise in any jurisdiction other than The Netherlands in connection with the acquisition, ownership and transfer of the notes. For Dutch tax purposes, a holder of Notes may include an individual who or an entity that does not have the legal title to the Notes, but to whom nevertheless the Notes, or the income thereof, are attributed based either on such individual or entity holding a beneficial interest in the Notes or based on specific statutory provisions. This summary is based on the tax laws of The Netherlands as in effect on the date of this offering memorandum, including regulations, rulings and decisions of its taxing and other authorities available in printed form on or before this date and now in effect, in each case as applied and interpreted by Dutch courts, without prejudice to any developments or amendments introduced at a later date and implemented with or without retroactive effect.

Generally a holder of Notes will have a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in the Issuer if he holds, alone or, in case the holder is an individual, together with his partner (statutorily defined term in Dutch tax law), whether directly or indirectly, the ownership of, or certain other rights over, shares representing 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares) of the Issuer, or rights to acquire shares, whether or not already issued, that represent at any time 5% or more of the total issued and outstanding capital (or the issued and outstanding capital of any class of shares) of the Issuer, or the ownership of certain profit participating certificates that relate to 5% or more of the annual profit or to 5% or more of the liquidation proceeds of the Issuer (a ‘‘Substantial Interest’’). A holder of Notes may also have a Substantial Interest in the Issuer if one of certain relatives of that holder or of his partner has a Substantial Interest in the Issuer. If a holder of Notes does not have a Substantial Interest, a deemed Substantial Interest will be present if (part of) a Substantial Interest has been disposed of, or is deemed to have been disposed of, without recognizing a taxable gain. _Dutch Resident Individuals_ A holder of Notes who is an individual and who is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Individual’’), will generally be subject to Dutch income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes at the progressive rates up to 51.75% (maximum rate for 2019) if: (i) the holder derives profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur (ondernemer) or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder), to which enterprise the Notes are attributable or deemed to be attributable; or (ii) the holder derives income or capital gains from the Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities’ (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden, as defined in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001)), which include the performance of activities with respect to the Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, _actief vermogensbeheer) and also include benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief belang)._ 388 ----- If neither condition (i) nor condition (ii) mentioned above applies, a Dutch Resident Individual will generally be subject to Dutch income tax on a deemed return, regardless of the actual income or capital gains derived from the Notes. This deemed return is calculated by applying the applicable deemed return percentage(s) to the individual’s yield basis (rendementsgrondslag), insofar as this exceeds a certain threshold (heffingsvrij vermogen). The individual’s yield basis is determined as the fair market value of certain qualifying assets (including, as the case may be, the Notes) held by the Dutch Resident Individual less the fair market value of certain qualifying liabilities, both determined on January 1 of the relevant year. The deemed return percentages to be applied to the yield basis increases progressively from 1.94% to 5.60% (2019 deemed return percentages), depending on such individual’s yield basis. The deemed return percentages will be adjusted annually. The deemed return will be taxed at a rate of 30% (rate for 2019). _Dutch Resident Entities_ A holder of Notes that is an entity and that is resident or deemed to be resident in The Netherlands for purposes of Dutch taxation (a ‘‘Dutch Resident Entity’’), will generally be subject to Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes. The Dutch corporate income tax rate is 19% for the first A200,000 of the taxable amount and 25% of the taxable amount exceeding A200,000 (rates for 2019). _Non-Dutch Residents_ A holder of Notes who is not, nor deemed to be, a Dutch Resident Individual or a Dutch Resident Entity (a ‘‘Non-Dutch Resident’’), is generally not subject to Dutch income tax or Dutch corporate income tax with respect to income and capital gains derived from the Notes, provided that: (i) such Non-Dutch Resident does not derive profits from an enterprise or deemed enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net worth of such enterprise (other than as an entrepreneur or a shareholder) which enterprise is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment (vaste inrichting) or a permanent representative (vaste _vertegenwoordiger) in The Netherlands and to which enterprise or part of an enterprise, as the_ case may be, the Notes are attributable or deemed attributable; (ii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual does not derive income or capital gains from the Notes, as the case may be, that are taxable as benefits from ‘miscellaneous activities performed in The Netherlands’ (resultaat uit overage werkzaamheden in Nederland, as defined in The Netherlands Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001)), which include the performance of activities in respect of the Notes, that exceed regular, active portfolio management (normaal, actief vermogensbeheer) and also includes benefits resulting from a lucrative interest (lucratief belang); (iii) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident who is an individual, such individual is not entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities or through an employment relationship, to which enterprise the Notes or payments in respect of the Notes are attributable; and (iv) in case of a Non-Dutch Resident that is an entity, such entity is neither entitled to a share in the profits of an enterprise nor co-entitled to the net worth of an enterprise effectively managed in The Netherlands, other than by way of the holding of securities, to which enterprise the Notes or payments in respect of the Notes are attributable. 389 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

A U.S. Holder who uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and who receives a payment of stated interest in Euro (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note) will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the Euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that time. A cash basis U.S. Holder will not realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the Euro received. A U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will accrue euro-denominated stated interest income in euro and translate that amount into U.S. dollars based on the average spot rate of exchange in effect for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within the applicable taxable year. Alternatively, an accrual method U.S. Holder may elect to translate stated interest income received in euro into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period (or, in the case of a partial accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the last day of such partial accrual period) or, if the date of receipt is within five business days of the last day of the interest accrual period, the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A U.S. Holder that makes this election must apply it consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot change the election without the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ‘‘IRS’’). A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued euro-denominated stated interest income on the date the interest payment (or proceeds from a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest) is actually received. The amount of foreign currency exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of stated interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss generally will be treated, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source ordinary income or loss, and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. For most U.S. Holders, interest income with respect to the Notes will constitute ‘‘passive category’’ income, which may be relevant in calculating the U.S. Holder’s foreign tax credit limitation.

The amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note is disposed of; provided, however, that if the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. If a Note is not traded on an established securities market (or, if a Note is so traded, but a U.S. Holder is an accrual basis taxpayer that has not made the settlement date election), a U.S. Holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss not treated as interest income or expense) to the extent that the U.S. dollar value of the euro received (based on the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date) differs from the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized. Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, any gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the disposition of a Note will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the Note has been held for more than one year at the time of the disposition of the Note. For certain non-corporate holders (including individuals), any such long-term capital gain is subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss not treated as interest income or expense. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates generally will equal the difference, if any, between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note is disposed of, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price for the Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the Note was acquired (or, in each case, determined on the settlement date if the Notes are traded on an established securities market and the holder is either a cash basis or an electing accrual basis holder). Payments received that are attributable to accrued interest will be treated in accordance with the rules applicable to payments of interest described above. Any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued interest) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note.

It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase the Notes. In particular, this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to U.S. Holders that may be subject to special tax rules including, without limitation, the following: (i) banks or other financial institutions; (ii) insurance companies; (iii) dealers or traders in securities or currencies; (iv) tax exempt entities; (v) persons who will hold Notes as part of a “hedging” or “conversion” transaction or as a position in a “straddle” or as part of a “synthetic security” or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (vi) U.S. Holders who have a “functional currency” other 390 ----- than the U.S. dollar; (vii) regulated investment companies; (viii) partnerships and other pass-through entities or arrangements (and investors therein); (ix) persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States; (x) U.S. Holders who hold Notes through a non-U.S. broker or other non-U.S. intermediary; and (xi) persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an ‘‘applicable financial statement’’ (as defined in Section 451 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ‘‘Code’’)). Further, this summary does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any U.S. federal tax consequences other than U.S. federal income tax consequences (such as, U.S. federal estate and gift tax consequences, or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) or any U.S. state and local or foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of Notes. This summary is based on the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. All of the foregoing are subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and could affect the tax consequences described below. For purposes of this summary, a ‘‘U.S. Holder’’ is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) the trust was in existence on August 20, 1996 and has properly elected to continue to be treated as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in or owner of the partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement generally will depend upon the status of the partner or owner and the activities of the entity. A person that is a partner in a partnership or other pass-through entity or arrangement that is considering investing in Notes should consult its own tax adviser. Each prospective investor should consult its own tax adviser with respect to the U.S. federal (including income, Medicare, estate and gift), state, local and foreign tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of Notes. Holders should also review the discussion under ‘‘Netherlands Taxation’’ for the Dutch tax consequences to a holder of the ownership of Notes. In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated principal on the Notes or retire the Notes before their stated maturity dates. See, e.g., ‘‘Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control’’ and ‘‘Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control.’’ Notwithstanding these possibilities, we do not believe that the Notes are contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and, consequently, we do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments. If, notwithstanding our view, any of the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, a U.S. Holder generally would be required to accrue ordinary income at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate on such Notes and to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of such Notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion assumes that the Notes will be issued with no more than a _de minimis amount of original issue discount (‘‘OID’’) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This will be the case if the excess, if any, of the Notes’ stated principal amount over their issue price is less than .25% of the Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years from the issue date to maturity.

The Parent Guarantor and certain of the Post-Completion Date Guarantors of the Notes are incorporated under the laws of one of British Columbia (Canada), Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Furthermore, most of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and such Guarantors live outside the United States. Substantially all of the assets of Trivium Packaging Finance B.V. and the Guarantors (other than the Post-Completion Date Guarantors in Delaware and Ohio (United States)), and substantially all of the assets of their directors and executive officers, are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve process on such persons in the United States or to enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States. In addition, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish counsel have informed us that it is questionable whether an Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in Denmark, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Poland or Spain predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against any Issuer, the Parent Guarantor, any Post-Completion Date Guarantor, or any of their respective directors or executive officers, investors will need to enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the relevant company or individual has assets. We have been advised by counsel that there is doubt that a foreign judgment based upon United States federal or state securities laws would be enforced in British Columbia (Canada), Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, The Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not based on United States federal or state securities laws, would not be automatically enforceable in such countries. You should consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation,332.30.1,,"The unaudited combined interim financial statements of the Business have been prepared on a carve-out basis from the consolidated interim financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A., to represent the financial position and performance of the Business as if the Business had existed on a stand-alone basis for each of the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 for the combined income statements, statements of comprehensive income and statements of cash flows and as at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 for the combined statements of financial position. However, the unaudited combined interim financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if the Business had been a stand alone entity during the periods presented. After making enquiries and considering the Business’ projections in the long range plan, Management consider that the Business has adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future, for this reason the unaudited combined interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The unaudited combined interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ (‘‘IAS 34’’). They do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the combined financial statements of the Business for the year ended December 31, 2018 which were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’). In preparing these unaudited combined interim financial statements, the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the changes in accounting policies set out below. The significant judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies of the Business and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the preparation of the combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, except in regard to recognition of the income tax charge, as described below, where the guidance contained in IAS 34 for interim financial statements has been followed.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued),332.31.1,,"The unaudited combined interim financial statements are presented in U.S. dollar, rounded to the nearest million, and have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following: - derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value; and - employee benefit obligations are measured at the present value of the future estimated cash flows related to benefits earned and pension assets valued at fair value. The preparation of unaudited combined interim financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying accounting policies, which have been applied consistently through the unaudited combined interim financial statements of the Business. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are subject to continual re-evaluation. These estimates, assumptions and judgments were historically deemed to be reasonable and prudent. However, actual outcomes may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the unaudited combined interim financial statements, are discussed in the critical accounting estimates and judgments. The unaudited combined interim financial statements have been prepared by aggregating financial information from the components of the Business, as described in note 1, together with assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the Business including related party borrowings, and direct and indirect costs and expenses related to the operations of the Business. The following summarizes the principles applied in preparing the unaudited combined interim financial statements: - Controlled companies that are part of the Business and were acquired or disposed of during the financial periods presented have been included in the unaudited combined interim financial statements from and up to the date control was passed. Goodwill, customer relationship intangible assets and fair value adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition of the controlled companies that are part of the Business by Ardagh, have been included in the unaudited combined interim financial statements; - The Business did not in the past form a separate legal group and therefore it is not possible to show issued share capital or a full analysis of reserves. The net assets of the Business are represented by the cumulative investment of Ardagh in the Business, shown as invested capital; - Certain intercompany balances between Ardagh and the Business are deemed to be long term funding in nature and have been presented as part of invested capital in the unaudited combined interim financial statements; - All intercompany balances, investments in subsidiaries and share capital within the Business have been eliminated upon combination in the unaudited combined interim financial statements; - All employee benefit obligations are directly attributable to the Business and are obligations of the combined entities; F-9 ----- - Cumulative translation differences directly attributable to the controlled companies that are part of the Business, have been allocated at the amounts included in Ardagh’s consolidated financial statements; - Ardagh operates a central treasury function. Interest on related party borrowings and allocated costs and expenses as described below have generally been deemed to have been paid by the Business to Ardagh in the year in which the costs were incurred. In addition, all external debt used to fund Ardagh’s operations is managed and held centrally. Related party borrowings and accrued interest payable to Ardagh, representing certain components of the Ardagh Group’s corporate debt, is included in the unaudited combined interim financial statements reflecting the debt obligation and related interest costs of the Business; - For the purposes of the preparation of these unaudited combined interim financial statements, shared corporate head office and divisional costs attributable to the Business have been included in selling, general and administration (‘‘SGA’’) expenses, based primarily on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, head count and IT users as deemed appropriate, with settlement of these costs recorded within invested capital. The allocation to the Business reflects all the costs of doing business and Management believes that the allocation is reasonable. The support functions provided to the Business by Ardagh include the following categories: a) Centralized support functions; b) Information technology; c) Finance, tax and treasury; d) Board; and e) Other. The amounts for each of these functions within the unaudited combined interim financial statements are set out below: full financial year as required by IAS 34. Tax charges and credits and balances in the unaudited combined interim financial statements have been calculated as if the Business was a separate taxable entity using the separate return method. The tax charges and credits recorded in the unaudited combined income statement and tax balances recorded in the unaudited combined interim statement of financial position have been affected by the taxation arrangements within Ardagh, and are not necessarily representative of the positions that may arise in the future. Differences between the tax charges and credits and balances in the unaudited combined interim financial statements, and the tax charges and credits and balances in the historical records of the Business are included in invested capital. - Ardagh has historically assessed and managed the hedging risks and arrangements of the Business centrally. The derivatives used in hedging transactions and relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. In the unaudited combined interim financial statements the hedging arrangements entered into by the Business have been reflected based on Ardagh’s previous arrangements and are not necessarily representative of the hedging arrangements that may arise in the future. The unaudited combined interim financial statements are authorized for issuance on June 13, 2019. Business is party to and have designed and implemented a system solution and business process, with appropriate internal controls applied, in order to meet the new accounting and disclosure requirements post-adoption. The Business leases various types of assets, with lease terms being negotiated on an individual basis and subject to a wide range of different terms and conditions. Extension options or periods after termination options have been considered by management if it is reasonably certain that the lease is extended or not terminated. The principal impact on the unaudited combined interim financial statement of financial position as at the adoption date of January 1, 2019, were an increase in property, plant and equipment of $67 million due to the recognition of right-of-use assets, and an increase in borrowings, as lease liabilities of $75 million were recognized based on the new treatment. As a result of the aforementioned impacts, deferred tax assets increased by $2 million. Cash generated from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019, increased by $4 million due to certain lease expenses no longer being recognized as operating cash outflows following the adoption of IFRS 16, however this is principally offset by a corresponding increase in cash used in financing activities due to repayments of the principal on lease liabilities. In addition to the above impact, the adoption of IFRS 16 also had an impact on the unaudited combined interim income statement and certain of the Business’ key financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges recognized in the unaudited combined interim income statement. The application of the new standard decreased both cost of sales and operating costs (excluding depreciation) in the income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted EBITDA for the three month ended March 31, 2019 of $5 million, offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and net finance expense. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities recognized upon adoption of IFRS 16 was 5.4%. The total lease liability recognized at January 1, 2019 reconciles as follows to the total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases disclosed by the Business as of December 31, 2018: The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows related to the lease liabilities of the Business as of March 31, 2019 is as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that appropriately represents those transactions. This information provides a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that leases have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17, ‘Leases’ (‘‘IAS 17’’), and later interpretations including IFRIC 4, ‘Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease’ (‘‘IFRIC 4’’), and has resulted in the majority of the operating leases held by the Business being recognized on the combined statement of financial position. Under IFRS 16, at the lease commencement date, the Business recognizes a lease liability as the present value of expected future lease payments, excluding any amounts which are variable based on the usage of the underlying asset and a right-of-use asset generally at the same amount plus any directly attributable costs. The Business adopted IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019 applying the simplified approach, with the right-of-use assets being calculated as if IFRS 16 had always been applied and the lease liabilities being calculated as the present value of expected future lease payments, which resulted in the Business retaining prior period figures as reported under the previous standards and recognizing the cumulative effect of applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to invested capital as at the date of initial adoption. Upon adoption, the Business has availed of the practical expedients to use hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease and has also elected not to apply IFRS 16 to contracts that were not identified before as containing a lease under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The Business has made an accounting policy election to combine lease and non-lease components. The Business has completed its assessment and adopted IFRS 16 as of its January 1, 2019 effective date. This involved the establishment of a cross-functional project team to implement the new standard.

The requirement in IFRS 1 to provide reconciliations of financial information prepared under legacy GAAP to IFRS is not relevant to the Business as the Business has not previously prepared or reported any financial statements in accordance with any other generally accepted accounting principles and has availed of the exemptions available under IFRS 1 for a subsidiary becoming a first-time adopter later than its parent.

Summary of significant accounting policies (Continued),332.108.1,,"foreseeable future, for this reason the combined financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The combined financial statements, are presented in U.S. dollar, rounded to the nearest million, and have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following: - derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value; and - employee benefit obligations are measured at the present value of the future estimated cash flows related to benefits earned and pension assets valued at fair value. The preparation of combined financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. It also requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying accounting policies, which have been applied consistently through the combined financial statements of the Business. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are subject to continual re-evaluation. These estimates, assumptions and judgments were historically deemed to be reasonable and prudent. However, actual outcomes may differ from those estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the combined financial statements, are discussed in the critical accounting estimates and judgments. The combined financial statements have been prepared by aggregating financial information from the components of the Business, as described in note 1 and comprises the entities described in note 23, together with assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that management has determined are specifically attributable to the Business including related party borrowings, and direct and indirect costs and expenses related to the operations of the Business. The following summarizes the principles applied in preparing the combined financial statements: - Controlled companies that are part of the Business and were acquired or disposed of during the financial periods presented have been included in the combined financial statements from and up to the date control was passed. Goodwill, customer relationship intangible assets and fair value adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition of the controlled companies that are part of the Business by Ardagh, have been included in the combined financial statements; - The Business did not in the past form a separate legal group and therefore it is not possible to show issued share capital or a full analysis of reserves. The net assets of the Business are represented by the cumulative investment of Ardagh in the Business, shown as invested capital; - Certain intercompany balances between Ardagh and the Business are deemed to be long term funding in nature and have been presented as part of invested capital in the combined financial statements; - All intercompany balances, investments in subsidiaries and share capital within the Business have been eliminated upon combination in the combined financial statements; - All employee benefit obligations are directly attributable to the Business and are obligations of the entities described in note 2; F-29 ----- - Cumulative translation differences directly attributable to the controlled companies that are part of the Business, have been allocated at the amounts included in Ardagh’s consolidated financial statements; - Ardagh operates a central treasury function. Interest on related party borrowings and allocated costs and expenses as described below have generally been deemed to have been paid by the Business to Ardagh in the year in which the costs were incurred. In addition, all external debt used to fund Ardagh’s operations is managed and held centrally. Related party borrowings and accrued interest payable to Ardagh, representing certain components of the Ardagh Group’s corporate debt, is included in the combined financial statements reflecting the debt obligation and related interest costs of the Business; - For the purposes of the preparation of these combined financial statements, shared corporate head office and divisional costs attributable to the Business have been included in selling, general and administration (‘‘SGA’’) expenses, based primarily on revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, head count and IT users as deemed appropriate, with settlement of these costs recorded within invested capital. The allocation to the Business reflects all the costs of doing business and Management believes that the allocation is reasonable. The support functions provided to the Business by Ardagh include the following categories: a) Centralized support functions; b) Information technology; c) Finance, tax and treasury; d) Board; and e) Other. The amounts for each of these functions within the combined financial statements are set out below: are not necessarily representative of the positions that may arise in the future. Differences between the tax charges and credits and balances in the combined financial statements, and the tax charges and credits and balances in the historical records of the Business are included in invested capital. - Ardagh has historically assessed and managed the hedging risks and arrangements of the Business centrally, as outlined in note 16. The derivatives used in hedging transactions and relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items and are detailed in note 17. In the combined financial statements the hedging arrangements entered into by the Business have been reflected based on Ardagh’s previous arrangements and are not necessarily representative of the hedging arrangements that may arise in the future. The combined financial statements are authorized for issuance on June 13, 2019. of sales and operating costs (excluding depreciation) in the combined income statement, giving rise to an increase in underlying Adjusted EBITDA, but this will be largely offset by corresponding increases in depreciation and finance expenses, and hence the expected impact on the profit for the year will not be material for the Business. The operating lease cost for the year ended December 31, 2018 is set out in note 9 and it is the expectation of the Business that a significant portion of those operating lease costs will be reclassified in the combined income statement upon adoption of IFRS 16, subject to changes in exchange rates when compared to the euro functional currency. The IFRS Interpretations Committee issued IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over income tax treatments’, which clarifies how the recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’, are applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. IFRIC 23 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. It is not expected that the application of this interpretation will have a material impact on the combined financial statements of the Business. (iii) Transactions eliminated on combination Transactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses on transactions between the controlled companies of the Business are eliminated on combination. The accounting policies of the controlled companies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Business. acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred and included in sales, general and administration expenses. When the Business makes an acquisition, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. Any contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to those groups of cash-generating units (‘‘CGUs’’) that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose for the purpose of assessing impairment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment. Where goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained. (ii) Customer relationships Customer relationships acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Customer relationships have a finite useful economic life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization. (iii) Technology Technology based intangibles acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date and reflect the ability of the Business to add value through accumulated technological expertise surrounding product and process development and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization. (iv) Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs relating to new products are capitalized if the new product is technically and commercially feasible. All other development costs are expensed as incurred. (iii) Subsequent costs The Business recognizes in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment, the cost of replacing the component of such an item when that cost is incurred, if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied with the item will flow to the Business and the replacement cost of the item can be measured reliably. When a component is replaced the old component is de-recognized in the period. All other costs are recognized in the combined income statement as an expense as incurred. When a major overhaul is performed, its cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria above are met. (iv) Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the combined income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 - 40 years Plant and machinery . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 40 years Office equipment and vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 10 years Assets’ useful lives and residual values are adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. them to their current location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes direct materials, direct labor and attributable overheads based on normal operating capacity. Net realizable value is the estimated proceeds of sale less all further costs to completion, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Spare parts which are deemed to be of a consumable nature, are included within inventories and expensed when utilized. Short term bank deposits of greater than three months’ maturity which do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents are classified as financial assets within current assets and stated at amortized cost. Restricted cash comprises cash held by the Business but which is ring-fenced and to which the Business does not have unfettered access. Restricted cash is measured at amortized cost. (iv) Borrowings (including related party borrowings) Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognized in the combined income statement of the Business over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Business has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. (v) Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in invested capital is immediately transferred to the combined income statement. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in financial and actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to invested capital in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the combined income statement. (ii) Multi-employer pension plans Multi-employer craft or industry based pension schemes (‘‘multi-employer schemes’’) have arrangements similar to those of defined benefit schemes. In each case, however, it is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the multi-employer schemes of the Business and therefore, in accordance with IAS 19(R), the Business has taken the exemption to account for multiemployer pension schemes as defined contribution schemes recognizing the contributions payable in each period in the combined income statement. (iii) Other end of service employee benefits In a number of countries, the Business pays lump sums to employees leaving service. These arrangements are accounted for in the same manner as defined benefit pension plans. (iv) Other long term employee benefits The obligation of the Business in respect of other long term employee benefit plans represents the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for service in the current and prior periods for partial retirement contracts and long service awards. These are included in the category of employee benefit obligations on the combined statement of financial position. The obligation is computed on the basis of the projected unit credit method and is discounted to present value using a discount rate equating to the market yield at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and estimated term of the obligations. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in full in the other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. (v) Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Business pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense when they are due. The Business is a leading supplier of sustainable innovative, value-added rigid metal packaging solutions. The global packaging industry is a large, consumer-driven industry with stable growth characteristics. The Business operates in the metal sector and our principal target regions are Europe and North America. We derive approximately 93% of our revenues in Europe and North America, mature markets characterized by predictable consumer spending, stable supply and demand and low cyclicality. Our products are metal containers, primarily for food & speciality markets, which are characterized by stable, consumer-driven demand. We serve over 1,200 customers across more than 70 countries, comprised of multi-national companies, large national and regional companies and small local businesses. In our principal target regions of Europe and North America, our customers include a wide variety of consumerpackaged goods companies, which own some of the best-known brands in the world. We have a stable customer base with longstanding relationships. A significant portion of our sales volumes are supplied under framework arrangements which include input cost pass-through provisions, which help us deliver generally consistent margins. The Business usually enters into framework agreements with its customers, which establish the terms under which individual orders to purchase goods or services may be placed. As the framework agreements do not identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred, they do not create enforceable rights and obligations on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, the Business has concluded that only individual purchase orders create enforceable rights and obligations and meet the definition of a contract in IFRS 15. The individual purchase orders have, in general, a duration of one year or less and, as such, the Business does not disclose any information about remaining performance obligations under these contracts. The payment terms of the Business are in line with customary business practice, which can vary by customer and region. The Business has availed of the practical expedient from considering the existence of a significant financing component as, based on past experience, we expect that, at contract inception, the period between when a promised good is transferred to the customer and when the customer pays for that good will be one year or less. Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service has transferred to the customer. For certain contracts, the Business manufactures products for customers that have no alternative use and for which the Business has an enforceable right to payment for production completed to date. Therefore, the Business will recognize revenue over time as the contractual performance obligations are satisfied for those contracts. For all other contracts, the Business will continue to recognize revenue primarily on dispatch of the goods, net of any related customer rebates, cash discounts and value added taxes. to be appropriate in the combined income statement as it provides useful additional information and is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by the Business. Exceptional restructuring costs are classified as restructuring provisions and all other exceptional costs when outstanding at the balance sheet date are classified as exceptional items payable. Differences between the tax charges and credits in the combined financial statements and the tax charges and credits in the historical records of the Business are included as offset in invested capital. which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Business recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit matters based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. (iv) Measurement of employee benefit obligations The Business follows guidance of IAS 19(R) to determine the present value of its obligations to current and past employees in respect of defined benefit pension obligations, other long term employee benefits, and other end of service employee benefits which are subject to similar fluctuations in value in the long term. The Business values its liabilities, with the assistance of professional actuaries, to ensure consistency in the quality of the key assumptions underlying the valuations. The critical assumptions and estimates applied are discussed in detail in note 18. (v) Exceptional items The combined income statement and segment analysis separately identify results before exceptional items. Exceptional items are those that in our judgment need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. The Business believes that this presentation provides additional analysis as it highlights exceptional items. The determination of ‘‘significant’’ as included in our definition uses qualitative and quantitative factors which remain consistent from period to period. The Business uses judgment in assessing the particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature, are disclosed in the combined income statement and related notes as exceptional items. Management considers the combined income statement presentation of exceptional items to be appropriate as it provides useful additional information and is consistent with the way that financial information is measured by and presented to management. In that regard, management believes it to be consistent with paragraph 85 of IAS 1 ‘‘Presentation of financial statements’’ (‘‘IAS 1’’), which permits the inclusion of line items and subtotals that improve the understanding of performance. (vi) Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service has transferred to the customer. For certain contracts, the Business manufactures products for customers that have no alternative use and for which the Business has an enforceable right to payment for production completed to date. The determination of goods or contracts having no alternative use and the enforceable right to payment involves and relies upon management judgment, and can result in the Business accelerating the recognition of revenue over time as the Business satisfies the contractual performance obligations for those contracts. (vii) Business combinations and goodwill Goodwill only arises in business combinations. The amount of goodwill initially recognized is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s judgment. Allocation of the purchase price affects the results of the Business as finite lived intangible assets are amortized, whereas indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized and could result in differing amortization charges based on the allocation to indefinite lived and finite lived intangible assets.

The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information in a manner that appropriately represents those transactions. This information provides a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that leases have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17, ‘Leases’, and later interpretations, and will result in the majority of the operating leases held by the Business being recognized on the combined statement of financial position. The Business has completed an assessment of the impact of IFRS 16, involving the establishment of a cross-functional project team to implement the new standard from January 1, 2019. The Business has gathered and assessed the data relating to approximately 800 leases to which the Business is party, and have designed and implemented a system solution and business process, with appropriate internal controls applied, in order to meet the new accounting and disclosure requirements post-adoption. The Business will adopt IFRS 16 by applying the modified retrospective approach, with the right-of-use assets being calculated as if IFRS 16 had always been applied, and avail of the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components. We expect that the adoption of IFRS 16 will have a significant impact on the combined statement of financial position and combined statement of cash flows as follows: - an increase in non-current assets due to the recognition of right-of-use assets in the range of $60 million to $70 million; - an increase in financial liabilities as lease liabilities are recognized based on the new treatment in the range of $75 million to $80 million; and - cash generated from operations is expected to increase due to certain lease expenses no longer being recognized as operating cash outflows, however this is expected to be offset by a corresponding increase in cash used in financing activities due to repayments of the principal on lease liabilities. In addition to the above impact, the adoption of IFRS 16 will also have an impact on the combined income statement and certain key financial metrics as a result of changes in the classification of charges recognized in the combined income statement.

The companies included in these combined financial statements are all entities over which the Business has control. The Business controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of controlled companies by the Business. The cost of an acquisition is the consideration given in exchange for control of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired legal entities. Directly attributable transaction costs are expensed and included as exceptional items within sales, general and administration expenses. The acquired net assets are initially measured at fair value. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the acquired legal entity in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the legal entity operates (the ‘‘functional currency’’). If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the share of the net assets of the legal entity acquired by the Business, the difference is recognized directly in the combined income statement. The Business considers obligations of the acquiree in a business combination that arise as a result of the change in control, to be cash flows arising from obtaining control of the controlled company, and classifies these obligations as investing activities in the combined statement of cash flows. (ii) Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the equity of a controlled company which is not attributable to the Business.

The Business applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below. (i) Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognized initially at fair value and are, thereafter, measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method less any provision for impairment, in accordance with the held to collect business model. A provision for impairment of specific trade receivables is recognized by the Business when there is evidence of increased credit risk in comparison to the original terms of the receivables. For all other trade receivables, the Business uses an allowance matrix to measure the expected credit loss, based on historical actual credit loss experiences, adjusted for forward-looking information. The Business participates in certain uncommitted accounts receivable factoring and related programs with various financial institutions for certain receivables, accounted for as true sales of receivables, without recourse to the Business. The Business has a selling business model related to those receivables and, as such, any unsold receivables under such programs are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.

For cash flow hedges which subsequently result in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve within invested capital are reclassified to the asset in order to adjust its carrying value. Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve, or as adjustments to carrying value of non-financial assets, are recycled to the combined income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the combined income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing at that time remains within invested capital in equity and is recognized in the combined income statement when the forecast cash flow arises.

Fair value related disclosures for financial instruments and pension assets that are measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed, are summarized in the following notes: - Disclosures for valuation methods, significant estimates and assumptions (notes 17 and 18) - Quantitative disclosures of fair value measurement hierarchy (note 17) - Financial instruments (including those carried at amortized cost) (note 17) Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: - in the principal market for the asset or liability; or - in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Business. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Business uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The liability recognized in the combined statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.

Income tax is recognized in the combined income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred income tax is recognized, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the combined financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are generally not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill and deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realized or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred income tax liabilities where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Business and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

The Business makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. (i) Estimated impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets In accordance with IAS 36 ‘‘Impairment of assets’’ (‘‘IAS 36’’), the Business tests whether goodwill and other long lived assets have suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policies stated. The determination of the recoverable amounts of goodwill requires the use of estimates as outlined in note 8. The judgments made by the Business relating to the impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets are included in notes 8 and 9. (ii) Establishing lives for the purposes of depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangibles Long lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment, customer intangibles and technology intangibles, comprise a significant portion of the total assets of the Business. The annual depreciation and amortization charges depend primarily on the estimated lives of each type of asset and, in certain circumstances, estimates of fair values and residual values. The Board regularly review these asset lives and change them as necessary to reflect current thinking on remaining lives in light of technological change, prospective economic utilization and physical condition of the assets concerned. Changes in asset lives can have a significant impact on the depreciation and amortization charges for the period. It is not practical to quantify the impact of changes in asset lives on an overall basis, as asset lives are individually determined and there are a significant number of asset lives in use.

Income tax (Continued),332.168.1,,"Profit before tax in the combined financial statements of the Business is multiplied by the standard rate of Luxembourg corporation tax, consistent with the presentation in the consolidated financial statements of Ardagh Group S.A. The total income tax charge outlined above for each year includes tax credits of $4 million in 2018 (2017: $14 million; 2016: $7 million) in respect of exceptional items, being the tax effect of the items set out in note 4. The $14 million exceptional income tax credit recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a credit of $6 million on remeasurement of deferred tax positions following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (‘‘TCJA’’) in the United States of America. Tax credits relating to the re-measurement of deferred tax positions of $4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to the progressive reduction in the French corporate income tax rate, which will apply when the existing temporary differences reverse, from 33.33% to 28%. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into U.S. law. On re-measurement of the Business’ deferred tax positions following the enactment of the TCJA, a one-time non-cash benefit of $6 million was recorded to the income statement of the year ended December 31, 2017. This credit reflects a reduction in the U.S. net deferred tax liability of the Business due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, which will apply when the existing temporary differences reverse, from the existing rate of 35% to 21% with effect from January 1, 2018. The additional tax credit on re-measurement of deferred tax positions of $3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 is attributable to the further progressive reduction in the French corporate income tax rate, which will apply when the existing temporary differences reverse, from 28% to 25%. Tax credits relating to the re-measurement of deferred tax positions of $4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 is attributable to the progressive reduction in the Dutch corporate income tax rate, which will apply when the existing temporary differences reverse, from 25% to 20.5%.

The budget and forecast results were then extended for a further two-year period (2017: four-year period; 2016: three-year period; 2015: three-year period) making certain assumptions including that long-term capital expenditure equals depreciation and that any increase in input cost will be passed through to customers, in line with historic practice and contractual terms. The terminal value assumed long-term growth in line with long-term inflation. Cash flows considered in the VIU model included the cash inflows and outflows related to the continuing use of the assets over their remaining useful lives, expected earnings, required maintenance capital expenditure, depreciation and working capital. The discount rate applied to cash flows in the VIU model was estimated using our weighted average cost of capital as determined by the Capital Asset Pricing Model with regard to the risks associated with the cash flows being considered (country, market and specific risks of the asset). The modelled cash flows take into account the established history of earnings of the Business, cash flow generation and the nature of the markets in which it operates, where product obsolescence is low.

The debt of the Business in these combined financial statements has fixed interest rates and, as such, the Business is not exposed to variable interest rate risk. The objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Business’ ability to continue as a going concern and provide returns to its owners. Financial risks are managed, on an on-going basis, by Ardagh’s central Group Treasury and senior management team. Ardagh does not permit the use of treasury instruments for speculative purposes, under any circumstances.

The Business operates in 20 countries, across four continents and its main currency exposure in the year to December 31, 2018, from the euro functional currency, was in relation to the U.S. dollar, British pound, Polish zloty and Danish krone. Currency exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognized assets and liabilities. As a result of the combined financial statements being presented in U.S dollar, the results of the Business are also impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the euro. The Business has a limited level of transactional currency exposure arising from sales or purchases by operating units in currencies other than their functional currencies. Fluctuations in the value of these currencies with respect to the euro currency may have a significant impact on the Business’ financial condition and results of operations. The Business believes that a strengthening of the euro exchange rate by 1% against all other foreign currencies from the December 31, 2018 rate would decrease invested capital by approximately $5 million (2017: $5 million, 2016: $5 million, 2015: $6 million).",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Aluminum ingot is traded daily as a commodity on the London Metal Exchange, which has historically been subject to significant price volatility. Because aluminum is priced in U.S. dollar, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/euro rate also affect the euro cost of aluminum ingot. The price and foreign currency risk on the aluminum purchases in the operations are hedged by entering into swaps under which we pay fixed euro prices. In contrast, the hedging market for steel, and in particular that for coking coal, is a relatively new market which does not have the depth of the aluminum market and as a consequence, there might be limitations to placing hedges in the market. The majority of the steel purchases of the Business are obtained under one-year contracts with prices that are usually fixed in advance. When such contracts are renewed in the future, our steel costs under such contracts will be subject to prevailing global steel and/or tinplate prices at the time of renewal, which may be different from historical prices. Furthermore, the relative price of oil and its by-products may materially impact our business, affecting our transport, lacquer and ink costs. The Business uses derivative agreements to manage some of the material cost risk. The Business depends on an active liquid market and available credit lines with counterparty banks to cover this risk. The use of derivative contracts to manage its risk is dependent on robust hedging procedures. Increasing raw material costs over time has the potential, if we are unable to pass on price increases, to reduce sales volume and could therefore have a significant impact on its financial condition. The Business is also exposed to possible interruptions of supply of aluminum and steel or other raw materials and any inability to purchase raw materials could negatively impact its operations. As a result of the volatility of gas and electricity prices, the Business has either included energy pass-through clauses in its sales contracts or developed an active hedging strategy to fix a significant proportion of its energy costs through contractual arrangements directly with our suppliers, where there is no energy clause in the sales contract.

Credit risk arises from derivative contracts, cash and deposits held with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to the customers of the Business, including outstanding receivables. The policy of the Business is to place excess liquidity on deposit with the central Ardagh Treasury entity who will, in turn, only place excess liquid funds with recognized and reputable financial institutions. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of ‘‘BBB+’’ from at least two credit rating agencies are accepted, where possible. The credit ratings of banks and financial institutions are monitored to ensure compliance with Ardagh Group policy. Risk of default is controlled within a policy framework of dealing with high quality institutions and by limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one bank or institution. Business policy is to extend credit to customers of good credit standing. Credit risk is managed on an on-going basis, by experienced people within the Business. The Business’ policy for the management of credit risk in relation to trade receivables involves periodically assessing the financial reliability of customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Provisions are made, where deemed necessary, and the utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. The Business does not expect any significant counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the ten largest customers of the Business accounted for approximately 35% of total revenues (2017: 39%; 2016: 40%).

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Business elected to re-design one of its pension schemes in Germany, moving from a defined benefit pension scheme to a contribution orientated system. This amendment resulted in the recognition of a past service credit of $12 million in the year within cost of sales. The past service credit was partly offset by a past service cost of $3 million following a high court judgement in the U.K. in October 2018 guaranteeing gender equality in U.K. pension schemes for accrued benefits (‘‘GMP Equalization’’). The GMP equalization past service cost has been recognized as exceptional within the combined income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017 a defined benefit pension scheme in the Netherlands was transferred to a multi-employer scheme. Prior to the date of transfer, a past service credit of $10 million was recognized such that, on the date of transfer, the defined benefit obligation and asset were both $602 million (December 31, 2016: $552 million and $541 million respectively). The Business has taken the exemption under IAS 19(R) to account for multi-employer schemes as defined contribution schemes. As a result, the scheme is no longer accounted for as a defined benefit scheme at December 31, 2017. F-70 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The U.K. plan has been closed to future accrual from July 1, 2014, with pensions calculated based on service to the point of closure, but with members’ benefits retaining a final salary link while employed by the Company. The pension plans in Germany operate under the framework of German Company Pension Law (BetrAVG) and general regulations based on German Labor Law. The entitlements of the plan members depend on years of service and final salary. Furthermore, the plans provide lifelong pensions.

The Condensed consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated for all periods presented. The interim consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‘‘U.S. GAAP’’) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures included are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. In management’s opinion, the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, the unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2019, the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Changes in Partners’ Equity for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, and the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, contained herein, reflect all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring items, which are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a basis consistent with that of the Company’s prior audited consolidated financial statements. However, the results of operations for the interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto and summary of significant accounting policies included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements the year ended December 31, 2018.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements",332.308.1,,"In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)—Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows and amends certain disclosure requirements of ASC 230. The guidance will generally be applied retrospectively and is effective for non-public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not result in any change to the classification or presentation in the statement of cash flows in any current or prior period. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ‘‘Reporting Comprehensive Income’’. This ASU gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. This ASU may be applied retrospectively to each period in the year of adoption. This ASU also requires new disclosures regarding our accounting policy for relating the tax effects in AOCI. The standard is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 did not have impact to the Company’s financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted,332.309.1,,"In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’’. In addition to superseding and replacing nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, ASC 606 establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model; changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time; provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics; and expands and improves disclosures about revenue. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the present guidance. In achieving the core principle, an entity should apply the five-step revenue recognition model as described in the standard. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date’’, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. As such, the Company will be required to apply the new revenue recognition standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction, which impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. In April 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-10, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property (IP). In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-12, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on collectability, non-cash F-86 -----",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted (Continued)",332.310.1,,"consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. These amendments are intended to address implementation issues and provide additional practical expedients. The Company has not early adopted the new revenue standard and will adopt the standard effective for the annual fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and for the interim periods in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact that the adoption of these revenue standards will have on the measurement, recognition and disclosure of revenue in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ‘‘Leases’’. The new standard applies a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments. Similar to the existing standard, the lessee will classify leases as either finance or operating. This classification will involve more judgement on the part of the lessee. The pattern of expense recognition in the income statement as well the effect on the statement of cash flows differs depending on the lease classification. Lessor accounting is similar to the current lease standard; however, updated to align with changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Similar to current leases standard, lessors will classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type. Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

Deferred taxes are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence.

The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the present guidance.

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (‘‘ASU 2016-09’’). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, though early adoption is permitted if all amendments are adopted in the same period. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-09. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in the Company making an accounting policy election to change how it will recognize the number of share-based payments that will ultimately vest. In the past, the Company applied a forfeiture rate to shares granted. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company will recognize forfeitures as they occur. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Scope of Modification Accounting (‘‘ASU 2017-09’’). ASU 2017-09 clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications. The guidance also clarifies that a modification to an award could be significant and therefore require disclosure, even if modification accounting is not required. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the provision of ASU 2017-09 on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date’’, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. As such, the Company will be required to apply the new revenue recognition standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction, which impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. In April 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-10, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property (IP). In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-12, ‘‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients’’ with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on collectability, non-cash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. These amendments are intended to address implementation issues and provide additional practical expedients. The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of these revenue standards will have on the measurement, recognition and disclosure of revenue in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ‘‘Leases’’. The new standard applies a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments. Similar to the existing standard, the lessee will classify leases as either finance or operating. This classification will involve more judgement on the part of the lessee. The pattern of expense recognition in the income statement as well the effect on the statement of cash flows differs depending on the lease classification. Lessor accounting is similar to the current lease standard; however, updated to align with changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Similar to current leases standard, lessors will classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type. Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, ‘‘Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments’’. This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow items with the objective of reducing diversity in practice and clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance will generally be applied F-103 ----- retrospectively and is effective for non-public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard. In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ‘‘Reporting Comprehensive Income’’. This ASU gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. This ASU may be applied retrospectively to each period in the year of adoption. This ASU will also require new disclosures regarding our accounting policy for relating the tax effects in AOCI. The standard is applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new standard.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

The Company’s 2017 consolidated financial statements included a one-time benefit to net income of approximately $8,500 to reflect the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate which was reduced from 35% to 21%. The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from the Company’s estimates, possibly materially, due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made by the Company as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. The Company’s reported income tax expense differs from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes (net of federal benefit), non-deductible operating expenses, the domestic production activity deduction and the impact of foreign operations with tax rates different than the statutory federal income tax rate.

These net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset a portion of future taxable income and, thereby, reduce or eliminate the foreign income taxes otherwise payable. At December 31, 2017, the Company maintained a valuation allowance totaling $4,772 against tax loss carryforwards at its Madryn, Argentina business. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company merged its Madryn, Argentina and Pilar, Argentina businesses, which allowed for the utilization of these tax loss carryforwards beginning in the 2018 tax year.

FASB ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy, prioritizing observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below: - Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2—Observable inputs that are based on prices not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data. - Level 3—Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The classification of fair value measurements within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

For non-public entities, the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. There was no impact to the Company from the adoption of this update. In 2016, FASB issued amendments to ASC No. 835 as issued in the ASU 2015-03 and further clarified through the release of ASU 2015-15. The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. Under ASU 2015-15, it is clarified that due to a lack of authoritative guidance with respect to the presentation of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements, such costs continue to be deferred and presented as an asset and amortized over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement. This adoption did not have any impact on the current year consolidated financial statements. On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation. The targeted amendments intend to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The amendment also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 elevates the statutory tax withholding threshold after settlement of a share-based award to qualify for equity classification up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction. The cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. ASU 2016-09 provides an optional accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, consistent with the existing standard, or account for forfeitures when they occur. The new standard did not impact the measurement and recognition of stock-based compensation and related tax impact in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this update provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting in Topic 718. The amendments provide guidance on modifications in circumstances where the entity has determined the change to not be substantive. F-126 ----- An entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all the following are met: - The fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if such an alternative measurement method is used) of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. If the modifications do not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award, the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification. - The vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. - The classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. Adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In 2017, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the accounting for measurement period adjustments. The amendments in this update require that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this update require that the acquirer record, in the same period’s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Adoption of the ASU did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09, which creates a new topic in the ASC: 606 Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606). In addition to superseding and replacing nearly all existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance, ASC 606 establishes a new control-based revenue recognition model; changes the basis for deciding when revenue is recognized over time or at a point in time; provides new and more detailed guidance on specific topics; and expands and improves disclosures about revenue. The standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the present guidance. In achieving the core principle, an entity should apply the five-step revenue recognition model as described in the standard. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. As such, the Company will be required to apply the new revenue recognition standard for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on assessing whether an entity is a principal or an agent in a revenue transaction, which impacts whether an entity reports revenue on a gross or net basis. In April 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property (IP). In May 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients with amendments to ASU 2014-09 on collectability, non-cash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. These amendments are intended to address implementation issues and provide additional practical expedients. The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of these revenue standards will have on the measurement, recognition and disclosure of revenue in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued the new leases standard (Topic 842) which supersedes the existing standard Topic 840, Leases. The lessees will likely see the most significant change. The new standard applies a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments. Similar to the existing standard, the lessee will classify leases as either finance or operating. This classification will involve more judgement on the part of the lessee. The pattern of expense recognition in the income statement as well the effect on the statement of cash flows differs depending on the lease classification. Lessor accounting is similar to the current leases standard, but updated to align with changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. Similar to current leases standard, lessors will classify leases as operating, direct financing, or sales-type. F-128 ----- Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard is effective for non-public entities for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. The Company currently anticipates adopting the standard as of January 1, 2020. The Company is evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on the measurement, recognition and disclosure of leases in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2019,571

If such events or circumstances are present, a loss is recognized to the extent the carrying values of the asset are in excess of estimated fair value. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated financial statements and reported at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated and amortized. The assets and assets of a disposal group classified as held-for-sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated financial statements.
