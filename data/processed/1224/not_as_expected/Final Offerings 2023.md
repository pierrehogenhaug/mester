OFFERING MEMORANDUM

#### INEOS Finance plc

€400,000,000 6 ⅝% Senior Secured Notes due 2028
$425,000,000 6 ¾% Senior Secured Notes due 2028

**Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by**

INEOS Group Holdings S.A., INEOS Luxembourg I S.A., INEOS Holdings Limited

**and certain of their subsidiaries**

INEOS Finance plc (the “Issuer”) is offering (the “Offering”) €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its

euro-denominated 6 ⅝% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Euro Notes”) and $425,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of its dollar-denominated 6 ¾% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Dollar Notes” and, together with the Euro
Notes, the “Notes”). Interest on the Notes will accrue from February 16, 2023 and be payable semi-annually in arrear on
May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning November 15, 2023.

The Notes will mature on May 15, 2028. Some or all of the Notes may be redeemed prior to February 15, 2025,

by paying 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus a “make-whole” premium, and at any time on or after
February 15, 2025, at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum. In addition, at any time on or prior to
February 15, 2025, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each of the Euro Notes and the
Dollar Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at 106.625% of the principal amount of the Euro Notes or
at 106.750% of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes, as applicable, plus accrued interest, if at least 50% of the Euro
Notes or Dollar Notes, as applicable, remain outstanding.

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” each holder of the Notes may require

the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes. All of the Notes may also be redeemed at 100% of their principal
amount plus accrued interest if at any time the Issuer or any Guarantor (as defined below) becomes obligated to pay
withholding taxes as a result of certain changes in law.

The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations and will, upon issuance, (i) rank pari passu in right of

payment with all of the Issuer’s existing and future indebtedness that is not subordinated to the Notes; and (ii) be
guaranteed by INEOS Group Holdings S.A. (the “Parent”), INEOS Luxembourg I S.A. (“Lux I”), INEOS Holdings
Limited and certain of their subsidiaries on a senior secured basis (together, the “Guarantors”). Upon issuance, or within
30 days (or in the case of certain deposit accounts and security account control agreements and in the case of real
property collateral, 60 and 90 days, respectively) after issuance, the Notes and the guarantees will be secured by first
ranking liens (subject to certain exceptions) on the same assets that secure the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Term Loans as more fully described in “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees” and elsewhere
in this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum includes more detailed information on the terms of the Notes, the guarantees and the

security interests as briefly described above, including redemption and repurchase prices, security, covenants and transfer
restrictions and, therefore, this offering memorandum should be read as a whole by any prospective purchaser in making
a determination as to whether to invest in the Notes.

Currently there is no public market for the Notes. This document constitutes the listing particulars (“Listing

**Particulars”) in respect of the admission of the Notes to the Official List and to trading on the Euro MTF market of the**
Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the “Euro MTF Market”). Application was made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
for the approval of this document as Listing Particulars. Application has been made to list the Notes on the Official List
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and for trading on the Euro MTF Market. The Euro MTF Market is not a regulated


-----

market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU. This offering memorandum constitutes a prospectus for
purposes of Part IV of the Luxembourg law on prospectuses for securities dated July 16, 2019.

Investing in the Notes involves risks that are described in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 24 of this

offering memorandum.

Offering price for the Euro Notes: 100.000% plus accrued interest from the issue date, if any.

Offering price for the Dollar Notes: 100.000% plus accrued interest from the issue date, if any.

qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons (within the meaning of
Regulation S under the Securities Act) outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act.

This offering memorandum is based on information provided by us and by other sources that we believe are

of this offering memorandum or for any statement made or purported to be made therein. The Initial Purchasers
accordingly disclaim all and any liability, whether arising in tort or contract or otherwise which they might otherwise

offering memorandum or any other document executed in connection with this Offering. The Initial Purchasers are only

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND NON-IFRS INFORMATION**

**Financial Information**

The consolidated financial information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. included elsewhere in this offering

memorandum as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019
have been extracted from the audited consolidated financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2021 (“2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”), from the audited consolidated
financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 (“2020 Audited
**Consolidated Financial Statements”) and from the audited consolidated financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings**
S.A. as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 (“2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”). The 2021
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, together with the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the
2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, are referred to as the “Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.”
The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte Audit, Société à responsabilité limitée.
We believe that non-disclosure of the Issuer’s accounts would not be likely to mislead investors with regard to facts and
circumstances that are essential for assessing the Notes.

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (as defined

herein). As of January 1, 2019, the Group, complying with IFRS requirements, adopted IFRS 16 Leases. IFRS 16 Leases
introduced a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments.
There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items. Previously, the Group recognized
operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognized assets and liabilities only to the
extent that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognized. The Group adopted
IFRS 16 Leases on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach and measuring the right-of-use asset equal
to the lease liability. Please see note 1 “Accounting Policies—Changes in accounting policies—IFRS 16 Leases” to the
2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more information
on the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases.

Unless stated otherwise, the consolidated financial information of the Group as of December 31, 2019 is

extracted from the restated comparative information in the 2020 Audited Financial Statements included in this offering
memorandum. The deferred tax assets balance as of December 31, 2019 was restated for a revision in the Parent’s
calculation of deferred tax assets in relation to unfunded defined benefit pension plan liabilities in Germany to comply
with the requirements of IAS 12. The restatement has led to a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in other
reserves deficit of €71.6 million as of December 31, 2019 showing as comparative information in the 2020 Audited
Financial Statements.

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. included

elsewhere in this offering memorandum as of September 30, 2022 and for the three- and nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 including unaudited comparative interim financial information for the three- and nine-month period
ended September 30, 2021 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the standard of IFRS applicable to interim
financial statements (as defined herein) (the “Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” and,
together with the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). For a
complete description of the accounting principles applied in preparing INEOS Group Holdings S.A.’s audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, please see,
respectively, note 1 “Accounting Policies” to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 2 “Principal
Accounting Policies” to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 is based on the

Consolidated Financial Statements and has been prepared by subtracting the unaudited financial information of INEOS
Group Holdings S.A. for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 extracted from the Unaudited Interim
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the corresponding financial information of INEOS Group
Holdings S.A. for the year ended December 31, 2021 extracted from the 2021 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
and then adding the corresponding unaudited financial information of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022 extracted from the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 has not been prepared in

accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation, the UK
Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. Such financial data has not been audited or
reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing or review standards. INEOS Group Holdings S.A.’s
unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022 has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future period and is not prepared in the

ix


-----

ordinary course of our financial reporting. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September
30, 2022 are non-IFRS financial measures.

This offering memorandum also includes certain unaudited consolidated financial information that has been

adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions as if they had taken place, with
respect to unaudited pro forma net debt, on September 30, 2022, and, with respect to unaudited pro forma cash interest
expense, on October 1, 2021. The unaudited consolidated pro forma financial information has been prepared for
illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated financial position would have
been if the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions had occurred on September 30, 2022, with respect to the unaudited
_pro forma net debt, or October 1, 2021 with respect to unaudited pro forma cash interest expense, nor does it purport to_
project our consolidated financial position or performance at any future date. The unaudited pro forma financial
information set forth in this offering memorandum is based on available information and certain assumptions and
estimates that we believe are reasonable but may differ from the actual amounts.

**Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

We have presented certain information in this offering memorandum based on non-IFRS measures, including

net cash interest expense, total indebtedness and net debt as well as EBITDA-based measures. We define the following
non-IFRS financial measures as follows:

      - **Net cash interest expense comprises interest payable on senior notes (i.e., the senior notes issued by IGH,**
which were redeemed in full on November 9, 2021, and the senior secured notes issued by the Issuer),
interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts and interest payable on securitization, less interest income on
bank balances, as follows:


**For the** **For the**

**nine-month** **twelve-month**

**For the year ended** **period ended** **period ended**

**December 31,** **September 30,** **September 30,**

**2021** **2020** **2019** **2022** **2021** **2022**

Interest payable on senior notes ......................................... 94.7 95.5 97.1 33.6 77.4 50.9

Interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts .................... 113.8 107.3 123.5 126.4 81.8 158.4

Interest payable on securitization ....................................... 5.8 7.9 10.3 3.7 4.5 5.0

_less interest income on bank balances ................................_ 1.0 2.5 11.8 10.0 0.5 10.5

**Net cash interest expense .................................................** **213.3** **208.2** **219.1** **153.7** **163.2** **203.8**

      - **Total indebtedness represents gross long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings plus gross short-term**
interest-bearing loans and borrowings before deduction of unamortized debt issuance costs. Under IFRS,
debt issuance costs are deducted from the related debt amounts for the purposes of balance sheet
presentation and are amortized over the life of the debt. Total indebtedness excludes lease obligations,
which are included in a separate line item on the balance sheet.

      - **Net debt represents total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents.**

A reconciliation of total financial indebtedness to net debt as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and

September 30, 2022 is presented in the table below:

**Net debt ....................................................................................................** **5,679.1** **6,288.4** **5,904.4** **5,347.0**

EBITDA before exceptionals is the EBITDA-based financial measure that is utilized in this offering

memorandum:

x


-----

      - **EBITDA before exceptionals represents profit for the period before net finance costs or income, tax**
charges or credits, depreciation, amortization and impairment, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint
ventures using the equity accounting method, profit on disposal of investments, profit on disposal of fixed
assets, and exceptional items as defined in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with IFRS,
we use both the first in first out (“FIFO”) and weighted average cost methods of accounting for purposes of
determining our inventory cost in connection with the preparation of our audited annual consolidated
financial statements. EBITDA before exceptionals is based on the FIFO and weighted average cost methods
of accounting for inventory used in connection with the preparation of such financial statements. EBITDA
before exceptionals is derived from income statement line items calculated in accordance with IFRS on a
historical cost basis.

The reconciliation of INEOS’ EBITDA before exceptionals to profit for the period is as follows:

(a) Please see note 10 to “Property, Plant and Equipment” and note 4 to “Exceptional Items” in each of the 2020 and 2019 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more information on impairment charges, including
exceptional impairment charges.

(b) In 2021, the amount represents gains related to the final true-up of the original closure cost provision made in December 2019 in respect of
the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United Kingdom following lower than expected demolition costs. In 2020, the amount represents a
provision for early retirement costs as part of a restructuring within the Köln site within the O&P Europe business in the second half of
2020. In 2019, the amount represents exceptional restructuring costs due to the closure of the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom, including severance and outplacement expenses, together with decommissioning and demolition costs, as well as exceptional
costs due to the settlement of an intellectual property dispute in respect of the former Technologies business. Please see note 4 to
“Exceptional Items” in each of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more
information on exceptional items.

(c) Please see note 8 to “Finance Income and Costs” and note 4 to “Exceptional Items” in each of the 2021 and 2019 Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for more information on finance costs, including exceptional finance
costs.

These EBITDA-based measures are non-IFRS measures. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA-based

measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. However, EBITDA-based measures should
not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for operating profit, profit, cash flows from operating activities or
other measures of performance as defined by IFRS. These EBITDA-based measures, as used herein, are not necessarily
comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of
calculation. Our management has used, and expects to use, EBITDA-based measures to assess operating performance
and to make decisions about allocating resources among our various segments. In assessing our overall performance and
the performance of each of our segments, management reviews EBITDA-based measures as a general indicator of
performance compared to prior periods. Furthermore, management and employee bonuses can be linked to the
EBITDA-based performance of the business and the region in which they work. Our EBITDA-based measures exclude
items that management does not consider in assessing operating performance. Our management believes it is useful to
eliminate such items because it allows management to focus on what it considers to be a more meaningful indicator of
operating performance and ability to generate cash flow from operations.

EBITDA before exceptionals differs from Consolidated EBITDA, as presented in the “Description of the

Notes,” which is on a pre-IFRS 16-basis and includes certain cost savings as defined in the definition therein.

The information presented by the EBITDA-based measures is unaudited and has not been prepared in

accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of this measure is not intended to
and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to
make changes to the presentation of this information.

**Overview**

We are one of the world’s largest chemical companies as measured by revenue. Our business has highly

integrated world class chemical facilities and production technologies. We have leading global market positions for a
majority of our key products and a strong and stable customer base. We currently operate 33 manufacturing sites in six
countries throughout the world. We are led by a highly experienced management team with, on a combined basis, over
100 years of experience in the chemical industry. As of September 30, 2022, our total chemical production capacity was
approximately 23,000 kta, of which 55% was in Europe and 45% was in North America.

We operate our business through three segments: Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers North

America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and natural gas, and
include olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived from olefins. Our products
serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including packaging, construction, automotive, white goods/durables,
agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Our highly integrated, world class production facilities and technological know-how allow us to process raw

materials into higher value-added products. In Europe, we own two sites integrated with crackers and polymer units.
Typically, these two sites account for approximately 76% of our European olefin and polymer volumes. The polyolefins
plants on our two major sites in Europe normally receive more than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated
crackers. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for our polymer business is supplied
by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas or by integrated third-party facilities, such as the Tesoro facility in
Carson, California. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are able to capture attractive margins across
the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply, reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and
optimize our product slate.

We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large scale, well invested, highly integrated facilities

strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1, 2007, we and our
predecessors have invested approximately €10.7 billion (including investments in divested assets) in our production
facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, and state of the art production units. This includes
significant investments of almost €3.5 billion in the last five years to further enhance our assets’ capabilities. We believe
these investments allow us to operate at lower cost and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enable
us to maintain positive margin and cash flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the
twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022, our revenue was €21.8 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was
€3.3 billion.

Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower our operating

costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed asset investments to expand
our capacity in higher value products, to enhance productivity at our existing facilities, and to reduce our fixed cost
structure through headcount reductions, production line closures and system upgrades. In addition, we have shifted our
product portfolio to focus on more differentiated products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium
pricing strategies designed to improve our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to
drive growth, create significant operating leverage and position us to benefit from volume recovery in our end markets.

Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets from

Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets from
major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and Innovene in December 2005
represented a transformational milestone for our company, providing global scale and further upstream integration.

In 2011, we transferred our Refining Business, our Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business and certain

infrastructure assets to three joint ventures outside the INEOS Group. Please see “Business—Refining Divestiture,
Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Refining Divestiture” for a further description of the disposal of
our Refining Business and Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business.


-----

In 2013, we completed the Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our

indirect parent company. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Grangemouth Divestiture.”

In 2014, we divested the olefins and polymers assets and Chemical Intermediates assets of the Lavéra site. See

“Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Lavéra Divestiture.”

In 2015, we completed the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker at Rafnes,

Norway from the INOVYN group (formerly the Kerling Group), a related party. In 2015, we also acquired aromatics and
cumene assets from Axiall Corporation. The acquisition comprised the world’s largest cumene plant in Pasadena, Texas.
In addition, Axiall’s phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene business was transferred to the INEOS phenol facility at
Mobile, Alabama.

In 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one of the largest high density

polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America. Moreover, in 2016, following a strategic review of the
INEOS Technologies business, we decided to cease marketing its polyolefins licensing technology externally and to
transfer the remaining parts of the INEOS Technologies business to existing businesses within the Group to provide a
clearer focus on individual product lines.

In 2019, the Group acquired the INESCO combined heat and power plant at the Antwerp site in Belgium.

In December 2020, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE joint venture from

Sasol Chemicals. The principal activity of the company is the production of high density polyethylene in La Porte, Texas,
United States. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100% through Unrestricted Subsidiaires (as
defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement). Prior to the acquisition the Group reflected its
50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture. A Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement) of the Group is the operator of the facility and has the exclusive right to supply Gemini with the
required components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the HDPE products and to take such quantity
of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE
Term Loans.”

In December 2021, the Group acquired the assets of Charter Plastics in Titusville, United States, a manufacturer

of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe products.

In the summer of 2022, the Group began construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp, Belgium, for

the production of ethylene with a nameplate capacity of approximately 1,450 kta, along with associated utilities, tankage
and infrastructure (“Project ONE”). We believe Project ONE is the largest investment in the European chemicals
industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most environmentally-friendly of its kind. It is planned to
be equipped with the best available technologies with a high efficiency in use of raw materials and energy, CO2
emissions that are expected to be less than half of the currently best performing similar units in Europe from the outset
and a clear path to carbon neutrality on a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis within 10 years of start-up of the cracker. See also
“Risk Factors—Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or developments may prove difficult for
us to consummate,” “Risk Factors—Litigation—We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us,
and adverse results may harm our business” and “Business—Facilities—Project ONE.”

In August 2022, the Group agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui

Chemicals for approximately $330.0 million, which will add more than 1,000 kta of capacity, including for cumene,
phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A, upon completion (expected in the first quarter of 2023).

In December 2022, the Group acquired for approximately RMB 10.5 billion, through an Unrestricted

Subsidiary, a 50% interest in the Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited facility in Shanghai, China
(“SECCO”). The remaining 50% is owned by SINOPEC. SECCO has a capacity of 4,200 kta of petrochemicals,
including ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, polystyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, benzene and
toluene. The Group also agreed to acquire, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary, a 50% interest in a new petrochemical
complex being built in China, which is currently under construction by SINOPEC and is expected to be on-stream by the
end of 2023 (the “Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project”). This complex also includes a new 500 kta HDPE (HighDensity Polyethylene) plant.

_Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins & Polymers North America_

In our olefins and polymers businesses, we produce olefins, other cracker products, such as butadiene and

benzene, and a broad range of polyolefin polymers. We are among the largest producers of olefins and polymers in the
world. The focus of our olefins business in Europe and North America is on ethylene and propylene, which are the two
largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. The olefins we make are primarily used as
feedstock for our derivatives businesses. In addition, we sell olefins to third-party customers for a variety of industrial
and consumer applications, including the manufacture of plastics, rubber and fiber. In our polymers business, we focus
on polyethylene and polypropylene.

We operate a total of 19 sites for olefins and polyolefins, including our large integrated olefins cracker and

polyolefin facilities at Köln, Germany, Rafnes, Norway, and Chocolate Bayou, Texas, United States and nine
polyethylene pipe manufacturing sites within the United States. These facilities support our highly competitive
proprietary polyolefin process technologies. The technologies include our cost-effective gas phase polypropylene
technology, our specialized technology for high-density polyethylene and our flexible proprietary “swing” technology for
both linear low-density and high-density polyethylene.

The North American and European markets for olefins and polyolefins are quite distinct, with separate pricing

structures and distribution channels. As a result, each market may experience different rates of growth and levels of
return. Therefore, we operate these two businesses separately and report them as two distinct segments—INEOS
Olefins & Polymers Europe and INEOS Olefins & Polymers North America. For the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2022, our Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins & Polymers North America businesses contributed
€9.5 billion and €6.0 billion of revenue (excluding intersegmental eliminations) and €775.4 million and €1,372.4 million
of EBITDA before exceptionals, respectively (including, in each case, intersegmental eliminations).

_Chemical Intermediates_

Chemical intermediates are higher-value-added chemical products used as key components in a wide variety of

consumer and industrial products. In our Chemical Intermediates business, we utilize olefins as key raw materials and
produce a wide range of products, including phenol, acetone, alpha olefins, ethylene oxide and derivatives, acrylonitrile,
ammonia and nitriles.

We have four main product groups within our Chemical Intermediates business: INEOS Nitriles, INEOS

Oligomers, INEOS Oxide and INEOS Phenol. We have a total of 16 manufacturing sites globally, with many of our
plants integrated either directly with their key raw materials on-site, or integrated via pipeline connection. In August
2022, we agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals, which will add
more than 1,000 kta of capacity, including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A, upon
completion (expected in the first quarter of 2023).

We are the world’s leading producer of phenol, which is an essential starting material for a wide range of

applications in the electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture industries. Our main product
in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibers and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
plastic. We are also among the largest volume suppliers of linear and poly alpha olefins in the world. According to
NexantECA, we are the second largest producer of ethylene oxide in Western Europe. We have a range of associated
products, including ethylene glycol, propylene oxide, propylene glycol and acetate esters. We manufacture and supply
high-quality catalysts and additives in support of various technologies to major companies around the world, and also to
our own manufacturing assets. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022, our Chemical Intermediates
revenue and EBITDA before exceptionals were €10.2 billion and €1,114.8 million, respectively, excluding
intersegmental eliminations.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the factors set forth below provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets in which we

compete:

      - **_Diversified Portfolio of Businesses with Leading Market Positions._** We are one of the world’s largest
chemical companies. We operate 33 manufacturing sites in six countries around the world. These assets
have a total production capacity of approximately 23,000 kta as of September 30, 2022. We believe we
have a top 5 or better global or regional market position in 12 of our key products.

Our petrochemical products are utilized in a wide range of end-market applications. The following diagram sets

forth our petrochemicals revenue by end use application in 2021.


-----

**Petrochemicals Revenue by Application 2021**

Our petrochemical products are sold to customers in diverse geographic locations. The following diagram sets
forth the group third party revenue by region in 2021.

**Group Third Party Revenue by Region 2021**

We believe that such application and market diversity reduces the effect of industry cyclicality on our results. In

addition, we believe that we benefit from the fact that the supply and demand dynamics of the cycles relating to our
petrochemical products are fairly independent, which helps mitigate some of the cyclicality in the industry.

      - **_Vertically Integrated, World-Scale Producer._** We have three large-scale petrochemical sites, accounting
for approximately 41% of our total petrochemical production capacity as of September 30, 2022. Each of
these sites is integrated with a major cracker and/or polymers and derivatives unit.

We operate one of the largest single-site ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plants in Europe and the two largest

phenol plants in Europe, one of which is the largest in the world, as well as the largest single train phenol plant in North
America. We operate the largest acrylonitrile facility in the world and one of the largest high-density polyethylene
complexes in North America. We believe that our existing plants have sufficient capacity such that as our production
volumes increase, we will be able to leverage our fixed cost base and increase our profitability.

Our sites are typically located near raw materials, refineries and associated pipeline infrastructure. We believe

our highly integrated facilities provide us with the ability to capture margins across the value chain, enjoy certainty of


-----

feedstock supply (particularly for ethylene), reduce logistical costs, improve energy management, adjust the product slate
to capture greater value (by selling olefins or, alternatively, by using them internally in the production of polymers or
derivatives) and reduce our exposure to margin volatility as a result of changes in raw material prices. We operate large
plants that permit us to spread fixed costs over large volumes of production, thereby reducing unit costs and enhancing
profits.

      - **_Well-Invested, Highly Efficient Production Facilities._** Our large, well-invested plants benefit from
economies of scale and favorable locations. Our acquisition activity has focused on acquiring businesses
that complement our existing manufacturing facilities with well-invested physical assets from major
chemical companies. In addition, each year we continue to invest in improving and expanding our facilities.
Since January 1, 2007, we and our predecessors have invested approximately €10.7 billion (including
investments in divested assets) in our production facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting
in integrated, and state-of-the-art production units. This includes significant investments of almost
€3.5 billion in the last five years to further enhance our assets’ capabilities.

      - **_Extensive Portfolio of Leading Proprietary Technologies._** We have a broad portfolio of proprietary
manufacturing technologies which we use for the manufacturing of our key products. We believe that they
enable us to be one of the lowest cost producers and provide us with a significant competitive advantage in
terms of product quality, and we continue to improve the portfolio through focused research and technology
investments.

      - **_Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record._** Our senior management team has been
operating INEOS and our predecessors for over 20 years and has a demonstrated track record of achieving
profitable growth in the chemical industry, successfully integrating large acquisitions, dramatically
reducing the fixed cost base, and deleveraging the business following such acquisitions. James A. Ratcliffe,
our controlling shareholder, and the other existing shareholders have a successful record of investing in the
chemical industry. Across the wider INEOS group, including our ultimate parent company and its other
subsidiaries, we have completed 38 significant acquisitions since the formation of INEOS in 1998. Each of
these acquisitions has been integrated effectively and we have been able to achieve significant cost-savings
in the acquired businesses. Our management team has extensive experience in the chemical industry,
including working for leading companies such as ICI, DuPont, Dow, Degussa and BP, and a proven ability
to increase productivity, reduce costs and control capital expenditures and working capital. We believe the
experience of our management team is a distinct competitive advantage.

In addition, our senior management team has demonstrated the ability to streamline our businesses by
focusing on core competencies and disposing of non-core or underperforming businesses. In the past 12
years, we have disposed of three non-core or underperforming businesses. We disposed of the Refining
Business and the Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business in July 2011. On October 1, 2013, we completed the
Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our indirect parent
company. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Grangemouth Divestiture.” On July 1, 2014, the Group completed the Lavéra Divestiture to a new
subsidiary of INEOS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Group at the time of the divestiture. See
“Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Lavéra
Divestiture.” The disposal of these three businesses has enabled us to focus management time on core
activities, reduce our capital expenditure requirements going forward and also reduce our exposure to
underperforming cash consuming businesses.

      - **_Access to Advantaged Feedstocks._** Our Chocolate Bayou cracker installation in the United States uses
natural gas liquids-based feedstocks, such as ethane, as its main feedstocks. This allows us to benefit from
the current low-cost supply of ethane resulting from the growth in the supply of shale gas in the United
States. Ethane is also a lower-cost feedstock than naphtha in Europe, where we operate a very efficient gas
olefin cracker in Rafnes. In 2019, our butane storage tank contract was signed to provide the largest ever
built in Europe. The tank came on stream in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium in October 2020. Our other
olefin cracker in Europe, at Köln, is a naphtha cracker, but it has significant gas cracking flexibility. Our
ability to use lower-cost feedstocks, like ethane and butane, gives us an advantage over our competitors
with crackers that cannot accept such a significant mix of gas feedstocks, and must rely on more expensive
naphtha. The gas cracking flexibility has been enhanced further with expanded butane supply to our cracker
in Köln supported by four Rhine river barges. Contracts for supply of four Rhine river barges were signed
in 2018 with delivery of three in 2020 and the fourth delivery in 2021. In the summer of 2022, we began
construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp, Belgium for the production of ethylene. We believe
it is the largest investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be
among the most environmentally-friendly of its kind.


-----

In addition, our Chocolate Bayou cracker and our naphtha crackers in Europe can also use naphtha as a
feedstock, allowing us to manage our feedstock mix in response to changes in economic and market
conditions and maximize our margins. Our fleet of eight long-term chartered Dragon class ships and four
VLEC vessels, together with the expanded gas storage terminal in Rafnes, a deep water terminal near
Philadelphia and long-term supply contracts, provides us access to the attractive U.S. ethane market for our
gas-based cracker in Rafnes, Norway.

**Our Business Strategy**

In response to challenges resulting from the current macroeconomic environment and as part of our long-term

strategic aim, we have maintained and will continue to execute a strategy consisting of the following short- and long-term
elements. These are designed to help us improve our capital structure, leverage our key strengths and market
opportunities and ensure ongoing cash flow generation and growth:

      - **_Where and When Appropriate, and within the Confines of Our Capital Structure, to Pursue Long-term_**
**_Value-added Growth Opportunities. As a result of our lean corporate structure, we are able to maintain a_**
level of agility that few organizations our size are able to match. We have a highly disciplined evaluation
process and a detailed series of metrics by which we measure the value creation prospects of potential
projects. Opportunities for profitable growth are identified and vetted in an efficient, non-bureaucratic
format, which, in many cases, we believe enables us to establish a first-mover advantage. For example, we
continued to pursue opportunities to grow our assets in the U.S. through the expansion of our Chocolate
Bayou cracker in 2020, and, also in 2020, acquired the remaining 50% of the high-density polyethylene
plant at our Battleground site in Texas from Sasol Limited. Our O&P Europe business also has in place 15year supply and infrastructure agreements entered into in 2012 to access ethane feedstock from the United
States for use in its European cracker complexes. In 2020, we opened a new 420 kta linear alpha olefins
plant and, in 2022, we opened a new 120 kta poly alpha olefins plant, both at Chocolate Bayou, Texas. In
the summer of 2022, we began construction of our 1,450 kta ethane steam cracker for the production of
ethylene in Antwerp, Belgium. In addition, we are currently pursuing several other projects that we believe
provide opportunities for profitable growth. We are particularly focused on expanding our footprint in Asia
to further access the high demand growth of that region, which may take the form of joint ventures and
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. For example, in 2022, we acquired a 50% interest in the SECCO facility in China
and agreed to acquire a 50% stake in the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project, which is currently under
construction by SINOPEC, is expected to be on-stream by the end of 2023 and includes a new 500 kta
HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plant, in each case through an Unrestricted Subsidiary. In 2022, we
also agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals, which
will add more than 1,000 kta of capacity, including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and
bisphenol A, upon completion (expected in the first quarter of 2023).

      - **_Continue to Drive Sustainability as a Fundamental Part of Our Business._** We believe we are a leader in
driving sustainable practices across our industry as evidenced by our recent Sustainalytics rating which
placed us as 11th best (11th lowest risk) of 483 chemical companies so far assessed, and 3rd best out of 234
commodity chemical companies. Our sustainability strategy is to develop and safely manufacture the
products needed to address the evolving challenges of climate change, public health, resource scarcity,
urbanization and waste in a way which drives us all towards a net-zero emission economy by 2050 whilst
being profitable. We believe our Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (“HSSE”) performance is
industry leading. Our strategy is to continue to improve injury and environmental compliance ratings by
applying increasingly sophisticated methodologies, with the ultimate aim being to achieve zero accidents.
We seek to ensure that all employees receive appropriate training, thereby enabling them to effectively
contribute to HSSE performance and HSSE improvement processes. It is our policy to design our processes
and manufacture and distribute our products in a responsible manner so that our employees, customers, the
public and the environment are protected from all avoidable risks. Our businesses have put in place
roadmaps to lead the transition to a Net Zero Economy in our industry by no later than 2050, whilst
remaining profitable, and staying ahead of evolving regulations and legislation. Based on these roadmaps,
we are setting ambitious but achievable targets for 2030 which are in line with our 2050 commitment. For
example, as compared to 2019, our target is to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 33% on a
like-for-like basis by no later than 2030. This target is consistent with EU and other national targets. In the
near term, we are investing over €6 billion on projects which will reduce our emissions footprint. We are
also investing in new products and technologies to drive the industry to a circular economy in which
materials are re-used to the maximum extent, and no products, once used, enter the natural environment.
For example, we have committed to make all our products recyclable and, by 2025, to develop a range of
polyolefin products containing at least 50% recycled product. Overall, across wider INEOS (including
entities outside of the Group), we have committed to achieving 850kt of recycled or bio content in our
polymers by 2030, which, again is consistent with likely regulatory targets in Europe.


-----

- **_Generate Cost Savings and Enhance Efficiency._** We have historically succeeded in reducing costs at our
acquired businesses by making rapid reductions in underlying fixed costs and implementing an efficient
corporate and management structure. We have achieved significant fixed cost reductions in businesses that
we have acquired, delivering on average a reduction of 22% of inherited fixed costs in the four-year period
post acquisition. Continuous improvements in the efficiency of our existing sites and opportunities for site
consolidation are key aspects of this strategy, as we seek to maintain upper quartile cost positions and
world-scale facilities across the majority of our operations. The control of fixed costs will continue to be a
key priority for our business.

- **_Generate Strong Cash Flow._** We intend to continue our focus on cash flow generation by maximizing the
utilization of assets, leveraging existing resources, continuously improving working capital practices,
following disciplined and focused capital expenditure and cost reduction plans and optimizing where
possible our capital structure. This focus has allowed us to reduce our costs and improve our cash flow
management, such as the ability to implement lower levels of maintenance capital expenditure. We apply
the cash flows generated from these initiatives to help reduce our debt and to strategically invest in the
business.

- **_Maximize Utilization of Assets._** As a low-cost focused producer, we believe in operating our facilities at
full capacity. We believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows, even during downturns
in industry cycles or customer demand, more readily than some of our competitors who have higher
production costs. We intend to achieve growth in production volume by improving utilization rates within
the defined availability of an asset, improving availability of an asset by minimizing planned and unplanned
facility downtime and improving capacity of an asset through de-bottlenecking projects. We have a strong
track record of improving utilization rates of acquired assets.

- **_Maintain a Lean Corporate Structure and Incentivize Employees._** We intend to operate our business in a
manner that is consistent with the philosophy of our shareholders and maintain a simple and decentralized,
flat organizational structure that minimizes corporate bureaucracy, coupled with compensation
arrangements that incentivize our employees. We believe that a simple and decentralized organizational
structure is cost-effective and will allow each of our management teams the freedom to use their industry
knowledge to respond to market opportunities. We believe that we can increase the value of our business
when our employees share in the value they create. We have management and employee bonuses and
long-term incentive plans linked to the EBITDA before exceptionals performance and other factors of the
business in which they work.

- **_Maximize Flexibility to Use Advantaged Feedstocks._** We remain focused on our strategy of acquiring
advantaged feedstock sources and improving our flexibility to use different feedstocks to take advantage of
changing market conditions. In 2017, we entered into an agreement to construct one of the largest butane
tanks in Europe. In 2019, our butane storage tank contract was signed to provide the largest ever built in
Europe. The tank came on stream in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium in October 2020 and allows us to import
butane from the United States (and from all over the world) to supply material to our naphtha crackers at
Köln. This project complements our contracts signed in 2012 and 2015 to source ethane directly from the
United States for our Rafnes cracker as well as our a new ethane import tank and new ethane furnace at our
Norwegian plant. The gas cracking flexibility has been enhanced further with expanded butane supply to
our cracker in Köln supported by four Rhine river barges, which were delivered in 2020 and 2021. We are
also committed to maintaining flexibility in feedstock while expanding our olefins capacity. For example,
our Chocolate Bayou plant predominantly uses liquid based natural gas as feedstock, but has the ability to
process naphtha and our Köln plant is capable of switching between naphtha and butane as a feedstock.
This enables us to manage our feedstock mix in line with changing market and economic conditions. To
further enhance our sourcing of advantaged feedstock, we began construction of a new ethane steam cracker
in Antwerp, Belgium, referred to as Project ONE, for the production of ethylene in the summer of 2022. We
believe it is the largest investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it
to be among the most environmentally-friendly of its kind.

each case, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by, the guarantor maintenance covenant in the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date after giving effect to the exclusion of the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior
Secured Term Loans Agreement) and consolidated total assets of certain subsidiaries of the Parent (including Unrestricted Subsidiaries),
which represent approximately 1.1% of the Parent’s consolidated EBITDA before exceptionals for the same period and hold approximately
6.9% of the Parent’s consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2022). Each Guarantor also guarantees the Senior Secured Term Loans
and the Existing Senior Secured Notes on a pari passu basis. The obligations of each Guarantor will be subject to various limitations and

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**Trading Statement**

Based on management’s preliminary analysis and certain estimates, management expects that EBITDA before

exceptionals for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 52% lower compared to EBITDA


-----

before exceptionals of €814 million for the corresponding period in 2021 and approximately 23% lower compared to
EBITDA before exceptionals of €511 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2022. The fourth quarter
results were adversely impacted by non-cash inventory holding losses as a result of the large decline in crude oil and
product prices in the quarter. Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for the full year ended December
31, 2022 was approximately 21% lower compared to a record EBITDA before exceptionals of €3,616 million for the year
ended December 31, 2021. All of the Group’s sites have continued to operate fully during the on-going COVID-19
pandemic and supply chains have operated without significant disruption. High energy costs, particularly in Europe, and
continued high inflation rates have led to reduced demand levels and erosion of margins from the previous historic record
performance in the year ended December 31, 2021.

Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for O&P North America for the three-month period

ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 49% lower compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €344 million for
the corresponding period in 2021. Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for the full year ended
December 31, 2022 was approximately 24% lower compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €1,577 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021. Ethylene markets were generally weaker in the quarter with lower demand, improved
industry supply availability and reduced export opportunities. Polymer markets were softer with some erosion of margins
for most products in the quarter, although pipe markets remained healthy.

Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for O&P Europe for the three-month period ended

December 31, 2022 was approximately 62% lower compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €194 million for the
corresponding period in 2021. Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for the full year ended December
31, 2022 was approximately 31% lower compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €948 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021. Markets for olefins in the quarter were generally weaker with most industry crackers being trimmed
across Europe. Propylene markets were long with weak demand across most derivatives due to high energy costs.
European polymer markets were weaker with reduced demand and increased levels of imports.

Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for Chemical Intermediates for the three-month period

ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 49% lower compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €276 million for
the corresponding period in 2021. Management estimates that EBITDA before exceptionals for the full year ended
December 31, 2022 was approximately 10% lower compared to EBITDA before exceptionals of €1,091 million for the
year ended December 31, 2021. Overall demand in the Oligomers business was robust across the product portfolio, with
particular strength in co-monomers. Demand was weaker across most market sectors for the Oxide business, with some
pressure on margins due to high energy costs. Demand for the Nitriles business was mixed, with firm demand in the
United States, but softer demand in both Europe due to high energy costs, and Asia due to improved industry supply.
Markets for the Phenol business were balanced in the United States, but weaker in Europe.

Management estimates that net debt (including the Rain Facility) at the end of December 2022 was

approximately 9% higher compared to net debt of €5.7 billion at the end of December 2021. Management estimates that
cash balances at the end of December 2022 were approximately 25% higher compared to €2,106 million at the end of
December 2021, and availability under undrawn working capital facilities at the end of December 2022 was
approximately 21% lower compared to €782 million at the end of December 2021. Management estimates that net debt
leverage (excluding the Rain Facility and leases) was approximately 2.0 times EBITDA before exceptionals as at
December 31, 2022.

The information as of and for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 and the full year ended

December 31, 2022 is based solely on preliminary internal information used by management. Our annual financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 have not yet been completed. This information is preliminary and
based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and may change. It may not be indicative of
the actual financial quarterly results or financial condition as of quarter end and may not be indicative of any other
period. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”

**Other Recent Developments**

On November 8, 2022, the Group entered into an incremental term loan facility under the Senior Secured Term

Loans Agreement to borrow an additional €800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027-II Initial Euro Senior
Secured Term Loans and $1,200.0 million aggregate principal amount 2027-II Dollar Senior Secured Term Loans, the
proceeds of which were used, among other things, to repay a portion of the 2024 Senior Secured Term Loans. In
addition, in November 2022, we amended and extended the existing Rafnes Facility, resulting in an additional drawdown
of €126.5 million for general corporate purposes.

In December 2022, the Group completed the acquisition, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary, of a 50% interest

in the SECCO joint venture for approximately €1.5 billion, which was partly funded by a new RMB 1,045 million and
$525.0 million term loan facility. In December 2022, the Group also entered into the financing arrangements for Project


-----

ONE. We expect the Project ONE Facilities to be drawn in stages, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and throughout
the construction period to 2026. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Rain Facility” and “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.” In December 2022, the Group repaid in full the €141.0 million floating rate
Schuldschein Loan, which was originally due to mature in March 2024.

In December 2022, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of the 50% share in the Tianjin Nangang

Ethylene Project, subject to regulatory approval. The majority of the construction cost is expected to be funded through
project financing and, as a result, the approximate purchase price of the Group’s equity is expected to be RMB 5 billion
($0.7 billion), to be paid on completion. The complex includes the first of the 500 ktpa HDPE plants previously
announced by the Group and SINOPEC in July 2022.

Until December 2022, the INEOS Group held certain ordinary shares in INEOS Investments and INEOS

Investments was, until such time, consolidated into our financial statements. The ordinary shares were sold to an affiliate
that is not part of the Group in December 2022.

of the Parent’s consolidated EBITDA before exceptionals for the same period and
hold approximately 6.9% of the Parent’s consolidated total assets as of September

-----

Each Guarantor will also guarantee the Senior Secured Term Loans, the May
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025
Senior Secured Notes on a pari passu basis. The obligations of each Guarantor
will be subject to various limitations. See “Limitations on Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Guarantees and Collateral
limitations—The guarantees and pledges of Collateral will be subject to certain
limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to
certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”

**Ranking of the Guarantees .......... The guarantee of each Guarantor will, subject to any limitation of guarantee, be a**

general senior secured obligation of such Guarantor and:

                          - will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future obligations
of such Guarantor that are not subordinated in right of payment to such
guarantee, including with respect to the guarantee of the Notes by each

May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
2025 Senior Secured Notes, the guarantees by IGH and IHL under the Rain

service undertaking by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. under the Project
ONE Facilities;

                          - will rank effectively senior to all existing and future obligations of such
Guarantor that are unsecured or secured by liens junior to the liens securing
the guarantees to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

                          - will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of
such Guarantor that are subordinated in right of payment to such guarantee;
and

                          - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future obligations and
other liabilities of such Guarantor that are secured by liens senior to the liens
securing such guarantee, or secured by property and assets that do not secure
such guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such obligations and other liabilities.

**Security; Enforcement of** Subject to the terms of the security documents, no later than 30 days after the

**Security ......................................** Issue Date or, in the case of certain deposit accounts and security account control

agreements and in the case of certain real property collateral, 60 and 90 days after
the Issue Date, respectively, the Notes and the related guarantees will be secured
by first-priority liens (subject to certain exceptions) on the same assets that secure
the Senior Secured Term Loans, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. See also “Risk
Factors—Post Closing Collateral—The Post Closing Collateral will not initially
secure the Notes.”

Certain security interests will, as a matter of local law, be granted as junior
ranking security interests in relation to the security granted in respect of the
Senior Secured Term Loans, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Nevertheless, the
Intercreditor Deed provides that as a contractual matter among Senior Secured
Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the Notes will be secured on a
_pari passu basis with the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior_
Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans,
certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations and will be
treated as such for purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement
of such Collateral.


-----

The existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans, the May
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025
Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York, Luxembourg and
Norwegian law will remain in place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some
jurisdictions, the security documents creating the existing first-ranking liens
securing the Senior Secured Term Loans, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes will be
amended to extend such liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that
these liens extend) to the Notes (or, with respect to French and certain of the
German security interests, junior ranking security interests will be granted). The
existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans, the May
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025
Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Scottish law, Jersey
law and Singapore law will remain in place, and new liens over the same
Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure the Notes. In these
jurisdictions where new liens are created, the ranking of these new liens relative
to the existing liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of
factors, such as the nature of the liens, the order of creation of the liens,
compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the
liens and the order of giving notices with respect to the liens, and accordingly
without the Intercreditor Deed, the new liens would be likely to rank after the
existing liens. However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that, as a contractual
matter, the liens securing the Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Term Loans will rank pari passu and will be treated as having equal
priority with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any
Collateral. See “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees.”

The liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Term Loans, the May
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025
Senior Secured Notes are already in place and will continue to remain in place
and will either be amended to extend the security to the Notes, or, as mentioned
above, new junior ranking liens will be created.

In addition, the Intercreditor Deed will provide that a simple majority in
aggregate amount of all senior secured debt (including the Notes, any additional
Notes, certain hedging obligations, certain cash management obligations, the
Senior Secured Term Loans, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and any other senior
secured notes or credit facilities that are permitted to be issued under the
Indenture and that the trustees or lenders in respect thereof accede to the
Intercreditor Deed) under the Intercreditor Deed can instruct the Security Trustee
with respect to enforcement of the security. For a description of security
enforcement and other intercreditor provisions, please see “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.”

**Additional Amounts ..................... All payments paid by or on behalf of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any surviving**

entity under or with respect to the Notes or any guarantee under the Notes will be
made free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account
of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment, withholding or other
governmental charges (including, without limitation, penalties, interest and other
similar liabilities related thereto) of whatever nature (collectively, “Taxes”),
unless such withholding or deduction is required by law or by the interpretation or
administration of law, or by an applicable certification, identification, information
or other reporting requirement or agreement, if entering into or complying with
such requirement or agreement is required by law of a taxing authority therein or
political subdivision thereof as a precondition to relief or exemption from such
Tax. If any amount for, or on account of Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf
of any jurisdiction in which the Issuer, any Guarantor or, if applicable, any
surviving entity is incorporated, organized or otherwise subject to Tax or from or
through which any of the foregoing makes any payment on the Notes or by any
taxing authority therein or political subdivision thereof, is required to be withheld
or deducted from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or any
guarantee, the Issuer, Guarantor or surviving entity, as the case may be, will pay
such additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
received after such withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount that
would have been received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or
deducted, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of the Notes—Payment
of Additional Amounts.”

**Optional Redemption of Notes .... Prior to February 15, 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at**

a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the
applicable “make-whole” premium set forth in this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

On or after February 15, 2025, the Issuer may redeem all or a portion of the Notes
at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum under the caption
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the redemption date.

In addition, at any time prior to February 15, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds
from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.625% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes or 106.750% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Dollar Notes, as applicable, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the redemption date; provided that at least 50% of
the sum of the originally issued aggregate principal amount of the Notes of the
applicable series and the initial aggregate principal amount of any Additional
Notes of such series issued under the Indenture after the Issue Date remains
outstanding immediately after each such redemption and each such redemption
occurs within 180 days after the date of the relevant equity offering.

In connection with any tender offer, or other offer to purchase, all of the Notes, if
holders of not less than 90% of the Notes tender their Notes and such Notes are
purchased, the Issuer may redeem all (but not less than all) of the Notes that
remain outstanding. Such purchase may be made at a price equal to the highest
price paid to each other holder in such tender offer plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption
date. Please see “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**Optional Redemption for** In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all,

**Taxation Reasons ......................** but not less than all, of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus

accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined in “Description
of the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts”), if any, to the date of
redemption. Please see “Description of the Notes—Redemption upon Changes in

(1) Working capital represents net current assets (current assets less current liabilities).

(2) Total interest-bearing loans and borrowings represents net loans and borrowings after deducting debt issuance costs as presented in note 19
to each of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 11 to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.


-----

(3) Total indebtedness represents gross long-term interest-bearing loans and borrowings plus gross short-term interest-bearing loans and
borrowings before deduction of unamortized debt issuance costs. Under IFRS, debt issuance costs are deducted from the related debt
amounts for the purposes of balance sheet presentation and are amortized over the life of the debt. See “Presentation of Financial and
Non-IFRS Information.”

(4) Net debt represents total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents. See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”

(5) The 2019 information is extracted from the restated comparative information in the 2020 Audited Financial Statements included in this
offering memorandum. The deferred tax assets balance as of December 31, 2019 was restated for a revision in the Parent’s calculation of
deferred tax assets in relation to unfunded defined benefit pension plan liabilities in Germany to comply with the requirements of IAS 12.
The restatement has led to a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in other reserves deficit of €71.6 million as of December 31,
2019 showing as comparative information in the 2020 Audited Financial Statements.

(6) EBITDA before exceptionals represents profit for the period before net finance costs or income, tax charges or credits, depreciation,
amortization and impairment, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method, profit on disposal of
investments, profit on disposal of fixed assets, and exceptional items as defined in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance
with IFRS, we use both the FIFO and weighted average cost methods of accounting for purposes of determining our inventory cost in
connection with the preparation of our audited annual consolidated financial statements. EBITDA before exceptionals is based on the FIFO
and weighted average cost methods of accounting for inventory used in connection with the preparation of such financial statements.
EBITDA before exceptionals is derived from income statement line items calculated in accordance with IFRS on a historical cost basis.
Although our EBITDA-based measures should not be considered a substitute measure for operating profit, profit, cash flows from operating
activities or other measures of performance as defined by IFRS, we believe that they provide useful information regarding our ability to
meet future debt service requirements. The EBITDA-based measure presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies. See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.” EBITDA before exceptionals includes the impact of IFRS 16
Leases. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16 Leases (of €194.7 million, reflecting €146.1 million in respect of the payment of the capital
element of lease liabilities and €48.6 million in respect of interest expense payable on lease liabilities for the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2022), our EBITDA before exceptionals for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022 is €3,067.9 million. See
“Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”

(7) Net cash interest expense comprises interest payable on senior notes, interest payable on bank loans and overdrafts and interest payable on
securitization, less interest income on bank balances (2021: €1.0 million, 2020: €2.5 million, 2019: €11.8 million, nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022: €10.0 million, nine-month period ended September 30, 2021: €0.5 million, twelve-month period ended September 30,
2022: €10.5 million). See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”

(8) Capital expenditures represents payments to acquire property, plant and equipment as recorded on the consolidated cash flow statements for
the periods indicated.

(9) _Pro forma net debt represents total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents giving pro forma effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions and the_
Transactions. Pro forma net debt does not include lease liabilities (which are recognized as indebtedness under IFRS 16 Leases) of
€1,201.0 million (composed of current lease liabilities of €174.7 million and non-current lease liabilities of €1,026.3 million) as of
September 30, 2022. Pro forma net debt also excludes (i) the Rain Facility, entered into in December 2022 by our Unrestricted Subsidiary
INEOS China Holdings Limited, with an aggregate principal amount of RMB 1,045 million and $525 million and guaranteed by IHL and
IGH and (ii) the Project ONE Facilities, entered into in December 2022, which provide for an aggregate principal amount of up to
€3.5 billion. We expect the Project ONE Facilities to be drawn in stages, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and throughout the Project
ONE construction period to 2026. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Rain Facility” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project
ONE Facilities.”

(10) Gives pro forma effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions as if they had taken place, with respect to unaudited pro forma net
debt, on September 30, 2022, and, with respect to unaudited pro forma net cash interest expense, on October 1, 2021. For presentational
purposes, euro equivalents of dollar-denominated indebtedness have been converted using an exchange rate of $0.9766 per €1.00, which is
the exchange rate used for our balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. The Bloomberg Composite Rate on March 6, 2023, was $1.0681 per
€1.00. The ratio of pro forma net debt to EBITDA before exceptionals excluding the impact of IFRS 16 Leases is 1.8x. The unaudited
consolidated pro forma financial information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the
actual consolidated financial position would have been if the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions had occurred on September 30,
2022, with respect to unaudited pro forma net debt, or October 1, 2021, with respect to unaudited pro forma net cash interest expense, nor
does it purport to project our consolidated financial position at any future date. See “Capitalization” and “Use of Proceeds.”

(11) _Pro forma net cash interest expense comprises cash interest paid on unaudited pro forma debt balances (excluding lease liabilities) assuming_
that the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions had taken place on October 1, 2021. Pro forma net cash interest expense is calculated as
follows:

† Unless otherwise indicated, euro equivalents of U.S. dollar amounts are translated at an exchange rate of $0.9766 per €1.00, which is the
exchange rate used for our balance sheet as of September 30, 2022. The Bloomberg Composite Rate on March 6, 2023, was $1.0681 per
€1.00.

(a) Represents the cash interest expense in connection with the debt incurred under the Notes.

(b) Represents the cash interest expense on the New Senior Secured Term Loans, applying an interest rate of 6.715% for the dollar denominated
term loans (assuming SOFR of 3.115% and an additional credit support adjustment of 0.1% on September 30, 2022 was applicable
throughout the period) and 4.685% for the euro denominated term loans (assuming EURIBOR of 0.685% on September 30, 2022 was
applicable throughout the period).

(c) Represents the cash interest expense on the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Senior Secured Term Loans after giving effect to
the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions, applying an interest rate of 5.615% for the 2028 Dollar Senior Secured Term Loans and of
6.965% for the 2027-II Dollar Senior Secured Term Loans (in each case, assuming SOFR of 3.115% on September 30, 2022 was applicable
throughout the period and, in the case of the 2027-II Dollar Senior Secured Term Loans, an additional credit support adjustment of 0.1%
was applicable throughout the period) and 3.435% for each of the 2027 Euro Senior Secured Term Loans and the 2028 Euro Senior Secured
Term Loans, and 4.685% for the 2027-II Initial Euro Senior Secured Term Loans (in each case, assuming EURIBOR of 0.685% on
September 30, 2022 was applicable throughout the period). To accommodate the phase-out of LIBOR for U.S. dollars, our Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement was amended to change the U.S. dollar interest rate benchmark thereunder from USD LIBOR to SOFR in
November 2022. See also Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Changes or uncertainty in respect of
EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks may affect our sources of funding, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow.”

(d) Represents cash interest expense on (i) the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, (ii) the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and (iii) the 2025
Senior Secured Notes.

(e) Represents the cash interest expense on the Securitization Program during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022.

(f) Represents the cash interest expense on the outstanding principal amount of the Köln CoGen Facility at the applicable rate during the period
and the cash interest expense on the outstanding principal amount of the Rafnes Facility at the applicable rate during the period after giving
effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions.

(g) Represents the cash interest expense on the Inventory Financing Facility during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022.

(assuming USD LIBOR of 2.81% throughout the period) entered into in connection with the acquisition of Gemini HDPE LLC, which is
wholly owned by INEOS through Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

(i) _Pro forma net cash interest expense is based on current interest rates. Debt under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Gemini Facility, the_
Rafnes Facility and the Securitization Program is floating rate debt. After giving effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions as
of September 30, 2022, such floating rate debt represented €6,438.0 million, or 69.4%, of our total gross loans and borrowings as of
September 30, 2022.

**RISK FACTORS**

**Risks Relating to Our Businesses and Industries**

**_Cyclicality of the petrochemical industry—Changing market demands and prices may negatively affect our operating_**
**_margins and impair our cash flows, which, in turn, could affect our ability to make payments on our debt or to make_**
**_further investments in our businesses._**

Cyclicality and volatility in supply and demand in the petrochemical industry may affect our prices and may

negatively impact our operating margins and cash flows and cause us to incur losses. For example, if industry margins
were to return to their 2001 or fourth quarter of 2008 or second quarter of 2020 levels or decline more significantly than
they have in the past, then this may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash
flow. Any cyclical downturn may affect our prices and may negatively impact our operating margins and cash flows and
cause us to incur losses. Furthermore, increased volatility in industry margins could have a significant impact on our
short-term results. In such cases, we would have to absorb any losses or borrow additional funds. If we experience
significant margin volatility or if we incur losses over a prolonged period and are unable to obtain additional funds, our
liquidity could be materially adversely affected and our ability to make debt payments could be impaired.

The relationship between supply and demand in the petrochemical industry in general, and in our various

petrochemical segments historically, has been highly cyclical. This is primarily because product supply is driven by
alternating periods of substantial capacity additions and periods in which no or limited capacity is added. Historically, the
markets for some of our products have tended to follow trends in economic growth and have experienced alternating
periods of constrained supply, causing prices and margins to increase, followed by periods of capacity additions,
resulting in oversupply and declining prices and margins. In response, companies typically reduce capacity or limit
further capacity additions, eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied. Any slowdown in growth for any
reason could have a disproportionately negative effect on industry margins for our petrochemical products. For a
discussion of the current market environment, see “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Overview—Key
Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,” “Industry and Market Overview—Olefins & Polyolefins—Market
Environment” and “Industry and Market Overview—Chemical Intermediates—Market Environment.”

Historically, margins in the petrochemical industry have been volatile due to a number of factors, most of which

are beyond our control. These factors include:

      - short-term utilization rate fluctuations due to planned and unplanned plant outages;

      - political and economic conditions, which drive rapid changes in prices for our key feedstocks, including the
price of crude oil, gas and naphtha;

      - customers’ inventory management policies; and

      - exchange rate fluctuations.

In addition, we and other petrochemical companies with large asset bases in Europe face pressures due to the

fact that many of our key customers in Europe are subject to competition with low-cost producers in Asia. If our
European customers are unable to successfully compete with Asian manufacturers, they could reduce their volume of
purchases, including from us, or cease making such purchases altogether. To a lesser extent we are also exposed to the
risk of our customers in North America being unable to compete in the global marketplace. Each of these risks could
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Raw materials and suppliers—If we are unable to pass on increases in raw material prices, or to retain or replace our_**
**_key suppliers, our results of operations may be negatively affected._**

Our margins are largely a function of the relationship between the prices that we are able to charge for our

products and the cost of the feedstocks and energy we require to make these products. The prices for a large portion of
our raw materials are cyclical and are correlated closely to the prices of crude oil. Prices of oil rose during 2016 and
continued to rise during 2017 and most of 2018, before falling again towards the end of 2018. Prices again rose in 2019,
but fell significantly in early 2020 on the back of global uncertainties when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and other major oil producing nations (“OPEC+”) were initially unable to reach an agreement on production
levels for crude oil, at which point Saudi Arabia and Russia initiated efforts to aggressively increase production. The
convergence of these events with the COVID-19 pandemic created the unprecedented dual impact of a dramatic decline
in the demand for oil as a result of the significant slowdown in the global economy coupled with the risk of a substantial
increase in supply. The result was a steep decline in oil prices during the first half of 2020, which negatively impacted
our margins due to inventory holding losses, however, price increases in the second half of 2020 mitigated full year

losses. Prices increased further in 2021 and have become more volatile as a result of sanctions against Russia imposed in
early March 2022. After having reached a peak mid-2022, prices have slightly declined since but, at the date of this
offering memorandum, remain significantly above 2021 levels.

While we attempt to match raw material price increases with corresponding product price increases, our ability

to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials to our customers is, to a large extent, dependent upon our contractual
arrangements and market conditions. There may be periods of time during which we are not able to recover increases in
the cost of raw materials due to our contractual arrangements or to weakness in demand for, or oversupply of, our
products. Specifically, timing differences in pricing between raw material prices, which may change daily, and product
prices, which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often, sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates
for increases, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on profitability. Even in periods during which raw
material prices decline, we may suffer decreasing profits if raw material price reductions occur at a slower rate than
decreases in the selling prices of our products. In addition, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek relief
in the form of lower sales prices. Furthermore, some of our customers take advantage of fluctuating prices by building
inventories when they expect product prices to increase and reducing inventories when they expect product prices to
decrease.

Recently, we have seen increasing pressure on our supply chain due to several factors, including labor

availability, global logistics and increasing energy prices, that are in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the global economy. See “—Outbreaks of disease— The outbreak of contagious
diseases may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.”
and “—Invasion of Ukraine—The ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.” If our suppliers are negatively affected by events beyond our
control, including unforeseen public health crises, terrorist attacks, wars and other political instabilities, they could
become unable to provide products and services as agreed, leading to follow-on consequences for our relationships with
our customers, subcontractors and other third parties. In addition, sanctions imposed on Russia in connection with its
conflict with Ukraine, Nordstream pipeline explosions and limitations on LNG imports can put severe pressure on gas
supply, which we rely on for our production. Russia provides a significant proportion of European gas supply and is one
of the largest global producers, putting pressure on regional and global markets. While this has been mitigated so far by
the warm winter, an increase of European LNG import capacity, high storage levels and increased usage of coal, we
cannot rule out future disruptions as demand increases.

Further, volatility in costs and pricing can result in commercial disputes with customers and suppliers with

respect to interpretations of complex contractual arrangements. Significant adverse resolution of any such disputes could
also reduce our profitability.

Climate change, and regulatory requirements related to addressing climate change, may also result in higher raw

material and energy costs, higher operating costs or supply chain disruptions, due to environmental impacts from
extraction and processing of raw materials, extreme weather events, extreme temperatures, or increased demand for
limited resources or renewable fuel mandates, which may also impact our operations and sales, including profitability
and customer retention. See “—Climate change—Existing and proposed regulations to address climate change by
limiting greenhouse gas emissions may cause us to incur significant additional operating and capital expenses.”

We obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from selected key suppliers. If any of these suppliers is

unable to meet its obligations under present supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the
necessary raw materials and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products. Therefore, volatility in raw
material prices or interruptions in supply could place increased pressure on our margins and reduce our cash flow, which
could impair our ability to make debt payments or make further investments in our business.

If we fail to maintain our relationships with our current suppliers, our suppliers offer pricing and other terms that

are not satisfactory to us or a supplier fails to supply raw materials that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements,
we may be unable to fill our customers’ orders on a timely and cost-effective basis or in the required quantities, which
could result in order cancellations, decreased revenues or loss of market share and damage to our reputation.

**_Global economy—Our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with economic_**
**_recessions and our customers’ access to credit._**

We face risks attendant to changes in consumer demand for goods that incorporate our products, economic

environments, increasing energy prices, rising inflation and changes in interest rates, and instability in securities markets
around the world, among other factors. In particular, a worsening economic climate can result in decreased industrial
output and decreased consumer demand for products including automobiles, consumer goods and building materials, all
of which incorporate our products. Adverse economic conditions affect consumer and business spending generally,


-----

which results in decreased demand for goods that incorporate our products and have an adverse effect on our results of
operations.

Our financial results are substantially dependent upon the overall economic conditions in the United States,

Europe and Asia. An extended recession in any of these locations or globally—or public perceptions that result in
declining economic conditions—could substantially decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our
business. During 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, margins and volumes were adversely impacted across all
regions, as numerous countries experienced lockdowns resulting in lower market demand. During the second half of
2022 and into 2023, an era of high interest rates, rising inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and climate chaos is
undermining economic confidence around the globe. Moreover, many of our customers rely on access to credit to
adequately fund their operations. The inability of our customers to access credit facilities may adversely affect our
business by reducing our sales, increasing our exposure to accounts receivable bad debts and reducing our profitability.

**_Currency fluctuations—We are exposed to currency fluctuation risks in several countries that could adversely affect_**
**_our profitability._**

Although we report our results in euro, we conduct a significant portion of our business in countries that use

currencies other than the euro, and we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations.

Our results of operations may be affected by both the transaction effects and the translation effects of foreign

currency exchange rate fluctuations. We are exposed to transaction effects when one of our subsidiaries incurs costs or
earns revenue in a currency different from its functional currency. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the
relative competitive position of our manufacturing facilities, as well as our ability to market our products successfully in
other markets. We are exposed to currency fluctuation when we convert currencies that we may receive for our products
into currencies required to pay our debt, or into currencies in which we purchase raw materials, meet our fixed costs or
pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. In particular, a large
proportion of our manufacturing costs, and our selling, general and administrative expenses are incurred in currencies
other than the euro, principally the U.S. dollar and the British pound, reflecting the location of our sites and corporate and
business support centers. In addition, a large proportion of our outstanding debt instruments is denominated in currencies
other than the euro, including the U.S. dollar. At the same time, although many of our sales are invoiced in currencies
other than the euro, our consolidated revenues are reported in euro. Our financial results in any given period are
materially affected by fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar, British pound and other relevant
currencies. If the value of the euro declines against currencies in which our obligations are denominated or increases
against currencies in which our revenues are denominated, our results of operations and financial condition could be
materially affected.

This could include the possibility of an increase in the amount of our U.S. dollar-denominated indebtedness

when converted into euro, as was the case in 2018 and 2019 when the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro
increased, before decreasing in 2020, increasing again in 2021 and most of 2022 and then decreasing again at the end of
2022 and the beginning of 2023.

**_Outbreaks of disease—The outbreak of contagious diseases may have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_results of operations, financial condition and cash flows._**

Around the world, governments have been taking measures since 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak,

including imposing quarantines, vaccine requirements and travel restrictions and closures of various institutions.
Additional measures may also be imposed in response to new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including such governmental actions, have resulted in significant disruptions
and uncertainty in economic activity around the world. The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and how much more
extensive it may become is still unclear, including in light of the recent increase of cases in China. Despite the
availability of vaccines, governments around the world have imposed and may continue to impose restrictions. In
addition, the lifting of restrictions could make it more difficult to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus if new variants emerge.

The adverse impacts the Group has or may experience due to COVID-19 or future contagious diseases or global

health pandemics include, but are not limited to:

      - infections and quarantining of the Group’s employees in areas in which the Group operates;

      - the Group’s ability to satisfy the terms of its contracts with customers in a timely or appropriate manner;

      - cancellations, delays or downsizing of projects by the Group’s customers;


-----

      - our customers, service providers or suppliers experiencing financial distress, filing for bankruptcy
protection or insolvency, going out of business, or suffering disruptions in their businesses;

      - weaker demand in all regions for some of our core products;

      - logistical complexities in, and disruptions to, personnel travel and equipment and supply delivery to certain
locations;

      - the need to introduce measures to reduce the Group’s costs and capital expenditure including reduction of
its global workforce, implementation of a hiring and salary freeze and executive pay cuts;

      - increased risk of impairments as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group’s
profitability;

      - liquidity challenges, including the inability to refinance debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on
commercially reasonable terms, if at all, exhaustion of borrowing capacity and the need to implement
liquidity preservation measures, as well as impacts related to delayed customer payments and payment
defaults associated with customer liquidity issues and bankruptcies;

      - structural shifts in the global economy and its demand for petrochemical products as a result of changes in
the way people work, travel and interact, or in connection with a global recession or depression;

      - the risk that the Group’s insurance coverage is not likely to cover losses associated with pandemics like
COVID-19 under its policies; and

      - cybersecurity issues, as digital technologies may become more vulnerable and experience a higher rate of
cyberattacks in the current environment of remote connectivity due to stay-at-home orders.

Although we have experienced no significant impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 and 2022 and do

not currently expect any impact in 2023 and beyond, the Group’s operations and financial results were negatively
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and any worsening of the current situation or the occurrence of new
disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the financial markets. The associated principal risks to

us as a result of this volatility in the financial markets include weaker currencies and the liquidity risk associated with
potential increases in borrowing costs and the availability of debt financing. The economic impact of COVID-19 and of
any future contagious diseases will depend on the continuing spread of the outbreak and the responses of the authorities
and the global community. Although the Group has taken various measures as of the date of this offering memorandum
to address the impacts of COVID-19, we can give no assurance that these or other measures implemented in the future
will be sufficient. The COVID-19 situation and any resurgence thereof is dynamic, and updates on travel restrictions,
shutdowns of non-essential businesses and shelter-in-place/stay-at-home orders are continually evolving. The extent of
the COVID-19 outbreak’s continued effects and any future pandemic’s impact on the Group’s operational and financial
performance will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the outbreak and other
variants and the government measures implemented in response, or whether widespread shutdowns return, all of which
are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic
or any future pandemic adversely affects our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, it may
also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this offering memorandum.

**_International operations—We are exposed to risks related to conducting operations in several different countries._**

We currently have manufacturing facilities located in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany,

Belgium, Norway and Canada. Notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our business is subject to risks
related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions.
Risks inherent in international operations include the following:

      - general economic, social or political conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse
effect on our earnings from operations in those countries;

      - risk of a widespread outbreak of an illness or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, the
timing and nature of which may differ across the various jurisdictions in which we operate, see also “—
Outbreaks of disease—The outbreak of contagious diseases may have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.”;


-----

      - compliance with a variety of laws and regulations, including sanctions, in various jurisdictions may be
burdensome, see also “—Compliance—We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws,
economic and trade sanctions or other similar regulations.”;

      - unexpected or adverse changes in laws or regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions may occur;

      - the imposition of withholding taxes or other taxes or royalties on our income, or the adoption of other
restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;

      - adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses;

      - intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce;

      - transportation and other shipping costs may increase;

      - staffing difficulties, national or regional labor strikes or other labor disputes;

      - the imposition of any price controls;

      - difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables; and

      - volatility of foreign exchange rates, see also “—Currency fluctuations—We are exposed to currency
fluctuation risks in several countries that could adversely affect our profitability.”

In addition, as we increase our footprint into new territories such as Asia, our business may be exposed to

further economic and geopolitical risks as well as political and social instability which may adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, certain markets in which we may operate in the
future are emerging markets that are rapidly developing and differ from the economies of most developed countries in
material respects, including the macroeconomic challenges they face, the rapidly evolving nature of their financial and
legal systems and the extent of government involvement. Operating in these markets presents certain risks, including
political and economic instability, the inability to protect contractual or legal rights, market volatility and liquidity, rapid
demographic and market changes, evolving laws and regulations in respect of the chemical industry, potential
expropriation or nationalization of property or assets, and comparatively underdeveloped legal, financial and enforcement
systems.

**_Invasion of Ukraine—The ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

On February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a military action against Ukraine, which has resulted in

sustained conflict and disruption in the region. Although we do not have operations in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine,
revenue generated in these countries is not material to the Group and, to date we have not experienced any material
disruption to our operations, the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly
unpredictable, this conflict could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in
energy and other commodity prices, financial markets, supply chain disruptions and changes in consumer or purchaser
preferences, as well as increases in cyberattacks and espionage. See “—Global economy—Our industry is affected by
global economic factors including risks associated with economic recessions and our customers’ access to credit.”

Russia’s annexation of Crimea, recognition of two separatist republics in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of

Ukraine and subsequent military action against Ukraine have led to sanctions being levied by the United States, the
European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the
Crimea, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called
Luhansk People’s Republic, including, among others, the removal of certain Russian financial institutions from the
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system, which can significantly hinder
the ability to transfer funds in and out of Russia. The situation is rapidly evolving as a result of the conflict in Ukraine,
and the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries or jurisdictions may implement
additional sanctions, export controls or other measures against Russia or other countries, regions, officials, individuals or
industries in the respective territories. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as any potential responses from Russia
or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and
financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further details
on sanctions see “—Compliance—We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, economic and trade
sanctions or other similar regulations.”


-----

While, to date, we have been able to manage the significant increase in energy prices caused by the conflict, by

passing that on to customers through higher prices, we are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and assessing its
impact on our business. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the conflict in Ukraine or its impacts in
Ukraine, Russia or Belarus as the conflict, and any resulting government reactions, are rapidly developing and beyond
our control. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant
and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time.
Any of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such
disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this offering memorandum.

**_Competition—We face significant competition in our industries, whether through efforts of new or current_**
**_competitors or through consolidation of existing customers, which may adversely affect our competitive position, sales_**
**_and overall operations._**

The markets for most of our products are highly competitive. We are exposed to the competitive characteristics

of several different geographic markets and industries. Competition in most of our industries is based primarily on price
and, to a lesser extent, on product performance, product quality, product deliverability and customer service. Our
principal competitors vary from business to business and range from large global petrochemical companies to numerous
smaller regional companies. Some of our competitors are larger and more vertically integrated than we are and therefore
may be able to manufacture products more economically than we can. In addition, some of our competitors have greater
financial, technical, research and technology and marketing resources than we do. Furthermore, some of our competitors
are fully or partially state-owned and could have broader goals than maximizing profits, such as investing in the
economies of their respective countries and providing local employment and therefore may continue to provide capacity
and products even at unprofitable price points creating downward pricing pressure on our products. As the markets for
our products expand, we expect that existing competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we
operate, further enhancing competition. All of the above could hinder our ability to compete effectively in the markets in
which we operate in the future and our competitive position and results of operations may suffer as a result. For example,
in the petrochemical industry in Europe, where the majority of our petrochemical assets are concentrated, and, to a lesser
extent, in North America, we face competitive pressures from companies with facilities in the Middle East, which enjoy
substantial cost advantages due to access to low-cost gas feedstock available in this region. In addition, our export
business in Europe faces competitive pressures from export businesses in North America (including our own North
American operations) due to the abundance and use of low-cost ethane in North America. These cost advantages are
particularly significant when oil prices are high, as has been the case in recent years. The competitive pressure we
experience could be exacerbated if the Chinese economy fails to grow as expected, in which case more of the product
manufactured in the Middle East to meet the growth expected in China could be redirected to Europe and North America,
potentially resulting in greater supply to these markets and corresponding downward pricing pressure.

In addition, a number of our customers are participants in industries that are undergoing consolidation. We

could lose these customers to competitors if they are acquired by, or consolidate with, other companies that have
relationships with our competitors.

**_Customers—We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers._**

Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to minimize or mitigate customer credit risk. Our

customers may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, restructurings and liquidations. These and other
financial problems that may be experienced by our customers, as well as potential financial weakness in our industry,
may increase our risk in extending trade credit to customers. A significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in
a customer’s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer, require us to assume
more credit risk relating to that customer’s receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that
customer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity.

**_Refining Divestiture—We are dependent on contractual arrangements with the Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs for_**
**_naphtha and if we are unable to obtain this feedstock from these entities, our businesses could be adversely affected._**

On July 1, 2011, we disposed of the Refining Business and the Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business to the

Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs. In addition, we disposed of the Infrastructure Entity to the Refining Business JV
(50.0%) and INEOS Investments (50.0%). See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra
Divestiture—The Refining Divestiture” for a more detailed discussion of the Refining Divestiture.

We have entered into several contractual arrangements with the Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs to allow the

INEOS Group to continue to receive the requisite feedstocks and access to entrepreneurial activities and utilities services,
including a long-term agreement for the continued provision of the naphtha supply that we have historically received
from the Refining Business, on substantially similar commercial terms as those that governed the inter-INEOS Group


-----

transfer for the supply of naphtha previously. However, there is no guarantee that (i) the Refining and Entrepreneurial
JVs will deliver the requisite feedstocks or access to entrepreneurial activities or utilities services, set forth in the
contractual arrangements, (ii) we will be able to find other suppliers to cover any shortfalls in the feedstock supplies,
entrepreneurial activities or utilities services that we require and (iii) any agreements we enter into with other suppliers
will be on terms as favorable as those under the agreements that have been executed with the Refining and
Entrepreneurial JVs. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Refining Divestiture.”

**_Acquisition of DEA UK, certain subsidiaries of Fairfield Energy and DONG Energy A/S Oil & Gas business by_**
**_INEOS Upstream Limited—We face a risk of loss if INEOS Upstream Holdings Limited is unable to repay the loans_**
**_extended to the related party._**

INEOS Upstream Limited has acquired natural gas assets in the North Sea from a U.K. subsidiary of DEA

Deutsche Erdoel AG, which is part of the LetterOne Group and from Fairfield Energy (collectively, the “2015 Upstream
**Acquisitions”) by way of acquiring certain of its subsidiaries. INEOS Upstream Limited is a wholly-owned, oil and gas**
subsidiary of INEOS Limited, thereby making it our affiliate. In connection with the 2015 Upstream Acquisitions, the
Group advanced a loan of $623.7 million to INEOS Upstream Limited, the proceeds of which have been on-lent to
certain of its subsidiaries. Following a corporate reorganization, this loan has been novated to INEOS Upstream Holdings
Limited. The loan is unsecured, matures in June 2024 and bears interest at 7% per annum.

On September 29, 2017, INEOS Upstream Limited acquired further natural gas assets in the North Sea through

its acquisition of the entire oil and gas business of DONG Energy A/S (the “DONG Acquisition”). In connection with
the DONG Acquisition, the Group advanced a loan of $376.2 million to INEOS Upstream Limited, the proceeds of
which were on-lent to certain of its subsidiaries. Following a corporate reorganization, this loan has been novated to
INEOS Upstream Holdings Limited. The loan is unsecured, matures in June 2024 and bears interest at 7% per annum.

As at September 30, 2022, the total aggregate amount outstanding on the 2015 Upstream Acquisition loan and

the DONG Acquisition loan was $617.1 million (€631.9 million).

In the event that INEOS Upstream Holdings Limited is unable to repay the 2015 Upstream Acquisitions loan or

the DONG Acquisition loan, the Group will suffer losses as a result.

**_Inability to maximize utilization of assets—We may be adversely affected if we are unable to implement our strategy to_**
**_maximize utilization of assets._**

Our results of operations are materially influenced by the degree to which we utilize our assets in order to

achieve the most efficient production volumes. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to implement our strategy of
maximizing utilization of assets in accordance with our plans or at all. For example, the number and length of
turnarounds (scheduled outages of a unit in order to perform necessary inspections, tests to comply with industry
regulations and any maintenance activities that may be necessary) and unplanned outages have had, and may in the future
have, an impact on our operating results, even if such outages are covered by insurance.

**_Joint ventures—Several of our petrochemical facilities are owned and operated in joint ventures with third parties._**
**_We do not control these joint ventures, and actions taken by our joint venture partners in respect of these joint_**
**_ventures could materially adversely affect our business._**

Several of our petrochemical facilities are owned and operated in whole or part by joint ventures with one or

more third parties. These facilities include Cedar Bayou in Texas, which is operated by Chevron Phillips Chemical
Company LLC (“Chevron Phillips”ֹֹ) in a 50/50 joint venture with Chevron Phillips, the Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical
Company Limited facility in Shanghai, China (“SECCO”), which is a 50/50 joint venture between an Unrestricted
Subsidiary of the Group and SINOPEC. The Group expects to complete, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary, another
50/50 joint venture with SINOPEC, the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project, which is currently under construction by
SINOPEC, is expected to be on-stream by the end of 2023 and includes a new 500 kta HDPE (High-Density
Polyethylene) plant. While we have a certain amount of influence over each of these joint ventures, we do not control
them and are therefore dependent on our respective joint venture partners to cooperate with us in making decisions
regarding the relevant joint venture. Moreover, the day-to-day operation of the relevant facilities is the responsibility of
the management team of the joint venture or our joint venture partner. Therefore, our ability to influence these operations
on a day to day basis is limited and we may be unable to prevent actions that we believe are not in the best interests of
our joint ventures or our Group as a whole. Any such actions could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_Climate change—Existing and proposed regulations to address climate change by limiting greenhouse gas emissions_**
**_may cause us to incur significant additional operating and capital expenses._**

Our operations result in emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), such as carbon dioxide and methane.

Growing concern about the sources and impacts of global climate change has led to a number of regional, national and
supranational legislative and administrative measures, both proposed and enacted, to monitor, regulate and limit carbon
dioxide and other GHG emissions. Compliance with these requirements may require us to install additional pollution
control equipment, purchase additional emissions allowances or credits or implement other operational changes, such as
use of alternative fuels, which could increase our production or compliance costs or, to the extent incurred by our
customers, negatively affect our profitability or demand for our products.

At the international level, many nations have agreed to limit emissions of GHGs pursuant to the United Nations

Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the “Kyoto Protocol.” Methane, a primary component of
natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products, are two of
the GHGs addressed by the Kyoto Protocol. Although the United States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol at this time,
all member states of the European Union and the United Kingdom have ratified it. As a result of commitments made at
the UN climate conference in Durban, South Africa in December 2011, certain members of the international community
negotiated a treaty at the December 2015 Conference of Parties in Paris (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement,
which entered into force in November 2016, requires developed countries to set targets for emissions reductions once the
Paris Agreement is adopted by those individual countries within their respective national or federal law. The European
Union committed in December 2020 to reduce GHG emissions in its member states to no more than 55% of 1990 levels
by 2030, on the condition that other major economies undertake to do their part in the global attempt to reduce emissions
and commit to taking steps to achieve net-zero GHG emissions in the EU by 2050. The European Climate Law, adopted
by the European Union in July 2021, includes legally binding targets to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and to reduce
net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Such targets are binding on all EU member states.

In the European Union, our GHG emissions are currently regulated under the European Union Emissions

Trading System (the “EU ETS”), an EU-wide system that imposes emissions limits and permits trading of allowances for
industrial GHG emissions. The EU ETS has become, and is expected to continue to become, progressively more stringent
over time, including by reducing the total number of allowances to emit GHGs as well as those that EU member states
will allocate without charge to industrial facilities and by introducing and/or increasing fees for allowances. Such
measures could result in increased costs for us to: (i) operate and maintain our facilities; (ii) install new emission
controls; (iii) purchase or otherwise obtain allowances to emit GHGs; and (iv) administer and manage our GHG
emissions program. In 2021, the value of our utilized emissions allowances under the EU ETS totalled approximately
€50.0 million, and future utilization values are expected to be similar (or less) for 2022 and 2023.

In line with the EU’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and a 55% reduction in GHG by 2030, on July

14, 2021, the European Commission released a number of legislative proposals collectively called “Fit for 55”. The
proposals envision significant changes to current EU ETS functions and requirements, including: new national limits on
GHG emissions, a new carbon border adjustment mechanism (“CBAM”) to impose carbon pricing on imports into the
EU of selected products, further reduction of free CO2 allowances allocated to heavy industry and extending emissions
trading requirements to additional industrial sectors. Specifically with respect to CBAM, under the proposal importers of
certain goods (initially including cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, hydrogen and electricity, as well as
certain precursors) would have to report emissions embedded in their goods in a transitional phase starting in 2023. Once
the definitive system is fully operational (expected in 2026), EU importers would also be required to surrender CBAM
certificates purchased at prices that correspond to the carbon price that would have been paid if the goods had been
produced in the EU (less any carbon price actually paid by the non-EU producer of the goods). Although the initial list of
goods covered by CBAM is limited, at this time it is not clear whether and when such list may be expanded to include
other imported goods, the process for obtaining carbon emissions information from non-EU producers or the cost and
availability of future allowances or CBAM certificates. The Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional
political agreement on certain points of the “Fit for 55” package in December 2022. The proposals are subject to the EU
legislative process, including adoption or implementation by individual member states, and at this time we cannot predict
the terms of any regulations that may be enacted in the future or the impact of any such regulations on our business,
operations or financial condition.

The United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 pursuant to Article 50 of the

Treaty on European Union (“Brexit”). Accordingly, the UK government is no longer subject to the EU legislation that
commits the EU member states to reducing carbon emissions, increasing energy efficiency and increasing renewable
energy production, including in respect of the European Climate Law adopted by the European Commission. In addition,
the United Kingdom is no longer a participant in the EU ETS. In January 2021, the United Kingdom implemented a UK
Emissions Trading Scheme (“UK ETS”). Like the EU ETS, the UK ETS has industrial sites receiving or purchasing
allowances to emit GHGs and surrendering one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Companies which emit
less GHGs than their allowances cover are able to sell the excess allowances, whereas those which emit more must buy

additional allowances through the UK ETS. At present, no agreement to link the carbon pricing systems in the EU and
the UK has been formalized. In addition, as a result of the Paris Agreement, in June 2019, the UK government enacted
legislation requiring reduction of GHG emissions to net-zero by 2050, including a target to reduce GHG emissions by
68% of 1990 levels by 2030, and more recently committed to a target to reduce GHG emissions by 78% of 1990 levels
by 2035. In connection with Brexit, the UK government also introduced legislation designed to transfer responsibility for
the Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”), which takes an integrated approach to controlling pollution and sets strict
industry standards for the most polluting industries, and the BAT Conclusion, which contain emissions limits associated
with Best Available Techniques (“BAT”), to competent authorities in the UK and to put in place a process for
determining future UK BAT Conclusions for industrial emissions. The UK government’s Clean Air Strategy for England
sets out actions for determining future UK BAT for industrial emissions. Our operations in the UK will continue to
operate under the legislative framework applied in the United Kingdom. The Environment Act 2021 received royal assent
on November 9, 2021, introducing certain provisions regarding targets, plans and policies for improving the natural
environment and certain other matters, including provisions relating to air quality. Commencement regulations to bring
certain provisions in the Environment Act 2021 into force have yet to be made.

In the United States, we are required to monitor and report to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

(“EPA”) annual GHG emissions from certain of our U.S. facilities. In addition, EPA has promulgated regulations under
the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), which subject the GHG emissions of certain newly constructed or modified facilities to
pre-construction and operating permitting requirements. Pursuant to these requirements, newly constructed or modified
facilities with the potential to emit certain quantities of GHGs are required to implement “best available control
technology,” which can include carbon efficiency standards, GHG emission concentration limits, specific technology
requirements or other measures. Significant uncertainty exists as to how newer or stricter GHG regulations will in the
future impact large stationary sources, such as our facilities in the United States, and what costs or operational changes
these regulations may require.

In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of

GHGs and numerous U.S. states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the
planned development of GHG emission inventories and or/regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. Although the U.S.
Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it, or additional U.S. states, may do so in the future, along with
other countries (in addition to the European Union), and we cannot yet predict the form such regulation will take (such as
a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate
any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such requirements, for example, to install emissions control
equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer and manage our GHG emissions program, or address other
regulatory obligations. Such requirements could also adversely affect our energy supply, or the costs (and types) of raw
materials we use for fuel. U.S. President Biden has stated that climate change will be a central focus of his
administration. In addition to re-entering the Paris Agreement, on January 27, 2021 U.S. President Biden issued a pair of
executive orders and a presidential memorandum setting out several administrative priorities undertakings focused on
climate change. In April 2021, the Biden administration announced a target for the country to achieve a 50-52%
reduction in GHG emissions compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and a goal of achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.
We cannot yet predict the form regulations or other binding obligations adopted by the United States, the European
Union or the United Kingdom to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement will take (such as a cap-and-trade
program, technology mandate, emissions tax, carbon floor price or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently,
estimate any costs that we may be required to incur in respect of such requirements, for example, to install emissions
control equipment, purchase emissions allowances, administer and manage our GHG emissions program, or address other
regulatory obligations. Such requirements could also adversely affect our energy supply, or the costs (and types) of raw
materials we use for fuel. Requirements arising from these, or different, regulations controlling or limiting GHG
emissions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including by
reducing demand for our products.

**_Environmental matters—We will have ongoing costs and may have substantial obligations and liabilities arising from_**
**_health, safety, security and environmental (“HSSE”) laws, regulations and permits applicable to our operations._**

Our businesses are subject to a wide range of HSSE laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we

operate. These requirements govern our facilities and our operations, including the manufacture, storage, handling,
treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, water consumption, and wastewater
discharges, air emissions (including GHG emissions), noise emissions, operation and closure of landfills, human health
and safety, process safety and risk management and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Many of our operations require
permits and controls to monitor or prevent pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and
revocation by issuing authorities. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating
expenditures to ensure compliance with current and future HSSE laws, regulations and permits or the enforcement of
such requirements.


-----

We expect that our operations will be subject in the future to new and increasingly stringent HSSE laws,

regulations and permit conditions and that substantial costs will be incurred by us to ensure continued compliance. We
anticipate that these laws, regulations and permit conditions, including in respect of GHG reduction commitments or
requirements, will continue to require us to incur substantial costs and impose additional operating and capital
obligations. Given the nature of our business, violations of HSSE requirements, whether currently alleged or arising in
the future, may result in substantial fines or penalties, the imposition of other civil or criminal sanctions, cleanup costs,
claims for personal injury or property damages, the installation of costly pollution control equipment, or restrictions on,
or the suspension of, our operating permits or activities. Our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory
authorities to assess compliance with applicable HSSE laws and regulations. If we do not predict accurately the amount
or timing of costs of any future compliance, remediation requirements or private claims, our environmental provisions
may be inadequate and the related impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in any period in
which such unanticipated costs need to be incurred could be material.

At certain sites where we operate, regulators have alleged, or we have otherwise identified potential or actual

noncompliance with HSSE laws and/or the permits which authorize operations at these sites. Some of these allegations or
instances of noncompliance are ongoing, and substantial amounts may need to be spent to attain and/or maintain
compliance. In addition, we have in the past paid, and in the future may pay, penalties to resolve such matters. Our
businesses and facilities have experienced, and in certain cases, are in the process of investigating or remediating,
hazardous materials in the soil and groundwater at locations where we operate and/or adjacent properties and/or natural
resources at public and private lands not owned by us.

Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related activities, and

may currently be subject to engineering or institutional controls or restrictions or may become subject to such controls or
restrictions in the future. We are currently, and from time to time have been or may be, required to investigate and
remediate releases of hazardous materials or contamination at or migrating from certain of these sites, as well as
properties we formerly owned, leased or operated. We are, and in the future may be, responsible for investigating and
cleaning up contamination at off-site locations where we or our predecessors disposed of or arranged for the disposal or
treatment of hazardous wastes. Under some environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as “Superfund,” liability can be imposed retroactively,
without regard to fault or knowledge, and on a joint and several basis. In addition, we could be subject to claims by
government authorities, individuals and other third parties seeking damages for alleged personal injury or property or
natural resource damages resulting from environmental contamination or hazardous exposure caused by our operations,
facilities or products. The discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to
investigate or remediate contamination at our facilities, could result in substantial unanticipated costs. We could be
required to establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations or liabilities and, if we fail to
accurately predict the amount or timing of such costs, the related impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations in any period in which such unanticipated costs need to be incurred could be material. In addition, HSSE laws
and regulations can impose various financial responsibility requirements on us, and pursuant to these requirements we
may be required to post bonds, create trust funds or provide other assurances that we will be able to address
contamination at our sites and comply with our decommissioning obligations once our facilities reach the end of their
useful lives.

Our operations involve the intensive use of hazardous materials and we have been from time to time subject to

claims made for damage to property or injury, including adverse health effects, to employees and other persons, resulting
from our operations. Claims made in the future could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial
condition or results of operations.

Our operations involve significant water usage, with material annual industrial water costs expected to be

incurred in 2022 and 2023 similar to those in previous years. Changes to the environmental regulations and other factors,
such as water shortages as a result of climate change, could increase the cost and/or limit the availability of water, which
would in turn impact our operating and production costs.

Our financial results may be adversely affected if environmental liability arises for which we are not adequately

indemnified, or from a disposal of assets or businesses for which we provided a seller’s indemnification in respect
thereof. Although we believe that the indemnities given by the selling parties from whom we have acquired assets or
businesses will help defray the costs associated with pre-acquisition environmental liabilities, our financial results may
still be adversely affected to the extent that:

      - the sellers do not fulfill their respective indemnification obligations;

      - we breach our obligations not to undertake certain activities that may aggravate existing conditions or to
mitigate associated losses;


-----

      - we incur indemnification obligations for other environmental liabilities owed as part of certain disposals of
assets or businesses; or

      - we incur significant costs for pre-acquisition conditions that are not covered by the indemnities.

**_Potential hazards—Our operations are subject to hazards which could result in significant liability to us._**

Our operations are subject to hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related use, storage,

transportation and disposal of raw materials, products and wastes. These hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather
(including but not limited to floods, hurricanes on the U.S. Gulf Coast or in Gulf waters or other adverse weather that
may be increasing as a result of climate change) and natural disasters, accidents, mechanical failures, discharges or
releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, transportation interruptions, human error, pipeline leaks and ruptures
and terrorist activities. These hazards can cause, and have caused from time to time, personal injury and loss of life,
severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment as well as environmental damages, and may result in
suspension of operations and the imposition of civil and criminal liabilities, including penalties and damage awards.
While we believe our insurance policies are in accordance with customary industry practices, such insurance may not
cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and
maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies,
including liabilities for violations of environmental requirements and contamination. In addition, from time to time,
various types of insurance for companies in our industries have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or,
in some cases, have not been available at all. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and
our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain. Costs associated with unanticipated events in
excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive or financial position
or our ongoing results of operations. For additional related disclosure, see “Business—Health, Safety, Security and
Environment.”

**_Compliance—We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, economic and trade sanctions or other_**
**_similar regulations._**

As a result of our international activities, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the various countries in

which the Group operates. In particular, our international operations may be subject to anti-corruption laws and
regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and the local
anticorruption laws of any jurisdiction applicable to us. In addition, our international operations may be affected by
sanctions and economic restrictions imposed by the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, the U.S. Office of
Foreign Assets Control, the European Union, the United Nations, or other law enforcement agencies or sanctions
authorities. Countries or jurisdictions that are subject to economic sanctions and export controls currently imposed by the
United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom include the Crimea, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of
Ukraine (in each case to the extent that such areas of Kherson or Zaporizhzhia are under control of Russia), the so-called
Donetsk People’s Republic, the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria. Such list of
countries or jurisdictions may change from time to time.

While we have developed policies, procedures and training designed to achieve and maintain compliance with

applicable laws, the Group could be exposed to investigations, claims and other regulatory proceedings for alleged or
actual violations of laws related to our operations, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation, trade laws and
sanctions laws. As there can be no assurance regarding EU, UK or U.S. enforcement policy with respect to economic
sanctions, it is possible that the relevant authorities could take a different view regarding our sanctions compliance
efforts, which could potentially lead to negative adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and
prospects. If we are found to be subject to any laws or regulations which we considered were not applicable, our policies,
procedures and actions may be in breach of such law or regulation and we may be subject to censure, prosecution, fines
or other negative consequences. Furthermore, laws, regulations or licensing policies on economic sanctions or export
controls could change and additional countries may introduce economic sanctions, export control or similar regimes. Any
alleged violation of current or future applicable laws or regulations, either erroneously or substantiated in the future,
could result in civil or criminal liability for us, our employees, entities or partners, the imposition of fines, or other
penalties, as well as negative publicity or reputational damage, and could materially and adversely affect our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Third parties—Our business and operations are subject to business interruption risks due to the actions of third_**
**_parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Due to the nature of our business, we are at risk of business interruption due to the actions of third parties. For

example, many of our vendors and subcontractors have operations that are also subject to HSSE risks, including those
associated with the use, storage and transport of hazardous materials. Any future HSSE-related incidents affecting our


-----

vendors and subcontractors may result in significant regulatory actions, fines and other penalties, including restrictions,
prohibitions or sanctions on their operations which could impair their ability to perform their contracts with us or could
otherwise subject us to claims or liability, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any facilities experience damage or temporary closures due to
incidents or events, including protests, caused by third parties, our reputation, business and results of operations may be
adversely affected.

**_Product stewardship regulation—Our business could be adversely affected by chemical safety regulation of our_**
**_products and raw materials._**

We use and manufacture hazardous chemicals that are subject to regulation by the European Union and by many

national, provincial and local governmental authorities in the countries in which we operate. In order to obtain regulatory
approval of certain new products and production processes, we are required, among other things, to demonstrate to the
relevant authorities that the product is safe for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product in
accordance with applicable regulations. The process of seeking approvals can be time-consuming and subject to
unanticipated and significant delays. Approvals may not be granted to us on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in
obtaining, or any failure to obtain or maintain, these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new
products, to continue distributing existing products and to generate revenue from those products, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business and prospects. New laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that
could result in additional compliance costs, confiscation, recall or monetary fines, any of which could prevent or inhibit
the development, distribution and sale of our products.

In addition, some of our products (including our raw materials) are subject to extensive environmental and

industrial hygiene regulations that require the registration and safety analysis of and, in some cases, impose restrictions
on, their component substances. For example, in connection with the European Union’s Registration, Evaluation and
Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation or the European Union’s Classification, Labelling and Packaging
(“CLP”) Regulation, any key raw material, chemical or substance, including some of our products, could be classified as
having a toxicological, health-related or otherwise adverse or relevant effect, including impacts on the environment, on
users of our products, or workers handling these products. In the event of such a classification, those key raw materials,
chemicals, substances and/or products could be banned or restricted for certain uses. The European Commission aims to
propose a revision of the REACH regulation in 2023. At this time we cannot predict the impact of any such revision. We
manufacture, process, or use certain substances classified as substances of very high concern under REACH, including 2methoxyethanol and Propylene Oxide, and the continued use of these substances may require authorization from the
European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). If we cannot obtain authorization, we may need to discontinue use of such
substances.

In June 2016, amendments to the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) became effective, and it is

possible that they could result in risk screening by the U.S. EPA of substances we produce or use, and this risk screening
could lead to new or more stringent regulatory obligations and/or restrictions, including prohibitions on manufacture and
sale of certain substances. On December 19, 2016, the U.S. EPA published a list of ten chemical substances that are the
subject of EPA’s initial chemical risk evaluations, as required by the TSCA. This list includes multiple chemicals we
manufacture, including carbon tetrachloride and methylene chloride. In order to prioritize additional chemicals for risk
evaluations, in 2019, EPA designated 20 chemical substances as high-priority and 20 chemical substances as
low-priority. These designations include 1,3-butadiene that we manufacture.

In Ontario, Canada, the Toxics Reduction Act (which was repealed on December 31, 2021) required a review of

the use of toxic substances including certain raw materials from which our products are synthesized. Among other things,
this statute required tracking, preparation and publication of toxic substance reduction plans and government and public
reporting. The Chemicals Management Plan, which was created in 2006 under the Canadian Environmental Protection
Act, 1999, governs the assessment and management of risks associated with chemical substances to human health and the
environment, including government and public reporting. Similar regulations are being considered in other jurisdictions,
including the United States, which could result in additional requirements, including notification, testing, labelling and
record-keeping obligations, on our operations.

We are further subject to emerging laws and regulations governing workplace exposure to certain chemicals.

For example, benzene has been identified as a genotoxic carcinogen. ECHA’s Committee for Risk Assessment (“RAC”)
proposed reducing the occupational exposure limit (“OEL”) for benzene to 0.05 ppm as the maximum allowable
concentration in air at workplaces in the European Union. In response, the EU Commission published the fourth revision
of the Carcinogenic and Mutagenic Directive (“CMD”) which sets out a revised OEL for benzene of 0.5 ppm for a
transitional period from April 2024 to April 2026 and 0.2 ppm from April 2026. The European Commission will assess a
further reduction of the OEL for benzene according to the CMD. The CMD also sets out a new OEL of 0.45 ppm for
acrylonitrile, a monomer used in many plastics, which becomes effective April 2026. Because we produce benzene and
acrylonitrile, we become subject to these OELs. As another example, butadiene has been classified as a known human


-----

carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the U.S. National Toxicology Program and EPA. The
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration currently limits the permissible employee exposure to butadiene. If
studies on the health effects of butadiene result in additional regulations in the United States or new regulations in Europe
that further restrict or prohibit the use of, and exposure to, butadiene, we could be required to change our operations,
which could affect the quality of our products and increase our costs.

Growing concern about the sources and impacts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) may also lead

to increased regulation of such substances in jurisdictions where the Group operates. For instance, in January 2023, the
U.S. EPA proposed a rule that would prevent the manufacture, processing, or use of an estimated 300 PFAS without a
complete U.S. EPA review and risk determination. In December 2022, the U.S. EPA also proposed a rule that would
eliminate an exemption that allowed facilities to avoid reporting information on PFAS when those chemicals were used
in limited concentrations. Such proposed regulations, and others adopted in jurisdictions in which the Group operates,
could require the Group to incur significant costs including, inter alia, relating to compliance, modifying operations and
altering product inputs.

The regulation or reclassification of any of our raw materials or products could result in a ban on its import,

purchase or sale, adversely affect the availability or marketability of our products, or require us to incur increased costs to
comply with notification, labeling or handling requirements, each of which could result in a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_ESG—A failure to understand, manage and provide greater transparency of our exposure to environmental, social_**
**_and governance (ESG) related risks may have increasingly adverse implications for us and our stakeholders._**

ESG-related risks may directly or indirectly impact our business and the achievement of our strategy and

consequently those of our key stakeholders, which range from our employees, customers, investors and suppliers, to
policymakers, regulators, industry organizations and local communities. A failure to transparently and consistently
implement our ESG strategy across our business may adversely impact our financial condition and reputation and may
negatively impact our stakeholders, who all have expectations, concerns and aims related to ESG matters, which may
differ, both within and across the markets in which we operate. For more information on our ESG strategy, see
“Business—Sustainability.”

**_ESG—Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders and other market participants with_**
**_respect to ESG performance and policies may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional obligations or_**
**_risks._**

Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to ESG issues, including those relating to

sustainable development, renewable resources, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change,
diversity and inclusion, workplace conduct, employee well-being, human rights, philanthropy and support for local
communities. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, lenders, employees and other
market participants are increasingly focused on ESG practices, performance and disclosures. In recent years, financial
stakeholders have placed increased importance on the environmental and social cost and impact of their investments and
consider that the petrochemicals industry faces ESG risks that some other industries do not. The increased focus and
activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to or increase the cost of capital, as investors and lenders
may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices.
We have made certain voluntary commitments with respect to ESG performance, for example achievement of 33%
reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 and achievement of net-zero by 2050. If we fail to meet applicable standards or
expectations with respect to these issues across all of our operations and activities, our reputation and brand image could
be damaged, we may lose the trust of our stakeholders (including investors, customers and employees), and our business,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, while we seek to report our ESG
practices and performance in alignment with certain relevant reporting frameworks and to engage with leading
sustainability rating agencies and other stakeholders, these frameworks and ratings providers may not be the same as
those evaluated by our stakeholders, may emphasize different aspects of ESG practices and performance, or may not
accurately reflect our ESG performance in certain respects. In addition, changes in consumer and market demands,
regulatory requirements and other ESG-related considerations may negatively impact our performance on key ESG
indicators or otherwise impact our reputation and accordingly our business and financial results.

**_ESG Risk Ratings—The third-party ESG Risk Ratings referenced in this offering memorandum may not accurately_**
**_reflect our risks based on environmental, social and governance matters. Any actual or perceived lack of transparency_**
**_or underperformance regarding ESG matters as a result of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from_**
**_investors, lender and other market participants may adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The impact of our ESG-related risks and practices, including with respect to various environmental, social and

governance matters in our business and in the local communities in which we operate, has been and will continue to be


-----

independently assessed by non-accredited ratings organizations and various stakeholders in the ESG community. These
rating agencies and stakeholders may not view our ESG policies as sufficiently transparent or consistent with their
performance standards or goals. If this view were shared in the broader ESG community, our reputation could be
damaged which, in certain cases, could effectively limit our access to capital markets and result in scrutiny regarding our
commitment to ESG principles and standards.

In addition, ESG ratings may vary among the different ESG ratings organizations and are subject to differing

methodologies, assumptions and priorities used by such organizations to assess ESG performance and risks. Each ESG
rating provider’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other ESG rating provider’s rating. There is no
guarantee that the methodology used by any particular ESG rating provider will conform with the expectations or
requirements of any investor or any present or future applicable standards, recommendations, criteria, laws, regulations,
guidelines or listing rules. As a result, our ESG ratings are not necessarily indicative of our current or future operating or
financial performance, our commitment to ESG standards and principles, or any future ability to service our indebtedness
including the Notes, and are only current as of the dates on which they were issued. Any ESG rating obtained by the
Group or its affiliates provides no guarantee as to the actual environmental and/or social impacts of the Group or its
affiliates. In addition, individual company ratings may be based on only publicly available information and in other cases
may be based on information supplied by the relevant companies. As such, the quality of information in respect of each
company included in our rankings may not be comparable and there may therefore be limitations on the utility of these
rankings. Prospective investors must determine for themselves the relevance of any such ESG rating information
contained in this offering memorandum or elsewhere in making an investment decision. Moreover, ESG ratings are not a
recommendation by us or any other entity or person to buy, sell or hold the Notes. Each of the Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates makes no representations as to the accuracy or validity of the ESG Risk Ratings and assume no liability with
respect to the consequences of any reliance that may be placed on this information. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, none of Sustainalytics, which has provided an ESG rating for INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as disclosed in
“Business—Sustainability—Sustainalytics Rating”, and EcoVadis, which has provided an ESG rating for INEOS AG,
one of our ultimate parent undertakings, as disclosed in “Business—Sustainability—EcoVadis Gold Award”, is subject to
any regulatory or other governmental oversight in respect of its determination of ESG ratings or the underlying
methodologies it uses to make such determinations and may revise or replace entirely the methodology it applied to
derive its ESG ratings. No assurance can be given that the ESG Risk Ratings will remain constant for any given period of
time or that the ESG Risk Ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by Sustainalytics or EcoVadis if, in their
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. The past or future issuance of any ESG ratings which reflect low
performance on ESG matters or high ESG-related risk, or are not consistent with our own views on our commitment to
implement ESG principles and standards throughout our business and our commitment to our business and local
communities as an ESG company, could adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**_Tax Burden—Our tax burden could increase due to changes in tax law or the application or interpretation thereof, or_**
**_as a result of current or future tax audits or investigations._**

Our tax burden is dependent on certain aspects of tax laws across several different jurisdictions and their

application and interpretation. Changes in tax laws or their interpretation or application could increase our tax burden. As
a result of future tax audits or other review actions of the relevant financial or tax authorities, additional taxes could be
identified, which could lead to an increase in our tax obligations, either as a result of the relevant tax payment being
levied directly on us or as a result of us becoming liable for tax as a secondary obligor due to a primary obligor’s (such
as, for example, an employee’s) failure to pay. Due to our international focus, we are exposed to tax risks, in particular
with regard to transfer pricing rules that apply in several jurisdictions. Pursuant to these rules, related enterprises must
conduct any inter-company transactions at conditions that would apply among unrelated third parties concluding
comparable agreements (the “arm’s length principle”) and provide sufficient documentation thereof, subject to particular
rules applicable to them in the relevant jurisdiction. Although we have adopted a transfer pricing policy, tax authorities
may challenge our compliance with applicable transfer pricing rules, and we therefore must seek to ensure that our
transfer pricing policies accurately reflect the operating model of our business. If any tax authority were to challenge our
arrangements, including with respect to exit charges, we could face a higher tax burden and be subject to tax penalties or
fines, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_Litigation—We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm_**
**_our business._**

We cannot predict with certainty the cost of defense, the cost of prosecution or the ultimate outcome of litigation

and other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in any litigation
and other proceedings may materially harm our business. Litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not
limited to, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, environmental, permits, health and safety,
joint venture agreements, mergers and acquisitions, labor and employment or other harms resulting from the actions of
individuals or entities outside of our control. For example, appeals contesting our environmental permit for Project ONE


-----

have been filed with the Council for Permit Disputes in Flanders, Belgium. We cannot rule out that they will lead to the
permit being revoked, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully complete Project ONE
within the anticipated timeframe or at all and meet our ESG targets and, if revoked after significant expenditure has been
incurred on the project, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In the case of intellectual property litigation and proceedings, adverse outcomes could include the cancellation,

invalidation or other loss of material intellectual property rights used in our business and injunctions prohibiting our use
of business processes or technology that are subject to third-party patents or other third-party intellectual property rights
or the imposition of license fees to be paid to the holders of any such third-party intellectual property rights. Litigation
based on environmental matters or human exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace or from our products could
result in significant liability for us. Adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.

**_Product liability—We may be liable for damages based on product liability claims._**

The sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims arising out of the use of, or exposure to, our

products or the chemicals in them. While most of our products have some hazardous properties, some of them, such as
acrylonitrile, require specialized handling procedures due to their acute and chronic toxicity. Furthermore, our polymer
products have widespread end uses in a variety of consumer industries, including food packaging and medical
applications. A successful product liability claim or series of claims against us in excess of our insurance coverage for
payments for which we are not otherwise indemnified or have not otherwise provided for could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flows. In particular, we could be required to
increase our debt or divert resources from other investments in our business in order to discharge any such claims.

In addition, we have licensed our polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, vinyl chloride

monomer, ethylene dichloride and acrylonitrile technologies to third parties. Generally, our licensing agreements provide
that any liability arising from the implementation of such technology is retained by us during the first 18 months of the
agreements. As a result, we are liable for any damages arising from the implementation by our licensees of our
technology during this period.

**_Key personnel—Our success depends on the continued service of certain key personnel._**

Our success depends in significant part upon the continued service of our shareholders, directors and senior

management, including James A. Ratcliffe, Andrew Currie and John Reece and the executive officers at each of our
business divisions. In addition, our future growth and success also depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and
motivate skilled managerial, sales, administration, operating and technical personnel. We generally do not have
employment agreements with, and we do not maintain any “key man” life insurance for, any member of our senior
management. The loss of one or more of our key management or operating personnel, or the failure to attract and retain
additional key personnel, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Relations with employees and service providers—We depend on good relations with our workforce and service_**
**_providers, and any significant disruption could adversely affect us._**

As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 7,300 employees (measured as full-time equivalents

(“FTEs”)) in our operations around the world, not including employees of our joint ventures. The majority of our
employees are unionized. In addition, a majority of our employees resides in countries in which employment laws
provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the United States. These employment rights may
require us to expend greater time and expenses in altering or amending employees’ terms of employment or making staff
reductions. For example, most of our employees in Europe are represented by works councils which generally must
approve changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits. Further, a labor disturbance or work
stoppage at any of our facilities as a result of any changes to our employment terms and conditions or for any other
reason could have a material adverse effect on that facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

We also use independent contractors to provide us with certain technical assistance and services. In certain

cases, we may exercise limited control over the activities and business practices of these providers and any inability on
our part to maintain satisfactory commercial relationships with them or their failure to provide quality services (including
as a result of work stoppages or labor disturbances at such providers) could materially and adversely affect our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Intellectual property—The failure of our patents, trademarks and confidentiality agreements to protect our_**
**_intellectual property could adversely affect our business._**

Proprietary protection of our processes, apparatuses and other technology is important to our business, including

our manufacturing activities. Our actions to protect our proprietary rights may be insufficient to prevent others from
developing similar products to ours. In particular, we may be unable to secure adequate protection or management of
intellectual property during capital investment projects, in particular in new countries and certain of the emergingmarkets jurisdictions in which we operate, or when key personnel leave our company to join a competitor, which may
weaken our intellectual property rights and undermine our competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of many foreign
countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and the United
Kingdom. Furthermore, any pending patent application filed by us may not result in an issued patent, or if patents are
issued to us, such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies.
Oppositions or other actions initiated by third parties may also limit the scope of our patents and other intellectual
property rights, thereby weakening our protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. You should be
aware that the expiration of a patent or the failure of our patents to protect our formulations, processes, apparatuses,
technology or proprietary know-how could result in intense competition, with consequent erosion of profit margins. In
addition, our competitors and any other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully
manufacture and market our products in a competitive manner, which could materially adversely affect our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Some of our patents and patent applications are jointly owned with third parties. In many countries, both owners

have full rights under a jointly-owned patent. In the absence of a specific agreement, such third parties may use our
jointly-owned patents to compete with us or grant a license to our competitors. In addition, co-owners may not cooperate
with us to enforce or to defend a jointly-owned patent where necessary to protect our rights.

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation and other trade

secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements
with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurances that:

      - our confidentiality agreements will not be breached;

      - such agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how; or

      - adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of these trade secrets
and know-how.

In addition, there can be no assurances that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through

independent development or other access by legal means.

In the past we have received communications asserting that our products or their applications infringe on a third

party’s proprietary rights. Currently, there is no material pending litigation against us regarding any intellectual property
claim but we cannot assure you that there will not be future claims. Such claims, regardless of merit, could subject us to
costly litigation and divert our technical and management personnel from their regular responsibilities. Furthermore, if
such claims are adversely determined against us, we could be forced to suspend the manufacture of products using the
contested intellectual property and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if
any such products are material to our business.

We may also initiate lawsuits to defend the ownership of our inventions and our intellectual property. Like

defending against litigation, initiating litigation relating to intellectual property rights is costly and may divert technical
and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Furthermore, we may not prevail in any such litigation or
proceeding. A determination in an intellectual property litigation or proceeding that results in a finding of a
non-infringement by others to our intellectual property or an invalidation of our patents may result in the use by
competitors of our technologies or processes and sale by competitors of products that resemble our products, which may
adversely affect our ability to compete as well as create increased supply and corresponding downward pricing pressure.

**_Cybersecurity—We are subject to cybersecurity risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft,_**
**_data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss._**

Our industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities.

For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and to process and record financial and
operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. Our technologies, systems
and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or
information security breaches, such as cyber-fraud, viruses, malware infections, or social engineering activities like


-----

phishing and employee impersonation, all of which could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring,
misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In recent
years, cyberattacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. These threats may arise
from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to alleged state-sponsored attacks. A
cyberattack may be generic, or it may be custom-crafted to target the specific information technology used by us. If, as a
result of such cyberattack, our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely
way, we may be unable to fulfil critical business functions, which could damage our reputation and have a material
adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Although our businesses’ IT governance, risk management and compliance programs provide availability,

confidentiality and an overall security approach to all systems and business processes, including cybersecurity controls
(like intrusion detection/intrusion prevention, firewalls, mobile device management, malware and virus protection,
notebook encryption, secure VPN access, network segmentation, industrial control system security monitoring, email and
internet security, security information and event management, threat and vulnerability management), any failure of these
programs could result in a cybersecurity incident. Increased reliance on technology carries with it an increased risk of
cybersecurity issues, including phishing and end point vulnerability, which has been particularly heightened in light of
the current environment of remote working in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our

systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will
likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to
investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Further, the General Data Protection Regulation
(Regulation (EU) 2016/679), came into effect in Europe in May 2018, which has created a range of new compliance
obligations, and increased financial penalties for non-compliance significantly. The General Data Protection Regulation
(Regulation (EU) 2016/679) has been incorporated into domestic law in the United Kingdom, with minor amendments,
by virtue of the EUWA. While our IT compliance programs contain certain procedures to cover GDPR by providing
records of processing activities, performing assessments on technical and organizational security measures and
stipulating contractual agreements with external service providers and business partners and our demand, change and
project management procedures have been implemented, which guarantee the involvement of the legal department and IT
security team to assess new business applications and systems, identifying GDPR relevance and security vulnerabilities
upfront, any failures of these programs could result in potential liability for our business, losses of confidential
information, reputational consequences, financial damages, higher insurance premiums, damage to assets, safety issues,
operational downtime or delays, and revenue losses, adversely impacting our prospects, results of operations and
financial condition. The significance of any such event is difficult to quantify, but may in certain circumstances be
material to the Group and could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Internal controls—If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not_**
**_be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud._**

We have designed and continue to design our internal controls with the objective of providing reasonable

assurance that (1) our transactions are properly authorized; (2) our assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or
improper use; and (3) our transactions are properly recorded and reported, all to permit the preparation of our
consolidated financial information in conformity with applicable accounting principles. We design our internal controls
through the use of internal resources, external consultants and, as the case may be, with joint venture partners.

Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,

assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control
systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how remote. Any failure to maintain adequate internal controls or to be able to produce accurate
consolidated financial information on a timely basis could increase our operating costs and materially impair our ability
to operate our business.

**_The Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture—Our Senior Secured Term_**
**_Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures impose, and the Indenture will impose, significant operating and_**
**_financial restrictions, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking certain actions._**

Our Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures impose, and the Indenture will impose,

significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions include limitations on our ability to:

      - make investments and other restricted payments, including dividends;

      - incur additional indebtedness;


-----

      - sell our assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

      - enter into joint ventures; and

      - make capital expenditures.

Our Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures contain, and the Indenture will contain,

covenants that may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue available
business opportunities. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related debt. If a
default were to occur, the relevant holders or the relevant lenders (as applicable) of such debt could elect to declare the
debt, together with accrued interest and other fees, immediately due and payable and, subject to certain limitations,
proceed against any Collateral securing that debt. Refer to “Description of Other Indebtedness” for further information.

**_Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or developments may prove difficult for us to_**
**_consummate._**

We have a history of making acquisitions and in the future we may acquire companies or assets engaged in

similar or complementary businesses to our own if we identify appropriate acquisition targets, including acquisitions of
interests from our joint venture partners. For example, in August 2022, we agreed to acquire the entire asset base of
Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals, which will add more than 1,000 kta of capacity, including for
cumene, phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A, upon completion (expected in the first quarter of 2023).
The acquisition is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we also intend to organically grow our
business. INEOS announced its major capital investment in Antwerp, Belgium on January 14, 2019 (“Project ONE”)
consisting of a new Ethane Steam Cracker and a Propane Dehydrogenation Unit, for the production of ethylene and
propylene, respectively, along with associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure. Following a strategic review in 2020,
INEOS has determined that the demand for propylene in the quantities previously envisaged was less urgent. As a result,
Project ONE was rescoped to only consist of an ethane steam cracker with a nameplate capacity of approximately 1,450
kta and associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure. Any additional European propylene capacity will be considered
separately in the future.

INEOS has selected Technip to provide the operating technology for the new ethane cracker. We believe that

Project ONE remains the largest investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to
be among the most environmentally-friendly of its kind. It is planned to be equipped with the best available technologies
with a high efficiency in use of raw materials and energy, CO2 emissions that are expected to be less than half of the
currently best performing similar units in Europe from the outset and a clear path to carbon neutrality on a Scope 1 and
Scope 2 basis within 10 years of start-up of the cracker. Latest estimates suggest that the project will represent a capital
investment of approximately €4 billion (of which approximately €1 billion is expected to be invested in 2023) largely
funded by debt secured on the Project ONE assets. With construction having begun in the summer of 2022, the plant is
anticipated to be completed in 2026. Our ability to successfully complete Project ONE is subject to, amongst other
things, certain permits and licenses, which may be revoked, for example, if one of the appeals issued against the
environmental permit for Project ONE is successful. See also “—Litigation—We are subject to certain risks related to
litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business.”

The success of the project and the ability to complete it within the expected budget and schedule will depend in

part on us adequately addressing any technical, regulatory, environmental, labor or other issues that may arise in
connection with building such a mega project. We may be required to make significant additional capital expenditure
beyond that planned or exceed the anticipated timeframe for Project ONE in order to resolve these issues. However, there
can be no assurance that the project will be completed or that it would be completed at the anticipated cost or within the
indicated timeframe, or, once completed, be able to operate at the anticipated rates or capacity. We may not be able to
successfully implement our strategic and operational initiatives for Project ONE, and an inability to realize the full extent
of anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we acquired an interest in the SECCO facility in Shanghai, China in a 50/50 joint venture of an

Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Group with SINOPEC. We expect to complete, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary,
another 50/50 joint venture in 2023 concerning the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project, which is currently under
construction by SINOPEC, is expected to be on-stream by the end of 2023 and also includes a new 500 kta HDPE (HighDensity Polyethylene) plant. We may not be able to successfully implement our strategic and operational initiatives for
these joint ventures, and an inability to realize the full extent of anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

However, restrictions in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture

may limit or preclude our ability to make certain acquisitions or capital expenditures. Further, we may use debt financing
for any permitted acquisitions or capital expenditures, which would increase our debt service requirements. In order to


-----

manage any acquisitions or development projects we successfully complete, we will need to expand and continue to
improve our operational, financial and management information systems. If making acquisitions or integrating any
acquired business or development projects divert too much management attention from the operations or our core
businesses, this could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any acquisition or development
project that we make could be subject to a number of risks, including, as applicable:

      - problems with effective integration of operations;

      - the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;

      - increased operating costs;

      - costs related to achieving or maintaining compliance with laws, rules or regulations;

      - the loss of key employees of the acquired company;

      - exposure to unanticipated liabilities; and

      - difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.

We cannot assure you that any acquisition or development project we consummate will ultimately provide the

benefits we originally anticipate. Furthermore, we may not succeed in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or
financing and completing potential acquisitions on favorable terms and development projects may experience delays and
cost overruns. In addition, we may make investments in joint ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries for future acquisitions
or development projects. In that case, such joint ventures or Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be bound by the
covenants in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Indenture (including with respect to limitations on
indebtedness and restricted payments, including dividends).

**_Credit and capital market conditions—Adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets may limit or prevent our_**
**_ability to borrow or raise capital._**

While we believe we have facilities in place that should allow us to borrow or otherwise raise funds as needed,

adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets could prevent us from obtaining financing, if the need arises. Our
ability to invest in our businesses and refinance maturing debt obligations could require access to the credit and capital
markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support cash requirements. If we are unable to access the credit and capital
markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

**_Pension plans—Significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions relating to pension costs_**
**_may adversely affect the valuation of pension obligations, the funded status of pension plans, and our pension cost._**

Our funding policy for pension plans is to accumulate plan assets that, over the long run, will approximate the

present value of projected benefit obligations. Our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to
measure pension obligations, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations at the measurement date and the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the
portfolio mix of invested assets may result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets,
particularly equity securities, or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets. Any change in key actuarial
assumptions, such as the discount rate, would impact the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded
status of our pension plans as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following fiscal years. Any declines in the fair
values of the pension plans’ assets could require additional payments by us in order to maintain specified funding levels.
Any decrease in interest rates will result in an increase of pension liabilities. Our pension plans are subject to legislative
and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictions.

**_Eurozone—Market perceptions concerning the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual_**
**_currencies within the eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could have adverse consequences for_**
**_us with respect to our outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated._**

The Eurozone continues to be heavily indebted, which has contributed to the instability of the financial markets.

Financial markets may continue to be negatively impacted by concerns about a slowdown in growth in certain economies
of the Eurozone and uncertainties regarding the overall stability of the euro and the sustainability of the euro as a single
currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual member states. Governments and
regulators have implemented austerity programs and other remedial measures to respond to these concerns around the
economies and financial system of the Eurozone, but the actual impact of such programs and measures is difficult to
predict.


-----

In the event that concerns around the economies and financial system of the Eurozone and the stability and

sustainability of the euro are not resolved, it is possible that one or more countries may default on their debt obligations
and/or cease using the euro and re-establish their own national currency or that the Eurozone may collapse. Should the
euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations and for parties
subject to other contractual provisions referencing the euro such as supply contracts would be determined by laws in
effect at such time.

The official exchange rate at which our euro-denominated debt instruments (including the Senior Secured Notes

and the Senior Secured Term Loans denominated in euro) may be re-denominated may not accurately reflect their value
in euro. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect
the value of our euro-denominated debt instruments and could have adverse consequences for us with respect to our
outstanding debt obligations that are euro-denominated, and, as we have a substantial amount of debt denominated in
euro, our financial condition may be materially affected.

Furthermore, a number of our debt instruments (including the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term

Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures) contain, and the Indenture will contain, covenants restricting our and our
subsidiaries’ corporate activities. See “Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Restrictive covenants in
our debt instruments—We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future
operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. If we default under these covenants, we
will not be able to meet our payment obligations.” Certain of such covenants impose limitations based on euro amounts
(e.g., the amount of additional indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur). As such, if the euro were to significantly
decrease in value, the restrictions imposed by these covenants would become tighter, further restricting our ability to
finance our operations and conduct our day-to-day business.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure**

**_Significant indebtedness—Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our_**
**_business, and we may be limited in our ability to fulfill our obligations with respect to the Notes and to use debt to_**
**_fund future capital needs._**

We are, and after the issuance of the Notes will continue to be, significantly indebted and as of September 30,

2022, after giving pro forma effect to the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions, we would have had total
consolidated loans and borrowings of €9,276.0 million as compared to total equity of €5,774.6 million. In addition, IHL
and IGH have guaranteed indebtedness of our Unrestricted Subsidiary, INEOS China Holdings Limited, under the Rain
Facility with an aggregate principal amount of RMB 1,045 million and $525.0 million. We also would have had €779.5
million available for future borrowings under the unused portion of our Securitization Program. In December 2022, we
also entered into the Project ONE Facilities, which provide for borrowings of up to €3.5 billion and are expected to be
drawn in stages, beginning in the first quarter of 2023. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences
to holders of the Notes by adversely affecting our financial position including, but not limited to:

      - requiring us to dedicate all of our cash flow from operations (after the payment of operating expenses) to
payments with respect to our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research and development, and other
general corporate expenditures;

      - increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, adverse general economic or
industry conditions;

      - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, competition or changes in our business or industry;

      - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;

      - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or exploring business opportunities; and

      - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt or greater financial
resources.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our

debt obligations, including with respect to the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness
will depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in
large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our
control. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow from operations nor obtain enough capital to service our debt
or fund our planned capital expenditures.


-----

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including indebtedness in

connection with any future acquisition and indebtedness in connection with any inventory financing or similar
arrangements. The terms of the Existing Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement permit, and the
Indenture will permit, our subsidiaries to do so, in each case, subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to our
current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future
could be structurally senior to the Notes, and may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes. For example, in
connection with Project ONE, we entered into project financing agreements to fund the majority of the capital
expenditure plus associated financing costs during construction. The indebtedness is secured by the Project ONE assets
and, during the construction phase, supported by a debt service undertaking provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc.
The Project ONE assets will not form part of the Collateral that secures the Notes. See also “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.”

For further information regarding our substantial leverage and for more information about our outstanding

indebtedness, see also “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**_Restrictive covenants in our debt instruments—We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability_**
**_to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities. If we default_**
**_under these covenants, we will not be able to meet our payment obligations._**

The Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures contain, and the Indenture will contain,

a number of significant covenants that restrict some of our and our subsidiaries’ corporate activities, including our and
their ability to:

      - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;

      - make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making other distributions and prepaying or
redeeming subordinated debt or equity;

      - create or incur certain liens;

      - sell, lease or transfer certain assets;

      - enter into arrangements that restrict dividends or other payments to us;

      - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances
and on the transfer of assets;

      - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

      - create unrestricted subsidiaries; and

      - consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.

All of these limitations are or will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the

Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance our future
operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest.

Also, the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement requires us and some of our subsidiaries to comply with

certain affirmative covenants. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Term Loans.”

Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These

include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, we
could be in default under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement. This would permit the lenders to take certain
actions, including declaring all amounts that we have borrowed under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement to be
due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. A failure to pay such amounts would also result in an event
of default under the Existing Indentures and the Indenture. If we are unable to repay our debt to the lenders, they could
proceed against the Collateral that secures the debt under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Notes,
certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities, and the Notes. If the debt under our Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Notes or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be
accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other debt.


-----

**_Securitization Program—We use the Securitization Program to meet some of our liquidity requirements, and are_**
**_subject to various covenants under the Securitization Program, which, if we are unable to comply with them, could_**
**_result in the acceleration of our debt._**

Unless the maturity date of the Securitization Program is extended, the Securitization Program will mature in

December 2024. We satisfy a significant amount of our short-term liquidity needs with amounts available under the
Securitization Program. While we have in principle agreed to terms with our securitization providers, our ability to
refinance the Securitization Program could be affected by a number of factors, including volatility in the financial
markets, contractions in the availability of credit, including in interbank lending, and changes in investment markets,
including changes in interest rates, exchange rates and returns from equity, property and other investments. Our liquidity
will be adversely affected if we are unable to refinance the Securitization Program on acceptable terms or at all, and we
can provide no assurance we will be able to do so.

The availability under the Securitization Program varies depending on the underlying receivables. For a more

detailed discussion, please see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Securitization Program.” In addition, the
Securitization Program contains various covenants, and if we fail to comply with these covenants, a default may occur
under the Securitization Program. If a default occurs under the Securitization Program, we may need to fund our working
capital requirements from other sources.

**_No Revolving Credit Facility—We do not have a revolving credit facility, which may adversely affect our short-term_**
**_liquidity._**

We do not have a revolving credit facility. While we believe we have sufficient cash on our balance sheet to

meet our working capital needs, such amounts may not be sufficient. Should we require cash in an amount exceeding the
cash available for cash collateralized letters of credit, our short-term liquidity will be adversely affected.

**_Ability to repay and service debt—To repay or refinance and service our debt, we will require a significant amount of_**
**_cash._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Notes, the

Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Notes, will depend upon our future performance and our ability
to generate cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. The ability of our subsidiaries
to transfer monies upstream to us, as well as to pay operating expenses and to fund planned capital expenditures, any
future acquisitions and research and development efforts, will depend on our businesses’ ability to generate cash in the
future, as well as limitations that may be imposed under applicable law. This, to an extent, is subject to general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, including those factors discussed in this “Risk Factors”
section or elsewhere in this offering memorandum, many of which are beyond our and our subsidiaries’ control. Please
see “Selected Consolidated Financial Information” and “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.” If we sustain
losses in the future, our ability to repay and service our debt may be materially impaired.

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our payment obligations, we may be forced to reduce or

delay planned expansions or capital expenditures, sell significant assets, discontinue specified operations, obtain
additional funding in the form of debt or equity capital or attempt to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt
on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely
basis or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement, the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, will limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. If
we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_Financing a change of control offer—We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control_**
**_offer required by the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, and, if this occurs, we would be in default under the_**
**_Existing Indentures and the Indenture._**

Under the terms of the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, we will be required to offer to repurchase or repay

the Existing Notes or the Notes, as applicable, if certain events constituting a change of control occur. Our obligations
under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement could also be accelerated upon the occurrence of a change of control
under the Existing Indentures or the Indenture or other change of control events. It is possible that we may not have
sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to repurchase any or all of the Existing Notes or the Notes, or repay our
outstanding obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement. We expect that we would require third party
financing to make an offer to purchase or repay, as applicable, the Existing Notes and the Notes or to repay our
outstanding obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement upon a change of control. We cannot assure
you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Our failure to repurchase or repay, as applicable, any or all of the
Existing Notes and the Notes would be an event of default under the Existing Indentures and the Indenture, respectively,
and would cause a cross default under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement. Similarly, a failure to repay the Senior

Secured Term Loans upon a change of control would cause a cross default under the Existing Indentures and the
Indenture. You should read the section titled “Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control”
for further information regarding the change of control provisions.

The change of control provisions contained in the Indenture may not protect you in the event of highly

leveraged transactions and other important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, recapitalizations,
mergers or similar transactions that may adversely affect you, because these transactions may not involve a change in
voting power or beneficial interest of the magnitude required to trigger the change of control provisions or, even if they
do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indenture.

Except as described under “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain

provisions that would require us to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring,
merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” under the Indenture will include a disposition to any person of “all or

substantially all” of the assets of Lux I and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of
case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of Lux I and its restricted subsidiaries
taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

**_Post-Closing Collateral—The Post-Closing Collateral will not initially secure the Notes._**

When issued, the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which represent 91.7% of the Parent’s

consolidated EBITDA before exceptionals for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022 and hold 87.0% of the
Parent’s consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2022 (in each case, calculated in accordance with, and in the
manner provided by, the guarantor maintenance covenant in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement as in effect on
the Issue Date after giving effect to the exclusion of the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement) and consolidated total assets of certain subsidiaries of the Parent (including Unrestricted Subsidiaries),
which represent approximately 1.1% of the Parent’s consolidated EBITDA before exceptionals for the same period and
hold approximately 6.9% of the Parent’s consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2022). Liens on Collateral to be
granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors will (subject to certain limited exceptions) be granted on the Issue Date. We will
agree in the Indenture to take such necessary actions so that no later than the dates so specified in the Indenture
(generally 30 days after the Issue Date, but in the case of certain deposit accounts and security account control
agreements and in the case of certain real property collateral, within 60 and 90 days after the Issue Date, respectively),
certain additional collateral that secures the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes,
certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities will be granted to secure the Notes (the “Post-Closing
**Collateral”). See also “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees,” “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of**
the Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “—Guarantees and Collateral limitations—The guarantees and pledges of
Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to
certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability.”

**_Finance Subsidiary Issuer—The Issuer is a finance company with no independent operations and is dependent on_**
**_payments under the Notes Proceeds Loan to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes._**

The Issuer is a wholly-owned finance company that conducts no business operations. It has limited assets, no

subsidiaries and a limited ability to generate revenues. Upon completion of the Offering, the only significant assets of the
Issuer will be its rights under each of the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and
the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans made by it to IHL. The Issuer’s material liabilities will include the
Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the euro-denominated Senior Secured Term Loans, the guarantee of
obligations under the dollar-denominated Senior Secured Term Loans and any additional debt it may incur in the future.

As such, the Issuer will be dependent upon payments from IHL in order to make any payments under the Notes.

If IHL fails to make scheduled payments on the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans
or the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans, it is not expected that the Issuer will have any other sources of
funds that would allow it to make payments on its indebtedness.

In addition, IHL is a holding company that conducts no independent business operations. The ability of our

subsidiaries to make payments to IHL to fund payments on the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Proceeds Loans and the Senior Secured Term Loans Proceeds Loans, and the ability of our subsidiaries to make upstream
payments in general, will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors
discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this offering memorandum.


-----

The payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to IHL by IHL’s direct

subsidiaries and such payments by its indirect subsidiaries to their respective parent entities are subject to various
restrictions. Existing and future debt of certain of these subsidiaries may prohibit the payment of dividends or the
making, or repayment, of loans or advances to IHL or its parent entities. The terms of the Intercreditor Deed also restrict
certain intra-group payments (other than payments under the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Proceeds Loans and the Senior Secured Term Loans Proceeds Loans). In addition, the ability of any of IHL’s direct or
indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the
subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws and other legal
restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments.

Although the Existing Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement limit, and the Indenture will

limit, the ability of IHL’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and
make other payments to IHL, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure
you that arrangements with IHL’s subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future
indebtedness of IHL’s subsidiaries will provide IHL with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on
the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans and the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro
Proceeds Loans when due. See “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of the Notes.”

**_Realization of Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and

other imperfections permitted under the Indenture. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes as well as the ability of the
Trustee to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first-priority ranking of security interests can be
affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory
liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Trustee are subject to practical problems generally associated with the

realization of security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes. For example, the Trustee or the Security Trustee may
need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Trustee or the
Security Trustee, as applicable, will be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of
any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Trustee or the
Security Trustee may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets and the value of the Collateral securing the Notes
may significantly decrease.

Furthermore, under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be

properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of
the security. The liens in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if
we or the Trustee or the Security Trustee fail or are unable to take the actions required to take to perfect any of these
liens.

In addition, our business requires a variety of national, state and local permits and licenses. The continued

operation of properties that comprise part of the Collateral and which depend on the maintenance of such permits and
licenses may be prohibited. Our business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely
affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or changes in applicable regulations or
requirements. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to
incur significant cost and expense. Further, we cannot assure the holders of the Notes that the applicable governmental
authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not
obtained or are delayed, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may result and the value of
the Collateral may be significantly decreased.

**_Sufficiency of the Collateral—The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the guarantees thereof granted under the Indenture are secured by security interests in the same

Collateral that secures the obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain
hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities. The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement and the Intercreditor Deed, including certain hedging obligations and cash management arrangements. Your
rights as a holder of the Notes to the Collateral would be diluted by any increase in the first-priority debt secured by the
Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

The value of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon a sale of such Collateral will depend upon many

factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in


-----

which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a
measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of the Collateral, or, if
such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges of an entity
may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The Collateral is located in a
number of countries, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the Collateral may limit the realizable
value of the Collateral. The Collateral will be released in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to the
Intercreditor Deed.

**_Limitations on the value of the Collateral—The Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that_**
**_have been granted as security for the Notes._**

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the

value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes. Not all of the INEOS Group’s assets secure the
Notes. For example, in connection with Project ONE, we entered into project financing agreements to fund the majority
of the capital expenditure plus associated financing costs during construction, which is secured by the Project ONE assets
that will not form part of the Collateral that secures the Notes. In addition, the assets of our Unrestricted Subsidiaries,
including the entities that own the Gemini assets and our Chinese joint venture interests, are not part of the Collateral. In
addition, in the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, whether
as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, is subject to agreed security
principles under the Indenture and, in certain circumstances, indirectly through the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement, subject to certain other agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders under the Senior Secured Term
Loans are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indenture may require such security to also be granted for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes. The agreed security principles set forth in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement
contain a number of limitations on the rights of the lenders to be granted security in certain circumstances. The operation
of the agreed security principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided
being limited or security not being granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed
security principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the assets securing the Notes and

other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior
unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for
the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before
the claims of certain unsecured creditors are paid.

**_Challenges to Collateral—The grant of Collateral to secure the Notes might be challenged or voidable in an_**
**_insolvency proceeding._**

The grant of Collateral in favor of the Security Trustee may be voidable by the grantor or by an insolvency

trustee, liquidator, receiver or administrator or by other creditors, or may be otherwise set aside by a court, or be
unenforceable if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the grantor is deemed to be
insolvent at the time of the grant, or if the grant permits the secured parties to receive a greater recovery than if the grant
had not been given and an insolvency proceeding in respect of the grantor is commenced within a legally specified
“clawback” period following the grant.

For example, if certain Collateral were secured after the Issue Date and the grantor of such security interest were

to become subject to a bankruptcy or winding up proceeding after the Issue Date, then any mortgage or security interest
in Collateral delivered after the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of
being avoided by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set
aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, you
would lose the benefit of the security interest. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the
Security Interests.”

**_Structural subordination—The Notes and each guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and any_**
**_preferred stock of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. Unless a subsidiary is a Guarantor of the Notes,

our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose.
Accordingly, you should only rely on the guarantees of the Notes to provide credit support in respect of payments of
principal or interest on the Notes.

Our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and those of our subsidiaries that do not

guarantee the Notes (including our Unrestricted Subsidiaries) have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any


-----

amounts due pursuant to the Notes or to make any funds available therefor, whether by dividends, loans, distributions or
other payments, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on, or principal of, the Notes. Generally, claims of creditors
of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of any preferred stockholders of the subsidiary, will
have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity,
including claims against IHL by the Issuer under the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds
Loans and the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans and by noteholders under the guarantees. In the event of
any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, the creditors of the Guarantors (including the holders of the Notes)
will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary’s assets and holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors
and preferred stockholders will generally be entitled to payment in full of their claims from the assets of those
subsidiaries before any Guarantor, as direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such
subsidiary. As such, the Notes, each guarantee, the Notes Proceeds Loan, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Proceeds
Loans and the Senior Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans are each structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries. For example, in connection
with Project ONE, we entered into project financing agreements in December 2022 for loans of up to €3.5 billion to fund
the majority of the capital expenditure plus associated financing costs during construction. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.” The indebtedness will be secured by the Project ONE assets and, during the
construction phase, supported by a debt service undertaking provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. The Project
ONE assets will not form part of the Collateral that secures the Notes and are all held by non-Guarantors.

**_Decisions regarding Collateral—Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

No later than 30 days after the Issue Date or, in the case of certain deposit accounts and security account control

agreements and in the case of certain real property collateral, 60 and 90 days after the Issue Date, respectively, the Notes
will be secured by the same Collateral that secures the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured
Notes. In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness
and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the liens on the collateral
securing our other secured debt.

The Intercreditor Deed provides that a common security trustee, who will serve as the Security Trustee for the

secured parties under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the
Indenture will (subject to certain limited exceptions) act with respect to the Collateral only at the direction of creditors
holding a simple majority of the aggregate amount of outstanding first-priority secured debt (including the Notes, any
additional notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging liabilities, certain
cash management liabilities and any other senior secured notes or credit facilities that are permitted to be issued under the
Indenture and that the trustees or lenders in respect thereof accede to the Intercreditor Deed) and only such creditors will
be able to instruct the Security Trustee to enforce the security. No noteholder will have any separate right to enforce or to
require the enforcement of the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.” As a result, the
holders of the Notes will not be able to force a sale of such Collateral or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of
a secured creditor under the relevant security documents for so long as any amounts under any other first priority senior
secured debt (including the debt outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
and any other senior secured notes or debt that are permitted to be issued under the Indenture, and that the trustees or
lenders in respect thereof accede to, the Intercreditor Deed) remains outstanding in an amount equal to or greater than
50% of the aggregate principal amount of the total first-priority senior secured debt. The creditors under the Senior
Secured Term Loans and the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Notes and they may not elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time
when it would otherwise be advantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Trustee sells the shares of our subsidiaries that have been pledged as Collateral

through an enforcement of their security interest in accordance with the Intercreditor Deed, claims under the guarantees
of the Notes by such subsidiaries and the liens over any other assets of such subsidiaries securing the Notes and the
guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed” and “Description of the
Notes—Security.”

It is possible that disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes, the holders of the Existing Senior

Secured Notes and the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement as to the appropriate manner of pursuing
enforcement remedies with respect to the Collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any
decisions of the creditors holding a simple majority of the aggregate amount of outstanding first-priority secured debt
(including the Notes, any additional notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, certain
hedging liabilities, certain cash management liabilities and any other senior secured notes or credit facilities that are
permitted to be issued under the Indenture and that the trustees or lenders in respect thereof accede to the Intercreditor
Deed), which may result in enforcement actions against the Collateral that are not approved by the holders of the Notes
or that may be adverse to you. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.”


-----

Further, the security interests in the Collateral that will constitute security for the obligations of the Issuer under

the Notes and the Indenture will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes, but rather to the Security Trustee on
behalf of the holders of the Notes. The Indenture will also operate so-called “Parallel Debt” obligations to satisfy a
requirement under the laws of Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and France (and any other applicable jurisdictions with
similar requirements) that the Security Trustee, as grantee of certain types of Collateral, be a creditor of the relevant
security provider or, in regard to Germany, the secured claim. The Parallel Debt is in the same amount and payable at the
same time as the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Indenture and the Notes (the “Principal
**Obligations”). Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and**
any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the
Security Trustee will have, pursuant to the Parallel Debt, a claim against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the full
principal amount of the Notes, holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy
of the Security Trustee. In addition, there is no assurance that such a structure will be effective before courts in the
governing law jurisdictions of the security documents as there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and
therefore the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. See “Limitations on Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_Release of Collateral and Guarantees—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes_**
**_under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the guarantees will be released automatically and under which the_**
**_guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, Collateral securing the Notes and the guarantees granted thereunder will be

automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, including:

      - in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of such Collateral (other than capital
stock in Lux I) to a Person that is not the Parent, a Parent Intermediate Holdco (as defined under
“Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”), Lux I or a Restricted Subsidiary (as defined under
“Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) or, subject to certain requirements, to any other Person
that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, in each case, if the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition does
not violate the requirements described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Sale of Assets” or is otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

      - if such Collateral is an asset of a Guarantor (other than the Parent any Parent Intermediate Holdco or Lux
I) or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”), in
connection with any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of capital stock of that Guarantor or
Subsidiary (or of the capital stock of any direct or indirect parent company of such Guarantor or Subsidiary,
in each case, other than the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, Lux I or the Issuer) as a result of which
such Guarantor or such Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale, assignment, transfer or
other disposition does not violate the requirements of the covenant set forth under “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets” or is otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

      - in the case of any Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee (as defined under “Description of the
Notes—Certain Definitions”) pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, any Security Document (as defined
under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) or the Intercreditor Deed or any additional
intercreditor deed (which release shall be of the liens on the property and assets, and capital stock, of such
Guarantor);

      - in connection with any Permitted Receivables Financing (as defined in the “Description of the Notes—
Certain Definitions”), which release shall be of the liens on receivable assets transferred in connection
therewith;

      - if Lux I designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture (which release shall be of the liens on the property and assets, and
capital stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary);

      - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as described
under “Description of the Notes—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture” and “Description of
the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

      - as described under “Description of the Notes—Modifications and Amendments” and “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

      - in connection with an enforcement sale pursuant to or other sales contemplated and permitted by the
Intercreditor Deed;


-----

- in the case of any Collateral (other than any capital stock in Lux I), upon written notice by Lux I to the
Trustee and the Security Trustee if the Collateral is intended to secure (A) Indebtedness incurred under
certain capital lease obligations or purchase money obligations or other Indebtedness of the Parent, any
Parent Intermediate Holdco, Lux I or any Restricted Subsidiary incurred for the purpose of financing all or
any part of the acquisition, development, construction or improvement of real or personal, movable or
immovable, property or assets (including Capital Stock) used or to be used in the business of Lux I and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, or any refinancing of any such Indebtedness, or (B) Indebtedness incurred under
any lines of credit, bilateral facilities, working capital or overdraft facilities or other operating facilities
permitted to be incurred by the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness”; provided that the Fair Market Value (as defined in “Description of the
Notes—Certain Definitions”) of all the Collateral released from liens under this provision of the Indenture
(excluding any portion thereof to the extent Liens thereon are subsequently granted in favor of the Security
Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, and with the Fair Market Value of any property or assets
being measured at the time of the release and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) does not
exceed €50.0 million in the aggregate;

- in the case of any Escrowed Proceeds (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”), in
accordance with the release provisions set forth in the applicable security documents creating liens thereon;

- with respect to liens on any Proceeds Loan (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain
Definitions”), upon the payment in full or other discharge of such Proceeds Loan (including as a result of
any merger or consolidation of the payor or the payee thereunder);

- to release and/or re-take any Lien on any Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of the
Indenture, the security documents governing the Collateral or the Intercreditor Deed or any additional
intercreditor agreement;

- to the extent set forth in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger, Sale of
Assets”, in connection with any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, sale, assignment, conveyance,

Notes—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger, Sale of Assets”;

- in accordance with the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Impairment of Security Interests”;

- with respect to all Collateral upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the
Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture;

- in connection with a Permitted Reorganization (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain
Definitions”);

- in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

- in connection with any inventory financing or similar arrangement incurred pursuant to clause (22) of the
definition of Permitted Indebtedness (as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness”) (which release shall be of the Liens on the inventory and related assets
transferred in connection therewith);

- if the Lien granted in favor of each of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured
Notes is released (only to the extent that there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets
constituting such Collateral that would result in the requirement for the Notes and/or the Guarantees to be
secured on such property or assets pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “Description of the
Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, it being understood that the foregoing limitation will not
be applicable to the extent that such Indebtedness is secured by a Permitted Lien, provided that, for the
purposes of this provision only, clauses (a) and (bb) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” in the
“Description of the Notes” shall not apply and clause (hh) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” in the
“Description of the Notes” shall not apply to any Indebtedness that was outstanding on the Issue Date);

- in connection with the funding of, or by, German pension trusts or in respect of sale and leaseback
transactions funded directly or indirectly by any such pension trusts;


-----

      - with respect to Liens on any Capital Stock of INEOS Belgium (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
Certain Definitions” and the entity that owns the Project ONE companies), any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that is not a Guarantor, any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Project Finance Entity
(as defined in “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”), in connection with incurrence of
Indebtedness by any such Restricted Subsidiary or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or by any such Project
Finance Entity; and

      - in the case of any Collateral, upon written notice by the Company to the Trustee and the Security Trustee, if
the release of the Lien on such Collateral is for bona fide purposes in connection with any commercial
transaction, so long as the Fair Market Value of the Collateral being released does not exceed €2.5 million
in the aggregate for any release or series of related releases (as defined in “Description of the Notes—
Certain Definitions”).

Under various circumstances, guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and terminated,

including:

      - with respect to any Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary of Lux I (a “Subsidiary Guarantor”), in
connection with any sale, assignment, transfer (including any transfer to certain joint ventures) or other
disposition (including by way of merger, consolidation or amalgamation) of all or substantially all of the
assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor (determined after giving effect to any substantially concurrent sales,
assignments, transfers or other dispositions to Lux I, a Guarantor or a Restricted Subsidiary) to a person that
is not (after giving effect to such transaction or any related transaction) Lux I, a Guarantor or a Restricted
Subsidiary, if such sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition does not violate the requirements of the
covenant set forth under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets”;

      - with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer (including any
transfer to certain joint ventures) or other disposition of the capital stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor (or
of the capital stock of any direct or indirect parent company of such Subsidiary Guarantor (other than the
Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, Lux I or the Issuer) that results in such Subsidiary Guarantor
ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary, if such sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition does not violate
the requirements of the covenant set forth under the heading “Description of the Notes—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets”;

      - with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, if such Subsidiary Guarantor is designated as an “Unrestricted
Subsidiary” in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture;

      - with respect to any Guarantor, as provided under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—
Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status” or “—Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries”;

      - with respect to any Guarantor, upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of
the Indenture as provided under “Description of the Notes—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of
Indenture” and “Description of the Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

      - with respect to any Guarantor, as described under “Description of the Notes—Consolidation, Merger, Sale

Default has occurred and is continuing;

      - with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, upon written notice from Lux I to the Trustee, so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; provided that, after giving effect to such release, the
Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) of the Issuer and the
Guarantors is at least 85% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Parent, Lux I and its Restricted Subsidiaries
and the consolidated total assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors is at least 85% of the consolidated total
assets of the Parent, Lux I and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case, calculated in accordance with, and
in the manner provided by and subject to the same exceptions as those set forth in, the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date (after giving effect to the modifications included in Exhibit
L-1 thereto);


-----

      - upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture; and

      - with respect to any Guarantor, upon written notice from Lux I to the Trustee, as part of any Permitted
Reorganization (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”).

**_Post-petition interest—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to secure post-petition_**
**_interest in the United States._**

In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding against us in the

United States, holders of the Notes will only be entitled to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to the
extent that the value of their security interest in the Collateral is greater than their pre-bankruptcy claim. Holders of the
Notes that have a security interest in Collateral with a value equal or less than their pre-bankruptcy claim will not be
entitled to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral
has been prepared in connection with the Offering and therefore the value of the noteholders’ interest in the Collateral
may not equal or exceed the principal amount of the Notes.

**_Controlling shareholders—The interests of our principal shareholders may conflict with your interests._**

Messrs. Ratcliffe, Currie and Reece own INEOS Limited, our ultimate parent holding company. Mr. Ratcliffe

controls INEOS Limited. Our controlling shareholder has power to elect all of the directors of our companies, to change
their management, to approve any changes to their organizational documents, and to approve any acquisitions or
dispositions. As a result, his actions can affect our strategic decisions, including the payment of dividends the size of
which may change or increase from time to time and may not necessarily be in line with past practice, our legal and
capital structure and our day-to-day operations. In addition, our principal shareholders may have an interest in pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including repurchases of our debt, on the open market or otherwise, that,
in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though these transactions might involve risks to you. In
the event of a conflict of interest between you and our principal shareholders, their actions could affect our ability to meet
our payment obligations to you.

**_Enforcement in multiple jurisdictions—Enforcing your rights as a noteholder or under the guarantees granted under_**
**_the Indenture or security across multiple jurisdictions may prove difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and will

be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are incorporated or organized under the laws of Belgium, England and Wales,
Germany, Jersey, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and certain states in the United States. In the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Belgium, England and Wales, Germany,
Jersey, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and certain states in the United States. Proceedings could also be
initiated in Canada, France or Scotland to enforce noteholders’ rights against Collateral located in Canada, France or
Scotland. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result
in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Your rights under the Notes, the guarantees
and the Collateral will be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be no
assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Guarantors’ jurisdictions of

organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in
the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and
duration of the proceeding. These laws in certain jurisdictions may limit the exercise of certain contractual rights (such as
terminating an agreement, claiming an accelerated payment or forfeiture of term under an agreement). Under these laws,
the Trustee may be restricted and prohibited from terminating the Indenture or declaring the Notes to be due and payable
following an Event of Default due to a Guarantor’s bankruptcy or insolvency. The application of these laws, or any
conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect
your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the guarantees and the security in those jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security
Interests” with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security

Trustee a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security
interests only give the Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes priority (according to their rank) in the distribution
of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Trustee and the holders of the Notes may not be able to
avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral.


-----

The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the Guarantors are organized limit the ability of these

subsidiaries to guarantee debt of, or provide security for, other companies. See “Limitations on Validity and
Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**_Prior ranking security interests—Any creditors with prior ranking liens will have prior access to proceeds of certain_**
**_Collateral and your rights to enforce your security over the Collateral are limited._**

To the extent that holders of other secured debt or third parties enjoy liens (including statutory liens) or other

prior ranking security interests, whether or not permitted by the Indenture, such holders or third parties may have rights
and remedies with respect to certain Collateral securing the Notes and the guarantees that, if exercised, could reduce the
proceeds available to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the guarantees. In addition, certain security interests
will, as a matter of local law, be granted as junior ranking security interests in relation to the security granted in respect
of the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes. The existing first-ranking liens securing the
Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes that were created under Luxembourg, Norwegian and
New York law will remain in place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some jurisdictions, the Security Documents
creating the existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes
will be amended to extend such liens to the Notes (or, with respect to French and certain of the German security, junior
ranking security interests will be granted). The existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans and
the Existing Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Scottish law, Jersey law and Singapore law will
remain in place, and new liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure the Notes. In these
jurisdictions where new liens are created, the ranking of these new liens relative to the existing liens will, as a matter of
general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the liens, the order of creation of the liens, compliance
with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the liens and the order of giving notices with respect to the
liens, and accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new liens would be likely to rank after the existing liens.
Therefore, you may not be able to recover on such security interests or, in respect of security interests under German law,
accessory security interests, because the beneficiaries of the senior ranking security interests will have a prior claim to all
proceeds from the enforcement of the same, although the Intercreditor Deed provides for certain pari passu rules of
allocation agreed as between the parties to it. See the specific local law security interests described under “Description of
the Collateral and the Guarantees—Summary of the Collateral and the Guarantees and Collateral for the Notes,”
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Description of Other
Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.”

**_Enforcement of French share pledges—Under the security interests governed by French law, you may be required to_**
**_pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges of the shares by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the_**
**_Collateral consisting of shares of INEOS France SAS or INEOS Technologies France SAS rather than by a sale of_**
**_such Collateral in a public auction._**

The pledges over shares of French companies may be enforced at the option of the secured creditor either by a

sale of the pledged shares in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors), by judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or by contractual foreclosure (attribution conventionnelle) of the shares to the secured
creditor, following which the secured creditor is the legal owner of the pledged shares. A judge (in the context of a
judicial foreclosure) or an expert (in the context of a contractual foreclosure pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a
judge), will value the Collateral (in this case, the pledged shares) and if the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of
secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay the obligor a soulte equal to the difference between the value
of the shares and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately
received by the secured creditors from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

Consequently, in the event (i) the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the holders of the Existing

Senior Secured Notes or the holders of the Notes decide to, and are entitled to, enforce the share pledges over the shares
of INEOS France SAS and INEOS Technologies France SAS through a judicial or contractual foreclosure and (ii) the
value of such shares exceeds the amount of the secured debt, such lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the
holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes or the holders of the Notes may be required to pay to the pledgor a soulte
equal to the amount by which the value of such shares exceeds the amount of secured debt.

If the value of such shares is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant

creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such shares, and the remaining amount owed to such
creditors will be unsecured.

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations and may only be enforced

following a payment default (including following acceleration) and up to the secured amount that is due and remaining
unpaid.


-----

**_Sufficiency of liens—We will not have the U.S. mortgage documents delivered at the Issue Date._**

In order to ensure that each of the U.S. mortgage liens secures the obligations under the Notes, several of the

mortgages already existing on the Issue Date may need to be amended and searches in the real property records where the
owned U.S. real property is located may need to be conducted. There can be no assurance as of the Issue Date that,
among other things, (i) the U.S. mortgages definitively secure the obligations under the Notes, (ii) the U.S. real property
encumbered by each mortgage includes all of the relevant U.S. property that it was intended to include, (iii) we own the
rights to the owned properties that we purport to own in each mortgage and that our title to such owned U.S. real property
is not encumbered by liens not permitted by the Indenture and (iv) no encroachments, adverse possession claims, or other
restrictions exist with respect to such owned U.S. real properties which could result in a material adverse effect on the
value or utility of such owned U.S. real properties.

**_Value of Collateral—The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We intend to continue to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in the manner described in this

offering memorandum. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable,
in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete or partial loss of
any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured obligations, including the
Notes and the guarantees. In addition, even if there is sufficient insurance coverage, if there is a total or partial loss of
certain Collateral, there may be significant delays in obtaining replacement Collateral.

**_Perfection of security interests—Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect_**
**_security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly perfected,

and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor, as applicable, of the
security. The liens in the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we
or the Security Trustee fails or is unable to take the actions we are or it is required, as the case may be, to take to perfect
any of these liens. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general
security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or
promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.

Prior to the renewal of certain registrations with the Belgian National Pledge Register on October 22, 2020 of

security interests on the Belgian security, the liens on the Belgian security for the benefit of the Senior Secured Term
Loans, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and the Schuldschein Loan did not
constitute, as a matter of Belgian law, first-ranking liens due to the failure of the security trustee under the Belgian
security documents to renew certain registrations with the Belgian National Pledge Register.

The Trustee and the Security Trustee will not monitor, or we may not comply with our obligations to inform the

Trustee or the Security Trustee of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the necessary action may not
be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired property or rights. Such failure may result in the
invalidity of the security interest in the Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the
Notes against third parties. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of
additional property or rights by us or the perfection of any security interest.

**_Guarantees and Collateral limitations—The guarantees and pledges of Collateral will be subject to certain limitations_**
**_on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and_**
**_enforceability._**

The Indenture will provide that certain guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that can be

guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under
applicable law and enforcement of each guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws
and defenses include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of
creditors generally. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws, a

court could subordinate or void the guarantees and, if payment had already been made under a guarantee, require that the
recipient return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court were to find that:

      - the relevant guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders
of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor
was insolvent when it granted the relevant guarantee;


-----

      - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the relevant guarantee
and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant guarantee;
(ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur,
or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity;

      - the relevant guarantees were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best
interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

      - the amount paid or payable under the relevant guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted
under applicable law.

The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing

law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

      - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets;

      - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on
its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or

      - it cannot pay its debts as they become due.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or a guarantee of the Notes was a fraudulent conveyance or

held it unenforceable for any other reason, the court could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes or such
guarantee are ineffective, or require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or
such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may cease to have any claim in
respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of the other Guarantors
under any guarantees which have not been declared void.

Additionally, any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Security Trustee, including pursuant to security

documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable by the pledgor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its
trustee in bankruptcy if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if the pledgor is insolvent
at the time of the pledge, the pledge permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the pledge had
not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge,
or in certain circumstances, a longer period.

In addition, under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted in the future to incur additional indebtedness

and other obligations that may share in the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes and the liens on the collateral
securing our other secured debt. The granting of new security interests may require the releasing and retaking of security
or otherwise create new hardening periods in certain jurisdictions. The applicable hardening period for these new security
interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security
interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such
jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective or it may not be possible to enforce it. Further, certain security
documents governing the security interests granted by the Guarantors will provide that the amounts guaranteed by such
security interests will be limited to the extent of the amount guaranteed by such Guarantor. Therefore, limitations in the
guarantees will also serve to limit the amounts guaranteed by the pledges of Collateral.

**_Insolvency laws—Relevant insolvency laws in England, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions may provide you with_**
**_less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law._**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, any

insolvency proceedings by or against the Issuer or such Guarantors would likely be based on English insolvency laws.
IGH and certain of the other Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Therefore, any insolvency
proceedings by or against IGH or such other Guarantors would likely be based on Luxembourg insolvency laws. The
other Guarantors are incorporated or organized or have assets located in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Jersey,
Norway, Scotland, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a description of the insolvency laws in Luxembourg, Belgium, Canada,
England and Wales, France, Germany, Jersey, Norway, Scotland, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, which
could limit the enforceability of the guarantees and the security interests.

The procedural and substantive provisions of the insolvency laws in many of the jurisdictions in which the

Guarantors are organized are generally more favorable to secured creditors than comparable provisions of U.S. law and
afford debtors and unsecured creditors only limited protection from secured creditors. The lenders under the Senior
Secured Term Loans and the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes have, and the holders of the Notes will have,


-----

first ranking security on substantially all of the assets of IHL and substantially all of the assets of the Guarantors. As a
result, after the enforcement of the assets securing the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes or
the Notes, the Senior Security Agent (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) at the request of the senior creditors under the
Intercreditor Deed whose senior credit participations constitute the simple majority in aggregate principal amount of the
total senior credit participations will have effective control of and the right to direct the disposition of the assets of IHL
and those subsidiaries.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors, any future Guarantors, if any, or any other of our

subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Guarantees
and security provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this offering memorandum are also subject to
material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any enforcement of the guarantees or security after
bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant
entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions
may be materially different from, or in conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other
creditors, the ability to void preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain
post-petition interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your
rights under the guarantees or the security in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts that you may receive.

**_Enforcement of civil liabilities—You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Issuer and most of the Guarantors are companies incorporated outside the United States. Most of our

directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United
States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United
States on our directors and executive officers or the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors. In addition, as
most of our assets and those of our directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be
unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the
Federal securities laws of the United States. In addition, we have been informed that it is questionable whether certain
non-U.S. courts would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if proceedings were commenced in such non-U.S.
jurisdictions predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of
Judgments.”

**_Lack of public market—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell_**
**_your Notes may be limited._**

There is no existing market for the Notes. We cannot assure you as to:

      - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

      - your ability to sell your Notes; or

      - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers of the Notes have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes

after completing the Offering. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the Notes and may
cease market-making at any time. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in our
financial performance or in the markets where we operate may adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market in
these Notes and the market price quoted for these Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market
will actually develop for these Notes.

Historically, the markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to disruptions that

have caused substantial volatility in their prices. Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors,
including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The
market, if any, for the Notes may be subject to similar disruptions. Any disruptions may have an adverse effect on the
holders of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there
will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your
holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock

Exchange and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market, we cannot assure you that the Notes will remain listed.
Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Euro MTF


-----

Market, the delisting of the Notes from the Official List may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the
Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow the Issuer to issue additional Notes in the future which could adversely

impact the liquidity of the Notes.

**_Transfer of the Notes—The transfer of the Notes is restricted._**

The Notes and the guarantees thereof have not been registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of

any jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See “Notice
to Investors.” We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Notes, and we do not have any
intention to do so. In addition, by acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on
behalf of any investor account for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an aggregate
principal amount of less than $200,000, in the case of the Dollar Notes, or €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes. It is
your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of Notes comply with these transfer restrictions and applicable law.

**_Book-entry interests—Certain considerations relating to book-entry interests._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in exchange for

book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the respective Notes.
After payment to the Paying Agent for onward payment to Euroclear and Clearstream or the DTC, as applicable, the
Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of
book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear,
Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear, Clearstream or the DTC, on the
procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the Indenture.
See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act

upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the relevant Notes.
Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate
proxies to do so from Euroclear, Clearstream or the DTC. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the
granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any consents, requests for waivers or other actions on
a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture, unless and until definitive registered

notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting
through Euroclear, Clearstream or the DTC, as applicable. The Issuer cannot assure you that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear, Clearstream or the DTC will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under
the relevant Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_Foreign currency exchange risks—You may face currency exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Euro Notes are denominated and payable in euro, while the Dollar Notes are denominated and payable in

dollars. If you measure your investment returns by reference to a currency other than the currency in which your Notes
are denominated, investment in such Notes entails foreign currency exchange-related risks due to, among other factors,
possible significant changes in the value of the euro or the dollar, as applicable, relative to the currency you use to
measure your investment returns, caused by economic, political and other factors which affect exchange rates and over
which we have no control. Depreciation of the currency in which your Notes are denominated against the currency by
reference to which you measure your investment returns would cause a decrease in the effective yield of such Notes
below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on such Notes is translated into the
currency by reference to which you measure your investment returns. There may be tax consequences for you as a result
of any foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from your investment in the Notes. U.S. investors with U.S.
dollars as their functional currency may have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses,
if any, as a result of investments in the Euro Notes. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Considerations.” You should consult your tax advisor concerning the tax consequences to you of acquiring, holding and
disposing of the Notes.

**_Interest rate risks—Certain of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing_**
**_our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

A substantial part of our indebtedness, including borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement,

bears or will bear interest at per annum rates depending on EURIBOR, LIBOR, SOFR and similar benchmarks, in each


-----

case adjusted periodically, plus a spread. Furthermore, we may incur additional indebtedness that bears interest at a
floating rate. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, thereby increasing our interest expenses associated
with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering the Issuer’s ability to make
payments on the Notes.

**_Changes or uncertainty in respect of EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks may affect our sources of_**
**_funding, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow._**

Some of our sources of funding are linked to EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks. See

“Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Secured Term Loans.” Various interest rate benchmarks are the subject of
recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, including the EU Benchmarks Regulation
(Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). The Bank of England has established the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (SONIA)
as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark in replacement of sterling LIBOR, and the publication of the one-week
and two-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars ceased immediately after December 31, 2021. In addition, immediately after June
30, 2023, publication of the overnight and 12-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars and the one-month, three-month and sixmonth LIBOR for U.S. dollars is expected to be discontinued. As a result of these developments, the Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement was amended in November 2022 to accommodate the phase-out of LIBOR for U.S. dollars. Any
further significant change to the setting or existence of EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks could affect
the ability of amounts available to us to meet our obligations under our sources of funding or could have a material
adverse effect on the value or liquidity of, and the amount payable under, our sources of funding. The discontinuation of
or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks could result in
adjustment to the conditions applicable to our sources of funding or other consequences as relevant to our sources of
funding including, without limitation, early redemption, discretionary valuation or other consequences. No assurance can
be provided that relevant changes will not be made to EURIBOR, SOFR or any other relevant benchmark rate or that
such benchmarks will continue to exist. Furthermore, under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the
administrative agent and the borrowers are required to endeavor to amend the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement to
replace EURIBOR or SOFR with a replacement benchmark rate in certain circumstances such as if EURIBOR or SOFR
is not available and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary, or if the supervisor for the administrator of
EURIBOR or SOFR announces a specific date after which EURIBOR or SOFR shall no longer be used for determining
interest rates for loans denominated in the applicable currency.

**_The Group may incur additional indebtedness, which indebtedness could increase its leverage and may have terms_**
**_that are more or less favorable than the terms of the Group’s existing indebtedness._**

The Group or its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt. Prior to the maturity of the Notes, we will be

required to refinance or repay certain other debt, including our obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement and the Existing Indentures. In connection with the Group’s financial strategy, the Group continually
evaluates different financing alternatives, and the Group may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access the debt
capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time. Any such offering or incurrence of debt will be made at the
Group’s election or the election of its relevant subsidiaries, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be offered
and sold pursuant to, and on the terms described in, an additional offering memorandum. The interest rate with respect to
any such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or greater
than the interest rate applicable to the Group’s existing debt, including, in the case of a refinancing, the debt that is being
refinanced, which would have a corresponding effect on the Group’s net cash interest expense on a pro forma basis. In
addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of pricing or incurrence of such debt and
may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Group’s existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would
be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders thereof and could be more or less favorable than the terms of the
Group’s existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that the Group will elect to raise any such additional debt or
that any effort to raise such debt will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or
incurrence, the amount or terms of any such additional debt. If the Group incurs new debt in addition to its current debt,
the related risks that the Group now faces, even in a refinancing transaction, as described above and elsewhere in these
“Risk Factors,” could intensify. If we are unable to obtain new debt financing as needed, we would have to consider other
options, such as selling assets; restructuring all or a portion of our debt before maturity; obtaining additional equity
capital; foregoing opportunities such as acquisitions; or reducing or delaying our business activities and capital
investments. For example, in connection with Project ONE, we entered into project financing agreements to fund the
majority of the capital expenditure plus associated financing costs during construction. The indebtedness is secured by
the Project ONE assets, that will not form part of the Collateral that secures the Notes, and, during the construction
phase, supported by a debt service undertaking provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. In addition, in connection
with our acquisition of the SECCO joint venture interest, our Unrestricted Subsidiary, INEOS China Holdings Limited,
incurred RMB 1,045 million and $525 million of indebtedness, which is also guaranteed by IHL and IGH. See also
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Rain Facility.”

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in the ratings of the Notes._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, the Notes satisfy the

Investment Grade Requirement (as defined under “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions”) and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at
which the Investment Grade Requirement ceases to be satisfied, certain covenants will automatically cease to be
applicable to the Notes and release the guarantees of the Notes (other than the guarantees of any parent of the Issuer). See
“Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants and Release of Guarantees on Achievement of
Investment Grade Status.” If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur additional debt or
make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. There
can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be
maintained.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

We intend to use the proceeds from the Offering, along with the proceeds from the New Senior Secured Term

Loans, to repay all of the outstanding Existing Senior Secured Term Loans due 2024 (the “Existing Senior Secured
**Term Loan Repayment”), general corporate purposes and pay related fees and expenses. See “Use of Proceeds.”**

On the Issue Date, we (i) borrowed the New Senior Secured Term Loans and (ii) made certain amendments to

the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement to reflect the New Senior Secured Term Loans and the evolving needs of the
Group (the “New Term Loan Borrowing”).

The Offering, the New Term Loan Borrowing, the Existing Senior Secured Term Loan Repayment and the

payment of related fees and expenses are collectively referred to herein as the “Transactions.”

We are carrying out the Transactions in order to extend our debt maturity profile and improve our liquidity.

Please see “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

(1) Working capital represents net current assets (current assets less current liabilities).

(2) Total interest-bearing loans and borrowings represents net loans and borrowings after deducting debt issuance costs as presented in note 19
to each of the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and note 11 to the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(3) Total indebtedness represents gross non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings plus gross current interest-bearing loans and
borrowings before deduction of unamortized debt issuance costs. Under IFRS, debt issuance costs are deducted from the related debt
amounts for the purposes of balance sheet presentation and are amortized over the life of the debt. See “Presentation of Financial and
Non-IFRS Information.”

(4) Net debt represents total indebtedness less cash and cash equivalents. See “Presentation of Financial and Non-IFRS Information.”

(5) The 2019 information is extracted from the restated comparative information in the 2020 Audited Financial Statements included in this
offering memorandum. The deferred tax assets balance as of December 31, 2019 was restated for a revision in the Parent’s calculation of
deferred tax assets in relation to unfunded defined benefit pension plan liabilities in Germany to comply with the requirements of IAS 12.
The restatement has led to a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in other reserves deficit of €71.6 million as of December 31,
2019 showing as comparative information in the 2020 Audited Financial Statements.

(6) EBITDA before exceptionals represents profit for the period before net finance costs or income, tax charges or credits, depreciation,
amortization and impairment, share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method, profit on disposal of
investments, profit on disposal of fixed assets, and exceptional items as defined in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance
with IFRS, we use both the FIFO and weighted average cost methods of accounting for purposes of determining our inventory cost in
connection with the preparation of our audited annual consolidated financial statements. EBITDA before exceptionals is based on the FIFO
and weighted average cost methods of accounting for inventory used in connection with the preparation of such financial information.
EBITDA before exceptionals is derived from income statement line items calculated in accordance with IFRS on a historical cost basis.
Although our EBITDA-based measures should not be considered a substitute measure for operating profit, profit, cash flows from operating
activities or other measures of performance as defined by IFRS, we believe that they provide useful information regarding our ability to
meet future debt service requirements. The EBITDA-based measure presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by
other companies. See “Presentation of Financial and Non IFRS Information.” EBITDA before exceptionals includes the impact of IFRS 16

**Overview**

We are one of the world’s largest chemical companies as measured by revenue. Our business has highly

integrated world class chemical facilities and production technologies. We have leading global market positions for a
majority of our key products and a strong and stable customer base. We currently operate 33 manufacturing sites in six
countries throughout the world. We are led by a highly experienced management team with, on a combined basis, over
100 years of experience in the chemical industry. As of September 30, 2022, our total chemical production capacity was
approximately 23,000 kta, of which 55% was in Europe and 45% was in North America.

We operate our business through three segments: Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers North

America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and natural gas, and
include olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived from olefins. Our products
serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including packaging, construction, automotive, white goods/durables,
agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Our highly integrated, world class production facilities and technological know-how allow us to process raw

materials into higher value-added products. In Europe, we own two sites integrated with crackers and polymer units.
Typically, these two sites account for approximately 76% of our European olefin and polymer volumes. The polyolefins
plants on our two major sites in Europe normally receive more than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated
crackers. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for our polymer business is supplied
by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas or by integrated third-party facilities, such as the Tesoro facility in
Carson, California. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are able to capture attractive margins across
the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply, reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and
optimize our product slate.

We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large scale, well invested, highly integrated facilities

strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1, 2007, we and our
predecessors have invested approximately €10.7 billion (including investments in divested assets) in our production
facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, and state of the art production units. This includes
significant investments of almost €3.5 billion in the last five years to further enhance our assets’ capabilities. We believe
these investments allow us to operate at lower cost and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enable
us to maintain positive margin and cash flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the
twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022, our revenue was €21.8 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was
€3.3 billion.

Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower our operating

costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed asset investments to expand
our capacity in higher value products, to enhance productivity at our existing facilities, and to reduce our fixed cost
structure through headcount reductions, production line closures and system upgrades. In addition, we have shifted our
product portfolio to focus on more differentiated products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium
pricing strategies designed to improve our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to
drive growth, create significant operating leverage and position us to benefit from volume recovery in our end markets.

Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets from

Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets from


-----

major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and Innovene in December 2005
represented a transformational milestone for our company, providing global scale and further upstream integration.

In 2011, we transferred our Refining Business, our Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business and certain

infrastructure assets to three joint ventures outside the INEOS Group. Please see “Business—Refining Divestiture,
Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Refining Divestiture” for a further description of the disposal of
our Refining Business and Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business.

In 2013, we completed the Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our

indirect parent company. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Grangemouth Divestiture.”

In 2014, we divested the olefins and polymers assets and Chemical Intermediates assets of the Lavéra site. See

“Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Lavéra Divestiture.”

In 2015, we completed the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker at Rafnes,

Norway from the INOVYN group (formerly the Kerling Group), a related party. In 2015, we also acquired aromatics and
cumene assets from Axiall Corporation. The acquisition comprised the world’s largest cumene plant in Pasadena, Texas.
In addition, Axiall’s phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene business was transferred to the INEOS phenol facility at
Mobile, Alabama.

In 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one of the largest high density

polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America. Moreover, in 2016, following a strategic review of the
INEOS Technologies business, we decided to cease marketing its polyolefins licensing technology externally and to
transfer the remaining parts of the INEOS Technologies business to existing businesses within the Group to provide a
clearer focus on individual product lines.

In 2019, the Group acquired the INESCO combined heat and power plant at the Antwerp site in Belgium.

In December 2020, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE joint venture from

Sasol Chemicals. The principal activity of the company is the production of high density polyethylene in La Porte, Texas,
United States. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100% through Unrestricted Subsidiaires (as
defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement). Prior to the acquisition the Group reflected its
50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture. A Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement) of the Group is the operator of the facility and has the exclusive right to supply Gemini with the
required components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the HDPE products and to take such quantity
of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE
Term Loans.”

In December 2021, the Group acquired the assets of Charter Plastics in Titusville, United States, a manufacturer

of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe products.

In the summer of 2022, the Group began construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp, Belgium, for

the production of ethylene with a nameplate capacity of approximately 1,450 kta, along with associated utilities, tankage
and infrastructure (“Project ONE”). We believe Project ONE is the largest investment in the European chemicals
industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most environmentally-friendly of its kind. It is planned to
be equipped with the best available technologies with a high efficiency in use of raw materials and energy, CO2
emissions that are expected to be less than half of the currently best performing similar units in Europe from the outset
and a clear path to carbon neutrality on a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis within 10 years of start-up of the cracker. See also
“Risk Factors—Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or developments may prove difficult for
us to consummate,” “Risk Factors—Litigation—We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us,
and adverse results may harm our business” and “Business—Facilities—Project ONE.”

In August 2022, the Group agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui

Chemicals for approximately $330.0 million, which will add more than 1,000 kta of capacity, including for cumene,
phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A, upon completion (expected in the first quarter of 2023).

In December 2022, the Group acquired for approximately RMB 10.5 billion, through an Unrestricted

Subsidiary, a 50% interest in the Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited facility in Shanghai, China
(“SECCO”). The remaining 50% is owned by SINOPEC. SECCO has a capacity of 4,200 kta of petrochemicals,
including ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, polystyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, benzene and
toluene. The Group also agreed to acquire, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary, a 50% interest in a new petrochemical
complex being built in China, which is currently under construction by SINOPEC and is expected to be on-stream by the


-----

end of 2023 (the “Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project”). This complex also includes a new 500 kta HDPE (HighDensity Polyethylene) plant.

**_Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations_**

Our results of operations are driven by a combination of factors affecting the petrochemical and chemical

intermediate markets generally, including general economic conditions, prices of raw materials, global supply and
demand for our products and environmental legislation, including climate change initiatives. Our results of operations are
also impacted by company-specific structural and operational factors. Set forth below is an overview of the key drivers
that have affected the historical results of operations, and are expected to affect our future results of operations.

_Supply and Demand in the Petrochemical Industry_

Margins in the petrochemical industry are strongly influenced by industry utilization. As demand for

petrochemical products approaches available supply, utilization rates rise, and prices and margins typically increase.
Historically, this relationship has been highly cyclical due to fluctuations in supply resulting from the timing of new
investments in capacity and general economic conditions affecting the relative strength or weakness of demand.
Generally, capacity is more likely to be added in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and margins
are, or are expected to be, high. Investments in new capacity can result, and in the past frequently have resulted, in
overcapacity, which typically leads to a reduction of margins. In response, petrochemical producers typically reduce
capacity or limit further capacity additions, eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied.

After a sharp drop in operating rates as a result of demand destruction during the COVID-19 pandemic, and

excessive capacity addition in Asia, NexantECA’s analysis of the global supply and demand for ethylene indicates that
the rate of capacity addition will exceed consumption growth in the near term. Operating rates fell by three percentage
points to 87% in 2020, and remained flat at this level through 2021, as high capacity growth was matched by rebounding
consumption. NexantECA forecasts that capacity addition has peaked in 2022 and will slow significantly over 20232024. NexantECA also forecasts that global operating rates will decline further to 82% by 2023, although NexantECA
notes that the pressure on operating rates will be more severe in Asia where the capacity addition is concentrated, than in
Europe or the United States. Nevertheless, the rate of margin recovery in the petrochemical industry is highly dependent
on the actual speed of global macro-economic growth. In addition to the global petrochemical cycle, margins are also
susceptible to potentially significant swings in the short term. This volatility, which may be global or isolated in
individual regions, can be caused by a number of factors, including fluctuations in utilization rates due to planned or
unplanned plant outages, political and economic conditions driving rapid changes in prices for key feedstocks, exchange
rate fluctuations and changes in inventory management policies by petrochemical customers (such as inventory building
or de-stocking in periods of expected price increases).

_Asset Utilization_

Our results of operations are materially influenced by the degree to which we utilize our assets in order to

achieve maximum production volumes. As a low-cost producer, we believe in operating our facilities at full capacity. We
believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows, even during downturns in industry cycles or customer
demand, more readily than some of our competitors who have higher production costs. We intend to achieve growth in
production volume by improving utilization rates within the defined availability of an asset, improving availability of an
asset by minimizing planned and unplanned facility downtime and improving capacity of an asset through debottlenecking projects.

For example, the number and length of turnarounds (scheduled outages of a unit in order to perform necessary

inspections and testing to comply with industry regulations and to permit us to carry out any maintenance activities that
may be necessary) carried out in any given period can impact operating results.

When possible, we seek to schedule the timing of turnarounds to coincide with periods of relatively low demand

for the products of the relevant units. Olefins crackers typically undergo major turnarounds every four or five years, with
each turnaround lasting four to six weeks. Turnarounds for polymers and derivatives units are more frequent, typically
every one to two years, but generally last only seven to 10 days. Likewise, unplanned outages, such as the freezing
weather conditions in Texas during the latter part of the first quarter of 2021, the outages at our Green Lake and Seal
Sands sites in 2019, the impact of Hurricane Harvey in autumn 2017 and the power outage at the Rafnes, Norway site
resulting in a fire in October 2016, can impact our operating results, even if such outages are covered by insurance.
Similarly, planned or unplanned outages of our competitors can positively affect our operating results by decreasing the
supply of product in the market.

_Oil and Gas Price Movements_


-----

Feedstock costs are a significant component of the operating costs of our petrochemical business. The costs of

the feedstocks we require to make our petrochemical products (naphtha, ethane, butane and propane) are principally
driven by the price of oil and natural gas. According to the U.S. Energy Administration, the spot price for Brent crude oil
decreased from approximately $92 per barrel in January 2008 to approximately $74 per barrel in December 2021, while
the natural gas Citygate price in Texas decreased from $8.23 per thousand cubic feet in January 2008 to $7.11 per
thousand cubic feet in December 2021. During 2021 the crude oil price steadily increased reaching a high of
approximately $86 per barrel in October before finishing the year at approximately $74 per barrel as compared to
approximately $50 per barrel at the end of 2020. In the beginning of 2022 the crude oil price increased again, reaching a
high of approximately $123 per barrel in June before finishing at approximately $90 at September 30, 2022. The average
price of crude oil, and thus the price of petrochemical products, increased to an average of approximately $105 per barrel
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 ($71 for the year ended December 31, 2021) as compared to an
average of approximately $68 per barrel for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 ($42 for the year ended
December 31, 2020).

Our ability to pass on price increases for crude is limited due to the impact of time lags resulting from the

repricing intervals of our contracts with suppliers and customers, particularly in the petrochemical business. While most
of our feedstock contracts reprice daily, our contracts with customers generally reprice on a monthly basis. A further
limitation is that many of our customers take advantage of fluctuating prices by building inventories when they expect
product prices to increase and reducing inventories when they expect prices to decrease. The effect of these time lags and
our customers’ inventory management policies on our ability to pass through feedstock price increases is magnified in
periods of high volatility. In addition, changes in oil and gas prices have a direct impact on our working capital levels and
on inventory losses, especially in the event of a sudden decrease in oil and gas prices. While negatively affecting our
EBITDA before exceptionals, these inventory losses and cost of sales adjustments are non-cash in nature. In general,
increases in feedstock prices lead to an increase in our working capital and decreases in feedstock prices lead to a
decrease in our working capital.

_Implementation of Cost Reduction_

We have historically focused on implementing our strategies of reducing costs by making rapid reductions in

underlying fixed costs and implementing an efficient corporate and management structure and maximizing the utilization
of our assets. Our ability to continue to reduce costs will impact, among other things, our profitability and capacity plans.

_Debt Structure_

As of September 30, 2022, we had €8,078.7 million (including €575.5 million of debt under the Gemini HDPE

term loan facility) (December 31, 2021: €7,785.2 million (including €512.1 million under the Gemini HDPE term loan
facility)) of outstanding indebtedness. Our future results of operations, and in particular our net finance charges, will be
significantly affected by the amount of our outstanding indebtedness, including the interest we pay on our indebtedness.
The servicing of this indebtedness will impact, among other things, our cash flows and our cash balance.

In November 2021, the Group raised €1.1 billion of Senior Secured Term Loans which were used to fully

redeem the outstanding Senior Notes due 2024.

In December 2020, as part of the Group’s purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE plant in

Texas, United States, from Sasol Chemicals the Group amended and upsized the existing term loan facility within the
acquired legal entity, an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The amended loan facility was upsized to $600 million and the maturity
extended to October 31, 2027. A Restricted Subsidiary of the Group is the operator of the HDPE plant and has the
exclusive right to supply Gemini with the required components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the
HDPE products and to take such quantity of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description
of Other Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE Term Loans.”

In October 2020, the Group issued €325 million Senior Secured Notes due March 2026 and borrowed new euro

denominated Senior Secured Term Loans of €375 million which mature on October 27, 2027.

In June 2019, the Group entered into an inventory monetization agreement with J Aron & Company LLC (“J

**Aron”). Under this arrangement, the Group sold certain inventory to J Aron and agreed to buy back equivalent inventory**
at the end of the term at the same price. In April 2021, the Group and J Aron agreed an extension of the term to June
2022 and, in June 2022, another extension of one year to June 2023. A further extension option may be exercised by
mutual agreement.

In April 2019, the Group issued €770 million Senior Secured Notes due March 2026. The proceeds of the

refinancing were used to redeem in full the €770 million Senior Secured Notes due 2023 on May 1, 2019.


-----

_Foreign Exchange Rate Fluctuations_

Our results of operations may be affected by both the transaction effects and translation effects of foreign

currency exchange rate fluctuations. A substantial portion of our revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar and
euro. In our European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs are
denominated in euro and British pounds. In our U.S. petrochemical and chemical intermediates businesses, product
prices, raw material costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We generally do not enter into
foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, although we have done so in the past and
we may do so in the future. We also believe that we benefit from natural hedging to the extent that we have been able to
match the currencies of our cash flows and long-term indebtedness.

Our reporting currency is the euro, and our results of operations will be impacted by the relative strength of the

euro against other currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the British pound. In 2019, the value of the euro relative to
the U.S. dollar decreased and in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak continued to do so in the first half of 2020 before
increasing again during the second half of 2020 and throughout the first half of 2021, before decreasing again during the
second half of 2021 and the first nine months of 2022.

_Environmental Considerations_

Our results of operations are affected by environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to GHG

and other air emissions, and environmental risks and goals generally. We have invested, and will continue to invest, a
significant amount of financial and technical resources in order to achieve and maintain compliance with environmental
requirements. From time to time, we also incur remediation and decommissioning costs at our current and former
production facilities, as well as at other locations. Environmental considerations can also impact the markets in which we
operate, including our position with respect to our competitors.

_COVID-19_

Our results of operations were, and may in the future be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and susbsequent

variants of COVID-19. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global
pandemic and there is elevated concern globally about the impact that the COVID-19 crisis will have on the global
economy. While the Group produces a variety of chemicals which are used in the production of medical equipment,
including face masks, ventilators, gloves, eye visors and anti-bacterial hand gel, and are also widely used in food
packaging with respect to which demand has increased due to COVID-19, demand for durables such as for use in the
automotive and construction industry declined in 2020 before recovering in 2021.

For example, sales volumes were approximately 2% lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to

the same period in 2019 as the COVID-19 virus pandemic impacted demand across all regions, as numerous countries
entered lockdowns throughout 2020. The biggest decrease was in the Chemical Intermediates segment as volumes were
adversely impacted by lower market demand. The Group’s results were also adversely impacted by the sharp fall in raw
material costs which led to significant inventory holding losses during 2020. Nevertheless, demand for packaging,
medical, food and cleaning applications was strong, largely offsetting the automotive and construction downturn as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In early March 2020, the Group developed contingency plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, with the primary

objectives of maintaining the safety of personnel and the reliable operation of the Group’s plants. This resulted in a
number of changes to standard working practices and shift patterns to reduce personnel on site to those defined as
operationally critical in order to adhere to social distancing rules in line with local government advice.

Any safety critical activity was formally risk assessed to take cognizance of additional controls necessary to

protect core personnel from COVID-19, hence safeguarding safety critical work at all times. The Group implemented a
number of measures to conserve cash during 2020, including:

      - implementing policies to control all discretionary fixed costs and halting all non-essential recruitment;

      - reviewing all capital projects in each of the businesses and taking decisions to defer or reduce
discretionary expenditure where it was safe to do so, and delaying planned site maintenance
turnarounds where possible; and

      - applying for corporate tax refunds and deferrals where available.

Throughout the pandemic all of the Group’s plants continued to operate fully and supply chains operated

without significant disruption. Protecting employees and ensuring that they remained healthy was the first priority of the


-----

Group. All plants had sufficient resources and implemented measures to ensure that this remained the case throughout the
pandemic.

**Results of Operations**

The consolidated financial information of INEOS is prepared in accordance with IFRS. The income statement

data for the years ended December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 and the nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 represent the consolidated results of the Group.

**_Description of Key Line Items_**

Set forth below is a brief description of the composition of the key line items of our consolidated income

statement accounts:

      - _Revenue._ Group revenue represents the invoiced value of products sold or services provided to third
parties net of sales discounts and value-added taxes. It also excludes our share of joint venture revenue. The
pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and arrangements) or is linked by
a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional amount (formula contracts). Services
provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other chemical
companies with units on our sites, and services under tolling arrangements. Under tolling arrangements,
customers pay for or provide raw materials to be converted into a certain specified product, for which we
charge a toll fee.

      - _Cost of sales and cost of sales before exceptional items._ Cost of sales and cost of sales before exceptional
items include fixed and variable production costs. Such production costs typically include the costs of raw
materials, packaging, utilities, direct wages and salaries, repairs and maintenance, waste disposal and
effluent treatment, consumables, attributable depreciation charges and directly attributable overheads,
including wages and salaries, depreciation charges and overheads that are attributable to production. Fixed
costs included in the cost of sales are rent, depreciation, repairs and maintenance, while variable costs
include raw materials, packaging, consumables and wages and salaries.

      - _Exceptional impairment charge._ Exceptional impairment charge is an expense which, because of its size
or nature, is disclosed to give a proper understanding of the underlying results for the period. These
expenses are mainly related to the impairment of property, plant and equipment related to the termination of
work at a site in Belgium.

      - _Distribution costs._ Distribution costs typically include the costs of warehousing, carriage and freight,
together with sales and distribution wages and salaries and depreciation on property, plant and equipment
used for sales and distribution.

      - _Administrative expenses and administrative expenses before exceptional items._ Administrative expenses
and administrative expenses before exceptional items typically include indirect wages and salaries and
indirect overheads. Indirect overheads would include such items as insurance costs, legal and professional
fees and office supplies. Administrative expenses before exceptional items also include the depreciation of
property, plant and equipment not directly attributable to production or sales and distribution.

      - _Exceptional administrative gains/(expenses)._ Exceptional administrative gains/(expenses) are those
gains/(expenses) which, because of their size or nature, are disclosed to give a proper understanding of the
underlying results for the period. These gains/(expenses) are mainly related to closure and demolition costs,
business restructuring and the provision for severance payments.

      - _Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method._ Share of
profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method relates to the results from
the investment in associated undertakings and joint ventures. For the periods under review, this included the
Group’s share in the Refining Business JV through its shares in INEOS Investments. These shares were
sold to a related party in December 2022.

      - _Finance income._ Finance income includes interest receivable on funds invested, expected return on
defined benefit pension plan assets, net fair value gain on derivatives and net foreign exchange gains.

      - _Finance costs and finance costs before exceptional items._ Finance costs and finance costs before
exceptional items include interest payable, finance charges on finance leases, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, net fair value losses derivatives and foreign exchange losses.


-----

      - _Exceptional finance costs._ Exceptional finance costs are those costs which, because of their size or nature,
are disclosed to give a proper understanding of the underlying results for the period. These costs are mainly
related to call premia and the write-off of unamortized debt issue costs following modification or
redemption of debt.

ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €13,712.4 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in revenues was
driven by higher selling prices, increased sales volumes and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro. Selling
prices followed the increase in crude oil prices, which increased to an average of $105 per barrel for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $68 per barrel in the same period in 2021. Overall sales volumes for the
Group were approximately 4% higher in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same
period in 2021 with all businesses experiencing an increase in sales volumes apart from the Phenol and Nitriles
businesses. In addition, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 11% against the euro in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, has increased the reported euro revenues.

_Cost of sales._ Cost of sales increased by €3,392.9 million, or 30.8%, to €14,401.5 million in the nine-month

period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €11,008.6 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in cost of
sales was largely due to the increase in crude oil prices, resulting in higher feedstock prices across the Group in the ninemonth period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. Energy costs were also notably higher,
especially in Europe, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021.

_Gross profit. Gross profit decreased by €394.1 million, or 14.6%, to €2,309.7 million in the nine-month period_

ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €2,703.8 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease in profitability was
driven by lower inventory holdings gains and lower margins, partially offset by an increase in volumes. Overall sales
volumes for the Group were approximately 4% higher in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared
to the same period in 2021 with all businesses experiencing an increase in sales volumes apart from the Phenol and
Nitriles businesses. Inventory holding gains within the O&P segments were approximately €56 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to inventory holding gains of €290 million in the same period in 2021. In
O&P North America olefins, polyethylene and polypropylene all experienced a decrease in margins following higher
energy and feedstock costs along with lengthening domestic supplies, although this was partially offset by higher pipe
margins. In addition, export opportunities were reduced during the period due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, along
with improved industry supply. O&P Europe saw an increase in margins in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. This was offset, however, by higher fixed costs and the adverse impact of
a scheduled maintenance turnaround of the Rafnes cracker. The increase in fixed costs was a result of the start of the
ATEX pipeline in the Trading and Shipping business, along with the entry into service of two new VLEC vessels and


-----

their associated costs. The scheduled maintenance turnaround of the Rafnes cracker resulted in a change in product mix
which resulted in lower margin products from other sites replacing the lost volumes at the Rafnes site. Chemical
Intermediates experienced an increase in profitability in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to
the same period in 2021, as increased profitability in the Oxide and Oligomers businesses was only partially offset by a
decrease in the Phenol and Nitriles businesses. Partly offsetting the decrease in Group gross profitability was the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 11% against the euro in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, which increased the reported euro results.

_Distribution costs. Distribution costs decreased by €5.1 million, or 3.2%, to €153.3 million in the nine-month_

period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €158.4 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease in
distribution costs reflects lower export sales and improved logistical contracts which have reduced freight costs in certain
parts of Europe.

_Administrative expenses. Administrative expenses increased by €17.7 million, or 6.1%, to €307.5 million in the_

nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €289.8 million for the same period in 2021, mainly as a
result of higher research and development costs in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the
same period in 2021.

_Operating profit. Operating profit decreased by €406.7 million, or 18.0%, to €1,848.9 million in the nine-_

month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €2,255.6 million for the same period in 2021.

_Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method. Share of profit/(loss)_

of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method was a profit of €134.2 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to a loss of €19.6 million for the same period in 2021. The share of profit
of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method primarily reflected the Group’s share of the results of
the Refining joint venture with PetroChina as margins in the European refining market have strengthened in the ninemonth period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021.

_Profit on disposal of fixed assets. There was a profit on disposal of fixed assets of €0.3 million in the nine-_

month period ended September 30, 2021.

_Profit before net finance costs. Profit before net finance costs decreased by €253.2 million, or 11.3%, to_

€1,983.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €2,236.3 million for the same
period in 2021.

_Finance income. Finance income increased by €18.2 million, or 48.1%, to €56.0 million in the nine-month_

period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €37.8 million for the same period in 2021. The income in the ninemonth period ended September 30, 2022 primarily related to interest income from loans to related parties, including
INEOS Upstream, and interest received on increased cash balances held by the Group.

_Finance costs. Finance costs increased by €86.9 million, or 29.5%, to €381.7 million in the nine-month period_

ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €294.8 million for the same period in 2021. The increase in finance costs for
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 reflected an increase in net foreign exchange losses partly offset by an
increase in net fair value gains on derivatives. The increase in net foreign exchange losses was primarily associated with
short-term intra-group funding, which experienced an exchange movements loss of €309.1 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to an exchange movements loss of €145.1 million in the same period in
2021. In addition, there was a net fair value gain on derivatives of €159.3 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022, as compared to a gain of €73.8 million for the same period in 2021.

_Profit before tax. Profit before tax decreased by €321.9 million, or 16.3%, to €1,657.4 million in the nine-_

month period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to €1,979.3 million for the same period in 2021.

_Tax charge. Tax charge decreased by €54.8 million, or 17.0%, to €266.7 million in the nine-month period_

ended September 30, 2022, as compared to €321.5 million for the same period in 2021 primarily due to the decreased
profitability of the Group. After adjusting for the profit from the share of associates and joint ventures, the effective tax
rate of approximately 18% reflects the anticipated tax rate for the Group for the full year. The underlying effective tax
rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021 was approximately 16% after adjusting for the loss from the
share of associates and joint ventures, which reflected the anticipated tax rate for the full year for 2021. The higher
anticipated effective tax rate for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in
2021 reflected the increased level of profitability of the Group in countries with higher corporate tax rates.

_Profit for the period. Profit for the period decreased by €267.1 million, or 16.1% to €1,390.7 million in the_

nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to €1,657.8 million for the same period in 2021.

**_Business segments_**

The Group reports under three business segments: O&P North America, O&P Europe and Chemical

Intermediates.

The following table provides an overview of the historical revenue and EBITDA before exceptionals of each of

the business segments for the periods indicated:

**Nine-Month Period**

Chemical Intermediates .................................................................................................................... 838.3 814.3

**2,448.7** **2,802.3**

**_O&P North America_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the O&P North America segment increased by €522.6 million, or 13.0%, to €4,529.4_

million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to €4,006.8 million for the same period in
2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher prices and increased sales volumes in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The weighted average sales price for the whole business
was higher in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as a result of
higher olefin and pipe prices. Sales volumes were approximately 10% higher in the nine-month period ended September
30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, driven by higher polyethylene and pipe sales, partially offset by lower
olefins and polypropylene sales. The higher sales volumes were mainly due to increased volumes from the Gemini plant
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as unplanned downtime in 2021 adversely impacted volumes for the
nine-month period ended September 30, 2021. Higher pipe volumes were due to additional sales volumes from the
Charter Plastics business which was acquired on December 31, 2021. In addition, the sales volumes at the start of 2021
were adversely impacted by freezing weather conditions in Texas which caused significant regional market disruption.
The appreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 11% against the euro in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 has also increased the reported euro results.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P North America segment decreased by_

€204.8 million, or 16.6%, to €1,028.7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to
€1,233.5 million in the same period in 2021. The decrease in profitability in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was largely due to lower margins and the adverse impact of inventory
holding losses. Olefins, polyethylene and polypropylene all experienced a decrease in margins following higher energy
and feedstock costs along with lengthening domestic supplies, although this was partially offset by higher pipe margins.
In addition, export opportunities were reduced during the period due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, along with
improved industry supply. Inventory holding losses were approximately €16 million in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022, as compared to inventory holding gains of approximately €132 million in the same period in 2021.
The decrease in profitability was partly offset by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 11% against the
euro in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 which has increased
the reported euro results.

**_O&P Europe_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the O&P Europe segment increased by €2,007.6 million, or 36.8%, to €7,459.7 million in_

the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €5,452.1 million for the same period in 2021. The
increase in revenues was driven primarily by higher selling prices and increased sales volumes in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The increase in selling prices was driven by the
general price environment, which was higher in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the
same period in 2021, as crude oil prices rose to an average of $105 per barrel for the nine-month period ended September


-----

30, 2022 as compared to an average of $68 per barrel for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021. As a result,
all prices increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. Total
sales volumes were approximately 13% higher in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the
same period in 2021. The Trading and Shipping business experienced higher sales volumes in the nine-month period
ended September 30 as compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher ethane and butane sales. Olefin
sales volumes were slightly lower in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in
2021 due to weakening markets with lower demand caused by inflation as a result of the high energy prices. Polymer
sales volumes decreased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due
to reduced demand and increased level of imports as compared to the same period in 2021.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P Europe segment decreased by €172.8_

million, or 22.9%, to €581.7 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to €754.5 million
in the same period in 2021. The results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 decreased compared to the
same period in 2021, primarily due to lower inventory holding gains, higher fixed costs and the impact on product mix.
Inventory holding gains were approximately €72 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as
compared to gains of approximately €158 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021. Fixed costs rose
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, mainly as a result of the
start of the ATEX pipeline in the Trading and Shipping business, along with the entry into service of two new VLEC
ships and their associated costs. The product mix effect mainly arose as a result of the scheduled turnaround maintenance
of the Rafnes cracker during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022. Whilst the reduction in volumes due to
the turnaround was largely offset by higher volumes at other sites, these offsetting volumes were in lower margin
products than those produced at the Rafnes site.

**_Chemical Intermediates_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the Chemical Intermediates segment increased by €1,687.1 million, or 27.1%, to_

€7,920.2 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €6,233.1 million for the same
period in 2021. The Oxide business revenues increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared
to the same period in 2021 driven by higher prices and increased sales volumes. The increase in pricing was driven by
rising raw material and natural gas prices which were mainly passed on to customers through the formula based pricing
of most products. Sales volumes increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same
period in 2021, as much of 2022 experienced strong European demand as competitor logistical supply issues limited
European imports, which had a favorable impact on European supply demand balance. The Oligomers business revenues
were higher in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of
higher prices and increased sales volumes. Regional prices in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 moved in
line with the underlying raw material prices of ethylene and naphtha. Regional feedstock prices were higher in the ninemonth period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 with higher European and U.S. ethylene
prices impacting PAO and LAO prices, whilst increased naphtha prices impacted PIB and SO pricing. Sales volumes
were higher in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as higher LAO
sales volumes were only partially offset by lower PAO, PIB and SO sales volumes. The increase in LAO sales volumes
was primarily seen in the North American and Asian markets and included good co-monomer demand with the business
benefitting from additional production volumes from the new LAO facility in Chocolate Bayou, United States. SO sales
were lower primarily due to softer demand in the European markets and PAO sales volumes decreased due to a number
of issues at several customers. Nitriles revenues increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as
compared to the same period in 2021, driven by higher prices, partly offset by lower volumes. The average acrylonitrile
sales price increased by over 20% in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in
2021, driven by higher ammonia pricing as a result of higher natural gas prices. Acrylonitrile sales volumes decreased in
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due to lower demand as a
result of high European and North American cost positions. The Phenol business revenues increased in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, driven primarily by higher prices, partly offset
by lower sales volumes. Selling prices moved in line with the underlying raw material prices with acetone and phenol
prices moving significantly higher due to increases in propylene and benzene feedstock prices. Sales volumes were lower
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 as a result of lower phenol,
acetone and cumene sales as lower market demand led to lower volumes, predominately in the European market.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the Chemical Intermediates segment increased_

by €24.0 million, or 2.9%, to €838.3 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to €814.3
million for the same period in 2021. The Oxide business results in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 were
higher compared to the same period in 2021, due to an increase in product margins and higher volumes. The increase in
margins in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 was driven by the
increase in underlying raw material costs being passed through at higher rates than the standard market pricing formulas
in the first half of 2022 before higher energy costs started to put some pressure on margins. Sales volumes increased in
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, driven by strong European


-----

demand as competitor logistical supply issues limited European imports, which had a favorable impact on European
market balances. The Oligomers business profitability increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as
compared with the same period in 2021, primarily due to higher margins and increased sales volumes. Margins were
higher across all product lines except PIB in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared with the
same period in 2021 due to higher overall realizations being increased above higher raw material and energy costs. The
biggest increase in margins was in the North American region, followed by Europe and then Asia. The business also
benefitted from higher LAO sales volumes following good co-monomer demand and the additional production volumes
from the new LAO facility in Chocolate Bayou, United States. The Nitriles business experienced a decrease in
profitability in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, driven by
lower volumes, partly offset by higher margins. Acrylonitrile sales volumes decreased in the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due to lower demand as a result of high European and North
American cost positions. Acrylonitrile margins benefited from high feedstock indices in the pricing formulas as well as
higher co-product credits whilst ammonia margins increased significantly in the nine-month period ended September 30,
2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The Phenol business profitability decreased in the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021, largely due to a decrease in volumes and to a lesser
extent lower margins. Volumes were lower due to reduced market demand for phenol, acetone and cumene, particularly
in the European market. Margins were lower in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the
same period in 2021, largely due to the adverse impact of higher energy and emission costs margins in the European
market, although this was partially offset by the higher benzene price levels. Global acetone margins were also weaker in
the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 due to rising propylene prices
during the period.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2020_**

**_Consolidated Results_**

_Revenue. Revenue increased by €7,523.0 million, or 66.6%, to €18,826.7 million for the year ended December_

31, 2021 as compared to €11,303.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in revenues was driven


-----

primarily by higher prices and increased sales volumes. The increase in selling prices followed the significant rise in
crude oil prices, which increased to an average of $71 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to
$42 per barrel in the same period in 2020. The largest price increases were in the O&P businesses which experienced
higher prices across all product lines reflecting healthy demand and tight markets as economies began to recovery from
the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall sales volumes for the Group were approximately 9% higher in the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 with the O&P and Phenol businesses
experiencing the biggest increase from resurgent economies, after 2020 volumes were adversely impacted by the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Cost of sales before exceptional items._ Cost of sales before exceptional items increased by €5,436.2 million, or

54.8%, to €15,357.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €9,921.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. The increase in cost of sales was largely due to the increase in crude oil prices in 2021, resulting in
higher feedstock prices across the Group as well as increased volumes in the year ended December 31, 2021, as
compared to the same period in 2020.

_Exceptional impairment charge._ Exceptional impairment charges of €118.5 million were charged for the

year ended December 31, 2020 in relation to certain plant and equipment following the Group’s decision to
terminate work on a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated infrastructure at its site in Antwerp, Belgium.

_Gross profit. Gross profit increased by €2,205.3 million, or 174.5%, to €3,469.0 million for the year ended_

December 31, 2021 as compared to €1,263.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in profitability
was driven by higher margins, increased sales volumes and inventory holding gains. Sales volumes were approximately
9% higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 as the Group experienced
higher volumes driven by tighter markets from a combination of stronger demand from resurgent economies and industry
supply constraints. This also led to an increase in margins across all businesses within the Group due to the favorable
market conditions during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. O&P North
America experienced higher margins across all product lines in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the
same period in 2020, particularly polyethylene and polypropylene, due to a combination of strong demand from a
resurgent U.S. economy and industry supply constraints, whilst olefin margins benefitted from a tighter market. Overall
margins in O&P Europe increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020
following higher olefin margins due to a stronger market, with demand for butadiene and benzene being particularly
strong as compared to the unfavorable market conditions in 2020. The polymers business experienced an increase in
margins due to logistical challenges in the market which reduced the level of European imports, coupled with strong U.S.
and European demand in both the durables and consumables markets. Inventory holding gains within the O&P segments
were approximately €279 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to inventory holding losses of €43
million in the same period in 2021, reflecting the increased raw material costs during 2021. Chemical Intermediates
experienced an increase in profitability across all businesses in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the
same period in 2020 with the Oxide business experiencing record margins. This was driven by commodity products
within the Oxide business, with both glycol margins and volumes increasing due to lower European imports, competitor
outages and strong European and Asian demand. Partially offsetting the increase in profitability across the Group was the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 5% against the euro in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared
to the same period in 2020 which decreased the reported euro results.

_Distribution costs. Distribution costs increased by €7.7 million, or 3.7%, to €215.1 million for the year ended_

December 31, 2021 as compared to €207.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in distribution
costs in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 reflected the higher sales volumes
across the Group in 2021, partially offset by the depreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 5% against the euro in
the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 which decreased the reported euro costs.

_Administrative expenses before exceptional items. Administrative expenses before exceptional items increased_

by €10.9 million, or 2.8%, to €398.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €387.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee
performance bonus accruals (including long term incentive plans) following a stronger than budgeted performance across
all businesses within the Group in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Exceptional administrative gains/(expenses). An exceptional administrative gain of €8.9 million was credited_

in the year ended December 31, 2021, which related to the final true-up of the original closure cost provision made in
December 2019 in respect of the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, UK following lower than expected demolition costs.
Exceptional administrative expenses of €8.9 million were charged for the year ended December 31, 2020, which related
to a provision for early retirement costs as part of a restructuring of the Köln site within the O&P Europe business.

_Operating profit. Operating profit increased by €2,204.5 million, or 334.1%, to €2,864.4 million for the year_

ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €659.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.


-----

_Share of (loss)/profit of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method. Share of (loss)/profit_

of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method was a loss of €42.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to €210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The share of loss of associates
and joint ventures using the equity accounting method primarily reflected the Group’s share of the results of the Refining
joint venture with PetroChina as margins in the European refining market have remained weak during 2021. In 2020
refining volumes were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 virus pandemic which reduced demand for many refined
products. In addition falling crude oil prices during 2020 resulted in significant inventory holding losses for the year
ended December 31, 2020.

_Profit on disposal of investments. Profit on disposal of investments for the year ended December 31, 2020 was_

€78.3 million and related to the disposal of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the Gemini HDPE joint venture
following the Group’s acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture from Sasol on December 31, 2020.

_Profit on disposal of fixed assets. Profit on disposal of fixed assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 was_

€0.3 million as compared to €1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Profit before net finance costs. Profit before net finance costs increased by €2,292.9 million, or 433.2%, to_

€2,822.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €529.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2020.

_Finance income. Total finance income decreased by €70.1 million, or 22.0%, to €248.2 million for the year_

ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €318.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in finance
income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily reflected a decrease in foreign exchange
gains and interest income on cash balances and other loan receivables, partly offset by an increase in net fair value gains
on derivatives. The decrease in net foreign exchange gains primarily associated with short-term intra-group funding was
an exchange movements gain of €121.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to an exchange
movements gain of €250.2 million for the same period in 2020. This was partly offset by a net fair value gain on
derivatives of €76.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a net fair value gain of €5.8
million for the same period in 2020.

_Finance costs before exceptional items. Finance costs before exceptional items increased by €228.8 million, or_

77.2%, to €525.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €296.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020. The increase in finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflected an increase
in foreign exchange losses primarily associated with short-term intra-group funding which was a loss of €234.4 million in
the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to a loss of €21.8 million for the same period in 2020. There were also
additional interest and amortisation of issue costs on the Senior Secured Term Loans and Senior Secured Notes due
March 2026 issued in October 2020.

_Exceptional finance costs. Exceptional finance costs of €3.5 million were charged for the year ended_

December 31, 2021 following the write-off of deferred issue costs as a result of the early redemption of the Senior Notes
due 2024 in November 2021.

_Profit before tax. Profit before tax increased by €1,990.5 million, or 361.0%, to €2,541.9 million for the year_

ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €551.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

_Tax (charge)/credit. Tax charge increased by €474.4 million, to a charge of €449.6 million for the year ended_

December 31, 2021 as compared to a credit of €24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the
increased profitability of the Group. In 2020, the Group recognized tax refunds due in the United States in accordance
with the recently enacted CARES Act. This Act allowed the Group to carry back net operating losses in the United States
for a period of up to five years to obtain retroactive tax refunds at the tax rates applicable for the years the losses are
utilized. Net operating losses were created in the United States by the application of 100% tax depreciation on significant
capital expenditure projects that were placed into service in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The effective
tax rate for the Group for the year ended December 31, 2021 was lower than the standard rate in Luxembourg of 24.94%,
as profits were made in regions with lower rates (such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland) which more than offset
profits made in regions with higher rates than the standard rate (such as Germany and Belgium).

_Profit for the year. Profit for the year increased by €1,516.1 million, or 263.1%, to €2,092.3 million for the_

year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €576.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Business Segments_**

The Group reports under three business segments: O&P North America, O&P Europe and Chemical

Intermediates.

Chemical Intermediates ................................................................................................................ 1,090.8 585.5

**3,616.2** **1,535.0**

**_O&P North America_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the O&P North America segment increased by €2,742.3 million, or 98.5%, to €5,527.3_

million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to €2,785.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The increase was driven by higher prices and higher volumes in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2020. The weighted average sales price for the whole business was higher in the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, as the olefins, polymers and pipe businesses all experienced
a rise in prices during 2021. Sales volumes increased by approximately 11% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to the same period in 2020 driven by higher sales volumes within the olefins, polymers and pipe businesses.
The increase in the olefin volumes was driven by the debottleneck project at the Chocolate Bayou, United States site and
additional feedstock sales. The increase in additional polyethylene volumes was mainly due to the acquisition of the
remaining 50% interest in the HDPE plant at the Battleground site in Texas, United States on December 31, 2020.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P North America segment increased by_

€1,023.0 million, or 184.6%, to €1,577.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €554.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020 was driven by higher margins and volumes. Margins were higher across all product lines in the year
ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, particularly polyethylene and polypropylene, due to a
combination of strong demand from a resurgent U.S. economy and industry supply constraints, whilst olefin margins
benefitted from a tighter market. Total sales volumes increased approximately 11% in the year ended December 31, 2021
as compared to the same period in 2020 driven by higher sales volumes within the olefins, polymers and pipe businesses.
Inventory holding gains were €75 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to inventory holding gains
of €54 million in the same period in 2020. Partially offsetting the increase in EBITDA before exceptionals was the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar by approximately 5% against the euro in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared
to the same period in 2020 which decreased the reported euro results.

**_O&P Europe_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the O&P Europe segment increased by €2,867.7 million, or 61.6%, to €7,526.0 million_

for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €4,658.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The
increase in revenues was driven by higher selling prices and increased sales volumes in the year ended December 31,
2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in selling prices was driven by the general price
environment, which was higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, as crude
oil prices increased to an average of $71 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to an average of
$42 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020, which in turn led to an increase in prices across all product lines.
The naphtha price increased continuously throughout 2021, averaging 71% higher than in 2020. Feedstock, such as
butane and propane also rose by 90% and 85% respectively in 2021 as compared to 2020. Sales prices also saw strong
increases reflecting the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, healthy demand and tight markets. Sales
volumes increased by approximately 10% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020
driven by higher olefin and polypropylene volumes which reflected the market recovery in 2021, as 2020 was adversely
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P Europe segment increased by €552.9_

million, or 139.9%, to €948.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to €395.3 million for the year


-----

ended December 31, 2020. The results for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020 due to higher margins, increased volumes and higher inventory holding gains. Sales volumes
increased by approximately 10% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 driven by
higher olefin and polypropylene volumes. Inventory holding gains were €204 million in the year ended December 31,
2021 as compared to losses of €97 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The inventory holding gains were
driven by the increase in feedstock prices, particularly naphtha, butane and propane which all experienced significant
increases during the year ended December 31, 2021. Overall margins increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 following
higher olefin margins due to a stronger market, with demand for butadiene and benzene being particularly strong as
compared to the unfavorable market conditions in 2020. The polymers business experienced an increase in margins due
to logistical challenges in the market which reduced the level of European imports, coupled with strong U.S. and
European demand in both the durables and consumables markets. The Trading & Shipping business experienced lower
margins in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 as higher freight costs adversely
impacted profitability.

**_Chemical Intermediates_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the Chemical Intermediates segment increased by €3,143.3 million, or 58.7%, to_

€8,496.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €5,352.9 million for the year ended December
31, 2020. The Oxide business revenues increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020 driven by higher prices and increased sales volumes. Overall prices increased in the year ended
December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, as pricing closely followed the rise in underlying raw
material costs of ethylene and propylene, with high demand and limited supply also contributing to rising prices. Sales
volumes were approximately 8% higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020,
most notably in the commodity area where ethylene and propylene glycols performed much stronger due to the absence
of U.S. imports as a result of the extreme weather seen in Texas in early 2021, outages at some competitors and improved
demand due to the resurgence of the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oligomers business revenues were
higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of higher
prices and increased sales volumes. Regional prices ordinarily move in line with the underlying raw material prices of
ethylene and naphtha. Regional feedstock prices were higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the
same period in 2020 with higher European and U.S. ethylene prices and increased naphtha prices impacting selling
prices. Sales volumes were approximately 5% higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2020 as LAO, PAO and SO all experienced higher sales volumes. The increase in sales volumes
were primarily due to strong demand across most customer industries as economies began to open up again from the
COVID-19-related disruptions experienced during 2020. LAO volumes also benefitted from additional production from
the new LAO plant at Chocolate Bayou, United States which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2021. Nitriles
revenues increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by
higher prices. The average acrylonitrile sales price increased by 75% in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared
to the same period in 2020, driven by higher propylene prices and the U.S. market predominately being cost plus pricing.
Excluding the impact of the closure of the Seal Sands, UK plant in December 2020, the sales volumes of acrylonitrile for
the year ended December 31, 2021 was in line with the volumes achieved in 2020 despite limited product availability
from unplanned outages at Green Lake and a force majeure declaration in Köln during 2021. The Phenol business
revenues increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven
primarily by higher prices and increased volumes. Selling prices moved in line with the underlying raw material prices
with acetone and phenol prices moving significantly higher due to historically high U.S. and European propylene and
benzene feedstock prices as well as a tighter market in 2021. Sales volumes were approximately 11% higher in the year
ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of higher phenol and acetone
sales. The increased volumes were driven by much improved European demand in the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to the same period in 2020.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the Chemical Intermediates segment increased_

by €505.3 million, or 86.3%, to €1,090.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to €585.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Oxide business results for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly driven by record margins and increased volumes. The increase in
margins in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 was driven by commodity
products with glycol margins and volumes both increasing due to lower U.S. imports related to the aftereffects of the
earlier freezing weather conditions in Texas at the start of 2021, competitor outages and strong European and Asian
demand. EO and EO derivatives also experienced increased margins due to improved European demand from a resurgent
economy. The Oligomers business profitability increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year
ended December 31, 2020, as a result of increased sales volumes and higher margins. Sales volumes were approximately
5% higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as LAO, PAO and
SO all experienced higher sales volumes primarily due to strong demand across most customer industries as economies
began to open up again from COVID-19-related disruptions. Overall margins were higher in the year ended December
31, 2021 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2020 which was driven by higher LAO margins in North


-----

America and Asia. The increase in overall margins was partly offset by lower PAO and SO margins which were
adversely impacted by higher production and conversion costs. The Nitriles business experienced an increase in
profitability in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to higher
margins and lower fixed costs. Margins were higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2020 due to stronger market conditions, as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continued throughout
2021 with average acrylonitrile margins increasing by 39% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2020. Fixed costs were lower in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the same
period in 2020 mainly due to the cost savings from the closure of the Seal Sands, UK plant in December 2020. The
Phenol business profitability increased in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December
31, 2020, primarily due to higher margins and increased volumes. Volumes were higher in the year ended December 31,
2021 as compared to the same period in 2020, driven by higher phenol and acetone volumes following significantly
improved European demand during 2021. Margins were higher in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the
same period in 2020, driven by higher European and U.S. benzene prices and increased phenol adders in 2021, partly
offset by weaker acetone margins.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared With Year Ended December 31, 2019_**

**_Consolidated Results_**

_Revenue. Revenue decreased by €2,401.3 million, or 17.5%, to €11,303.7 million for the year ended December_

31, 2020 as compared to €13,705.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in revenues was driven
primarily by lower prices and to a lesser extent lower volumes. The decrease in selling prices followed the significant fall
in crude oil prices, which decreased to an average of $42 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared
to $64 per barrel in the same period in 2019. The largest decrease was in the O&P Europe business as prices were
adversely impacted by lower market demand, especially in butadiene and benzene. Sales volumes were approximately
2% lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 as the COVID-19 virus
pandemic impacted demand across all regions, as numerous countries entered lockdowns throughout 2020. Nevertheless,
demand for packaging, medical, food and cleaning applications was strong, largely offsetting the automotive and
construction downturn as a result of the pandemic.

_Cost of sales before exceptional items._ Cost of sales before exceptional items decreased by €1,852.9 million, or

15.7%, to €9,921.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €11,774.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of sales was largely due to the decrease in crude oil prices, which has meant
lower feedstock prices across the Group in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.

_Exceptional impairment charge. Exceptional impairment charges of €118.5 million were charged for the year_

ended December 31, 2020 in relation to certain plant and equipment following the Group’s decision to terminate work on
a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated infrastructure at its site in Antwerp, Belgium.

_Gross profit. Gross profit decreased by €666.9 million, or 34.5%, to €1,263.7 million for the year ended_

December 31, 2020 as compared to €1,930.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in profitability
was primarily driven by lower margins and to a lesser extent lower volumes. Sales volumes were approximately 2%
lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, as the COVID-19 virus pandemic
impacted demand as many countries entered lockdowns during 2020. In addition, there were scheduled major
turnarounds of one of the Chocolate Bayou crackers and one of the Köln crackers during 2020, which adversely impacted
results in the year. O&P North America polymer margins were lower during 2020 as compared to 2019, driven by
decreased polyethylene and polypropylene margins, largely as a result of weaker demand due to COVID-19 disruption
and additional polypropylene capacity coming online. In addition, the pipe business experienced lower margins in the
year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, due to more industry capacity coming online and
weaker demand in the oil and gas market. The O&P Europe business experienced lower olefin margins in the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted
olefin demand and decreased margins. O&P Europe polymer margins were also lower during 2020, although the business
benefitted from strong demand from the consumables sector, specifically healthcare and food packaging consumables
which boosted sales volumes and helped minimize the impact on margins from the slowdown in the durables sector as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Polymers also benefitted from strong demand in China which helped export sales as
Europe remained globally competitive. The O&P Europe business also benefitted from the start-up of the new Mariner
East 2 LPG pipeline and supply chain and the commencement of a new ethane supply contract within its Trading &
Shipping business. Overall inventory holding losses for the O&P businesses were approximately €43 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020, as compared to inventory holding losses of approximately €56 million in the same period in
2019. Chemical Intermediates also experienced a decrease in profitability in the year ended December 31, 2020 as
compared to the same period in 2019 driven by lower margins across most businesses and lower sales volumes in certain
businesses due to COVID-19-related market weakness impacting demand.


-----

_Distribution costs. Distribution costs decreased by €22.3 million, or 9.7%, to €207.4 million for the year ended_

December 31, 2020 as compared to €229.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The fall in distribution costs in
the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 reflected the lower sales volumes in the year
within the Group.

_Administrative expenses before exceptional items. Administrative expenses before exceptional items decreased_

by €53.5 million, or 12.1%, to €387.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €441.0 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in administrative expenses was primarily due to lower employee
performance bonus accruals (including long-term incentive plans) following a weaker than budgeted performance across
all the businesses within the Group in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2019, together with a focus on reduced fixed costs in response to the COVID 19 pandemic during 2020.

_Exceptional administrative gains/(expenses). Exceptional administrative expenses of €8.9 million were_

charged for the year ended December 31, 2020, which related to a provision for early retirement costs as part of a
restructuring of the Köln site within the O&P Europe business. Exceptional administrative expenses of €48.1 million
were charged for the year ended December 31, 2019, which related to €35.1 million in respect for closure costs including
severance and outplacement expenses, together with decommissioning and demolition costs following the Group’s
decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United Kingdom in December 2019. There was also a €13.0 million
settlement of an intellectual property dispute in respect of the former Technologies business.

_Operating profit. Operating profit decreased by €551.9 million, or 45.5%, to €659.9 million for the year ended_

December 31, 2020 as compared to €1,211.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Share of profit/(loss) of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method. Share of profit/(loss)_

of associates and joint ventures using the equity accounting method was a loss of €210.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared to a profit of €67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The share of loss
from associates and jointly controlled entities primarily reflected the Group’s share of the results of the Refining joint
venture with PetroChina. Refining volumes were adversely impacted by the COVID 19 virus pandemic in the year ended
December 31, 2020, which reduced demand for many refined products. Margins in the European refining market have
weakened in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, driven by reduced demand and
falling crude oil prices, which have resulted in significant inventory holding losses in the year.

_Profit on disposal of investments. Profit on disposal of investments for the year ended December 31, 2020 was_

€78.3 million and related to the disposal of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the Gemini HDPE joint venture
following the Group’s acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture from Sasol. Profit on disposal of
investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 was €2.6 million and related to the repayment of the Group’s
preferential interest in INEOS Investments Partnership following the sale by INEOS Investments Partnership of its assets
(shares in PQ Corporation) to INEOS Limited, a related party, for $296.5 million (€260.5 million).

_Profit on disposal of fixed assets. Profit on disposal of fixed assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 was_

€1.1 million.

_Profit before finance costs. Profit before finance costs decreased by €752.1 million, or 58.7%, to €529.3_

million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €1,281.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Finance income. Finance income increased by €227.3 million, or 249.8%, to €318.3 million for the year ended_

December 31, 2020 as compared to €91.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in finance income
for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected an increase in net foreign exchange gains,
partly offset by a reduction in interest income on cash balances and other loan receivables. The increase in net foreign
exchange gains primarily associated with short term intra group funding was an exchange movements gain of €250.2
million in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to an exchangement movements gain of €6.8 million for the
same period in 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020 there was also a net fair value gain on derivatives of €5.8
million.

_Finance costs before exceptional items. Finance costs before exceptional items decreased by €124.9 million, or_

29.7%, to €296.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €421.1 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The decrease in finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected a
combination of a decrease in net fair value losses on derivatives and a reduction in variable interest rates on the dollardenominated Term Loans in the year.

_Exceptional finance costs. Exceptional finance costs of €11.7 million were charged for the year ended_

December 31, 2019 as a result of the early redemption of the 2023 Senior Secured Notes, which included an early


-----

prepayment premium of €7.7 million and the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with the redeemed Notes of €4.0
million.

_Profit before tax. Profit before tax decreased by €388.2 million, or 41.3%, to €551.4 million for the year ended_

December 31, 2020 as compared to €939.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Tax (charge)/credit. Tax (charge)/credit changed by €241.1 million, or 111.5%, to a credit of €24.8 million for_

the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a charge of €216.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The
decrease in the tax charge was primarily due to the decreased profitability of the Group, together with the recognition of
specific tax refunds available in the US. The Group recognized tax refunds due in the U.S. in accordance with the
CARES Act enacted in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. This Act allows the Group to carry back available net
operating losses in the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 for a period of up to five years to obtain
retroactive tax refunds at the tax rates applicable for the years the losses are utilized. Net operating losses were created in
the U.S. by the application of 100% tax depreciation on significant capital expenditure projects that were placed into
service in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The effective tax rate for the Group for the year ended
December 31, 2019 was lower than the standard rate in Luxembourg of 24.94% as profits were made in regions with
lower rates (such as UK and Switzerland) which more than offset profits made in regions with higher rates than the
standard rate (such as Germany and Belgium).

_Profit for the year. Profit for the year decreased by €147.1 million, or 20.3%, to €576.2 million for the year_

ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €723.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

**_Business Segments_**

The Group reports under three business segments: O&P North America, O&P Europe and Chemical

Intermediates.

The following table provides an overview of the historical revenue and EBITDA before exceptionals of each of

the business segments for the periods indicated:

**1,535.0** **1,945.1**

**_O&P North America_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the O&P North America segment decreased by €415.8 million, or 13.0%, to €2,785.0_

million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to €3,200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.
The decrease was primarily driven by lower prices and to a lesser extent lower volumes in the year ended December 31,
2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The weighted average sales price for the whole business was
lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, as the polymers and pipe businesses
all experienced a fall in prices whilst olefin prices remained relatively flat. Sales volumes were only marginally lower in
the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, largely due to lower polyethylene volumes
being offset by higher olefin and polypropylene volumes. The pipe business experienced lower sales volumes in the year
ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, largely as a result of more industry capacity coming
online and a weaker oil and gas market in 2020.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P North America segment decreased by_

€172.6 million, or 23.7%, to €554.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €726.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019. The fall in profitability in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year


-----

ended December 31, 2019 was largely due to lower margins partially offset by inventory holding gains. In addition, there
was a scheduled major turnaround of one of the Chocolate Bayou crackers during 2020, which adversely impacted results
in the year. Overall margins were lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 as
polymer margins were lower, driven by decreased polyethylene and polypropylene margins, largely as a result of weaker
demand due to COVID-19 disruption and additional polypropylene capacity coming online. The pipe business
experienced lower margins in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, due to more
industry capacity coming online and weaker demand in the oil and gas market. Total sales volumes decreased marginally
in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, largely driven by lower polyethylene
volumes, partially offset by higher olefin and polypropylene volumes. Inventory holding gains were approximately €54
million in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to inventory holding losses of approximately €43 million in
the same period in 2019.

**_O&P Europe_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the O&P Europe segment decreased by €1,203.6 million, or 20.5%, to €4,658.3 million_

for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €5,861.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The
decrease in revenues was driven by lower selling prices partially offset by higher polymer and Trading & Shipping sales
volumes in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in
selling prices was driven by the general price environment, which was lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as
compared to the same period in 2019, as crude oil prices fell to an average of $42 per barrel for the year ended December
31, 2020 as compared to an average of $64 per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2019, which in turn led to a fall in
prices across most product lines. Butadiene prices experienced the most significant price decrease compared to the same
period in 2019, due to a considerably weaker automotive market. Other olefin products also experienced a price reduction
compared to the same period in 2019, generally as a result of oversupply and weaker demand. The polymers business
also experienced price reductions in the year, especially in the automotive and construction markets. The fall in these
markets was partially offset by continued high demand for medical and food packaging consumables as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The business experienced higher Trading & Shipping sales volumes in the year ended December
31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to the start-up of the Mariner East 2 LPG pipeline and
supply chain, and the commencement of a new ethane supply contract. In addition, the polymers business experienced
higher sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 as there was strong
demand in the medical and food packaging consumables sectors, together with the construction and piping sectors
rebounding in the last quarter of 2020 following the adverse impact on demand of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier in the
year. Strong demand in China also helped export sales as Europe remained globally competitive, which helped offset
some of the weaker European demand. Olefin sales volumes were lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as
compared to same period in 2019 due to reduced demand particularly in the automotive industry and the adverse impact
on volumes of a scheduled major turnaround of one of the Köln crackers during the year.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the O&P Europe segment decreased by €196.1_

million or 33.2% to €395.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to €591.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019. The results for the year ended December 31, 2020 have decreased compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019, due to lower margins and higher inventory holding losses which were only partially offset by higher
polymer and Trading & Shipping sales volumes. Inventory holding losses were approximately €97 million in the year
ended December 31, 2020 as compared to losses of approximately €13 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Higher inventory holding losses were driven by the reduction in feedstock prices, particularly naphtha, in the year.
Olefins margins were also lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the same period in 2019 as a
result of reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted olefin volumes and reduced margins. There
was also a scheduled major turnaround of one of the Köln crackers in the year ended December 31, 2020, which
adversely impacted results for the year. Polymer margins were also lower during 2020, although the business benefitted
from strong demand from the consumables sector, specifically healthcare and food packaging consumables, which
boosted sales volumes and helped minimize the impact on margins from the slowdown in the durables sector as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Polymers also benefitted from strong demand in China which helped European export sales.
The Trading & Shipping business experienced lower margins in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the
same period in 2019 due to adverse market conditions, although this was offset by higher sales volumes due to the startup of the Mariner East 2 LPG pipeline and supply chain operations and the commencement of a new ethane supply
contract during 2020.

**_Chemical Intermediates_**

_Revenue. Revenue in the Chemical Intermediates segment decreased by €1,133.9 million, or 17.5%, to_

€5,352.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €6,486.8 million for the year ended December
31, 2019. The Oxide business revenues decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2019 driven by lower prices, partially offset by higher volumes. Overall prices decreased in the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, as pricing closely followed the sharp fall in underlying raw


-----

material costs of ethylene and propylene in the second quarter of 2020, which did not fully recover by the end of year.
Alkox products also experienced a fall in prices in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in
2019, driven by weaker demand due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 on demand throughout most of 2020. Sales
volumes experienced a small increase in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, as
the adverse impact of COVID-19 on commodity product volumes was offset by an increase of specialised products in the
cleaning and surfactant sectors. The Oligomers business revenues were lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of both lower sales volumes and lower prices. Sales volumes
were approximately 4% lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 as most
products experienced a decline. The lower sales volumes were the result of the COVID-19 pandemic with PAO and SO
products experiencing the biggest decreases, whilst LAO was only marginally down on 2019 levels. Prices decreased in
line with the movement in the underlying raw material prices in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2019. However, an effective product mix strategy was utilized such that the reduction in
realization levels was smaller than that of the underlying raw material prices. Nitriles revenues decreased in the year
ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by lower selling prices partially
offset by higher sales volumes. The average acrylonitrile sales price was approximately 19% lower in the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, driven by the fall in feedstock costs and market weakness,
with the U.S. market being predominately cost plus pricing. Sales volumes of acrylonitrile increased by approximately
5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, as the adverse impact of the COVID19 pandemic on volumes throughout most of 2020 was less than the impact of the unplanned outages at Green Lake and
Seal Sands during 2019. Revenues of the Phenol business decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to falling prices and lower sales volumes. Phenol and acetone sales volumes
were approximately 8% lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 as a result
of falling market demand, intensified by the global COVID-19 pandemic, and an unplanned outage at the Antwerp plant
during the year. Selling prices moved in line with the underlying raw material prices with phenol prices decreasing in the
year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, in line with a decline in benzene prices, whilst
acetone prices were also lower, reflecting the fall in propylene feedstock prices.

_EBITDA before exceptionals. EBITDA before exceptionals in the Chemical Intermediates segment decreased_

by €41.4 million, or 6.6%, to €585.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €626.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019. The Oxide business results in the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by lower margins. The decrease in margins in the year ended December 31,
2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 was a result of weaker margins on both commodity and specialised
products due to the adverse effect of COVID-19 on the general economic climate and increased competition which put
margins under pressure. Some margin relief was seen in the last quarter of 2020 due to increased demand from Asia and
some competitor outages in Europe. The Oligomers business profitability declined in the year ended December 31, 2020
as compared with the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to lower margins and lower volumes. The lower
margins were the result of LAO margins being adversely impacted across all regions as supply into the automotive,
drilling fluid and lubricant markets were impacted by COVID-19-related market weakness. PAO and SO margins for the
year ended December 31, 2020 set new records as strong European and North American margins offset weaker Asian
margins. Strong hi-viscosity sales supported the record PAO margins, whilst record SO margins benefitted from holding
realizations above declining feedstock costs. Volumes were lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to
the same period in 2019 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market demand. The Nitriles business
experienced an increase in profitability in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019,
primarily due to higher sales volumes and lower fixed costs, partially offset by lower margins. Sales volumes of
acrylonitrile increased by approximately 5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in
2019, as the adverse impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on volumes was less than the impact of the unplanned
outages at Green Lake and Seal Sands during 2019. The closure of the Seal Sand facility in December 2019 has led to
reduced fixed costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019. Margins decreased in the year ended
December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
market demand. The Phenol business profitability increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher margins, partially offset by lower volumes. Margins were higher
in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019, driven by higher acetone returns and
lower energy costs. Volumes were lower in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December
31,2019 primarily due to lower market demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and an unplanned outage at the
Antwerp plant during the year.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Capital Resources_**

Our historical liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from the need for us to meet our debt service

requirements, to fund capital expenditures for the general maintenance and expansion of our production facilities and for
new facilities, and to fund growth in our working capital.


-----

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations of subsidiaries, cash on our balance sheet and

borrowings under the Securitization Program and Inventory Financing Facility. Our ability to generate cash from our
operations depends on future operating performance, which is in turn affected by general economic, financial,
competitive market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

We believe that our operating cash flows, together with the cash resources and future borrowings under the

Securitization Program, the Project ONE Facilities, and Inventory Financing Facility, will be sufficient to fund our
working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and debt service requirements as they become due,
although this may not be the case.

We have also historically paid dividends to our shareholders. We may make strategic decisions, including the

payment of dividends, the size of which may change or increase from time to time, depending on the performance of the
business, and may not necessarily be in line with past practice.

In addition, we may engage in strategic transactions, including future debt incurrence in the capital and leverage

finance markets, including inventory financing or similar arrangements, or repurchases of our debt (on the open market
or otherwise) with cash on hand or the proceeds of future debt incurrences, which may impact the availability of cash
resources.

**_Financing Arrangements_**

The Group’s capital structure includes a mixture of secured term loans and secured notes. These various debt

instruments are denominated in both euro and U.S. dollars where appropriate, to approximately match the main
currencies of the cash flows generated by the Group’s operations.

The Group has a €800.0 million Securitization Program in place, which matures in December 2024. The Group

also has an Inventory Financing Facility in place, which matures in June 2023, although this is extendable by mutual
agreement.

The Group has a €300.0 million LC Facility in place. Under the terms of the facility the Group undertakes to

provide cash collateral to cover any letters of credit, guarantees, bonds or indemnities issued under the facility.

Following the Group’s purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker at Rafnes,

Norway from the Kerling group in July 2015, the Group assumed the obligations of a loan facility of Noretyl AS. In
November 2019, following the repayment of the initial loan, the loan facility was amended and restated with a new
facility amount of €250.0 million. In November 2022 the Group amended and extended the existing Rafnes facility to
€305.0 million, resulting in an additional drawdown of €126.5 million. The new facility matures in November 2027.

As part of a project at the Group’s Köln site to replace part of its incineration or cogeneration unit, the Group

entered into a €120.0 million loan facility. The facility matures in December 2024, together with a €60.0 million
additional loan facility which matures in June 2026.

As part of the Group’s purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE plant in Texas, United

States, from Sasol Chemicals on December 31, 2020, the Group amended and upsized the existing term loan facility
within the acquired legal entity, an Unrestricted Subsidiary. The amended loan facility was upsized to $600.0 million and
matures on October 31, 2027.

As of September 30, 2022, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, the Group had a total of €5,160.4 million

Senior Secured Term Loans, €550.0 million Senior Secured Notes due 2025, €325.0 million Senior Secured Notes due
March 2026, €770.0 million Senior Secured Notes due May 2026 and a €141.0 million Schuldschein Loan facility
outstanding. In November 2022, the Group entered into an incremental term loan facility under the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement to borrow an additional $1,200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027-II Dollar Senior Secured
Term Loans and €800 million aggregate principal amount of 2027-II Initial Euro Senior Secured Term Loans, the
proceeds of which were used, among other things, to repay a portion of the 2024 Senior Secured Term Loans. In
December 2022, the Group also repaid the Schuldschein Loan in full. In addition, in February 2023, the Group purchased
€44.8 million and $9.9 million aggregate principal amount of 2024 Senior Secured Term Loans in open market
transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

On December 7, 2022, the Group entered into the Rain Facility with an aggregate principal amount of RMB

1,045 million and $525.0 million in connection with the acquisition, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary, of a 50%
interest in SECCO. The Rain Facility is fully drawn, guaranteed by IGH and IHL, and matures in June 2026. In addition,
on December 22, 2022, the Group entered into project financing agreements in connection with Project ONE to borrow
loans of up to €3.5 billion to fund the majority of the capital expenditure plus associated financing costs during


-----

construction. The Project ONE Facilities are, during the construction phase, supported by a debt service undertaking
provided by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. We expect the Project ONE Facilities to be drawn in stages, beginning in the
first quarter of 2023 and throughout the construction period to 2026. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Rain
Facility” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.”

We or our affiliates may repay, redeem or repurchase any of our outstanding debt instruments, including term

loans and notes, at any time and from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to
one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and with such consideration as we or any such
affiliate may determine. The amounts involved may be material.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

As part of our strategy to focus capital investments on improving returns, we have instituted measures to ensure

the most efficient uses of capital investment. We intend to manage capital expenditures to maintain our well-invested
asset base.

During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and the nine-month periods ended September 30,

2022 and 2021, capital expenditures analyzed by business segment were as follows:

expenditures in the O&P Europe segment were at the Köln site on a cogeneration project, new office buildings and a
jetty, together with a turnaround on a small butadiene unit. The main expenditure in the Chemical Intermediates segment
was additional growth expenditure by the Oligomers business on the LAO and PAO platforms and a barge dock at
Chocolate Bayou, United States, as well as expenditure on LAO railcars. There was also expenditure within the Oxide
business at the Antwerp, Belgium site in respect of commissioning the alkox 6 unit and EO storage project which came
into operation during the first quarter of 2019, as well as some turnaround costs. The Phenol business also had
expenditure on a new cumene unit project in Germany whilst the Nitriles business had expenditure on a turnaround on its
ammonia unit in Köln. The remaining capital expenditure related primarily to sustenance expenditure.

We expect that our aggregate capital expenditure for 2022 will be approximately €1.0 billion, which includes

€0.2 billion in relation to Project ONE. We expect that our aggregate capital expenditure for 2023 will be approximately
€1.8 billion which includes €1.0 billion in relation to Project ONE.

**_Working Capital_**

We anticipate that our working capital requirements will vary due to changes in raw material costs, which affect

inventory and account receivables levels, and sales volumes. Working capital levels typically develop in line with raw
material prices, although timing factors can affect flows of capital. We expect to fund our working capital requirements
with cash generated from operations and drawings under our Securitization Program and Inventory Financing Facility.

_Cash flows from operating activities_

Net cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of €2,023.3 million for the nine-month period ended

September 30, 2022 (inflow of €1,883.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021). The inflow was
due to the profit generated from operations, partly offset by working capital outflows of €321.4 million in the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2022 (outflow of €657.1 million in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2021). The
working capital outflows in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 primarily reflected the higher working
capital levels of the Group due to increased raw material prices, and consequently product prices, in the period.

Net cash flow from operating activities was an inflow of €2,738.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021

compared to an inflow of €1,886.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The inflow was due to the profit
generated from operations, partly offset by working capital outflows of €736.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2021 compared to an inflow of €319.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The working capital outflows for


-----

the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily reflected the higher working capital levels of the Group due to increased
raw material prices, and consequently product prices, as crude oil prices increased significantly to an average of $71 per
barrel for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to an average of $42 per barrel for the year ended December
31, 2020. In addition, overall sales volumes increased by approximately 9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 which also resulted in higher levels of working capital.

compared to an inflow of €2,085.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The inflow was due to the profit
generated from operations and working capital inflows of €319.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
compared to an inflow of €337.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The working capital inflows for the year
ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected the lower working capital levels of the Group due to lower raw material
prices, and consequently product prices, which decreased significantly as crude oil prices decreased to an average of $42
per barrel for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to an average of $64 per barrel for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

Taxation payments of €112.8 million were made in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 (payments

of €232.5 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2021). The payments in the nine-month period ended

partially offset by tax refunds in the United States (including a refund under the CARES Act). The payments in the ninemonth period ended September 30, 2021 primarily reflected tax payments in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Norway,
Canada and the United States, some of which had been deferred from 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Taxation payments of €109.7 million were made for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to receipts of

€68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The payments for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily
reflected tax payments in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, Norway, Canada and the United States, some of which had
been deferred from 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. These payments were partially offset by further tax
refunds of $270.7 million from the United States under the CARES Act.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to a variety of market risks arising from fluctuations in

foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. To manage these risks effectively, we may enter
into hedging transactions and use derivative financial instruments, pursuant to established internal guidelines and
policies, to mitigate the adverse effects of these market risks. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

In the case of commodities, this exposure principally arises from movements in the prices of the feedstocks we

require to make our products. To manage this exposure, we generally acquire raw materials and sell finished products at
posted or market-related prices, which are typically set on a quarterly, monthly or more frequent basis in line with
industry practice. We seek to minimize reductions in our margins by passing through feedstock cost increases to our
customers through higher prices for our products.

Our cash flows and earnings are subject to exchange rate fluctuations. In our European petrochemical business,

product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs are denominated in euro and British pounds. From time to
time, we may enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to minimize the short-term impact of movements in
foreign exchange rates.

**Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments**

We have reviewed our selection and application of principal accounting policies and related financial

disclosures. The preceding discussion of past performance is based upon our consolidated financial information, which
has been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the audited
consolidated financial information. The application of these accounting policies requires that management make
estimates and judgments. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and
market and other conditions, and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from these
estimates due to actual market and other conditions, and assumptions being significantly different than was anticipated at
the time of the preparation of these estimates. Such differences may affect our financial results. We have chosen to
highlight certain policies that we consider critical to the operations of our business and understanding our consolidated
financial information. These policies have been discussed and agreed upon with our audit committee. We believe the
following estimates affect the application of our most critical accounting policies and require our most significant
judgments.

The following area is considered to involve a significant degree of judgment or estimation (this section should

be read in conjunction with notes 1 and 31 to the consolidated financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. as of
and for the years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively (included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum).

**Taxation**

Management is required to estimate the tax payable in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

This involves estimating the actual current tax charge or credit together with assessing temporary differences resulting
from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge
necessarily involves a significant degree of estimation in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally
determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal
process.

The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate transactions in the

countries in which it operates. After appropriate consideration, management makes provision for these liabilities based on
the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which is reliably measurable.

The breadth of the Group’s structure with operations in many geographic locations makes the use of estimates

and assumptions more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and can be
reliant upon the efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant jurisdictions in which the Group operates, and as a result,
issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.

**Impairment**

Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually or if there is an indication of impairment. Goodwill

impairments tests are based on cash generating units and compare the recoverable amount of the unit with the respective
carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of
disposal and its value in use. The value in use is determined using a discounted cash flow method, considering earnings


-----

forecasts of the unit. The management of the Group identified the operating segments as cash generating units (CGU) for
purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the
lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purpose. The goodwill is
internally monitored at the level of business units.

Impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognized when the recoverable

amount of the cash generating unit which includes the asset is lower than the respective carrying amount. In accordance
with the definition of a cash generating unit under IAS 36, the individual production plants generally do not represent
separate cash generating units, but are part of larger asset groups that form the cash generating units. Since the
assessment of whether goodwill or property, plant and equipment are impaired is based on long-term business plans for
the cash generating units and the determination of an appropriate discount rate, management used significant estimates
and assumptions in making these assessments.

**Post-Retirement Benefits**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-employment schemes. Under IAS 19 Revised Employee

Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined benefit obligation of each of the
defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined benefit schemes are determined using
actuarial valuations.

**Investments**

The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are

classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor.

The key accounting judgement taken in the preparation of the financial statements relates to our interest in the

Refining Business formerly owned by Group. The Refining Business is now owned by Petro China and INEOS
Investments, which in turn is held under common control by the Group’s controlling shareholders. The Group had an
economic interest in INEOS Investments via non-voting ordinary shares in INEOS Investments until December 2022,
when these shares were sold to a related party.

The Group has evaluated its interest in INEOS Investments and in the Refining Business, and has concluded

that, until the sale in December 2022, it had effective control over INEOS Investments by virtue of the facts that the
Group is subject to exposure and rights to the variable returns from INEOS Investments, INEOS Investments was held
under common control with the Group’s controlling shareholders and had the same directors as the Group. As a result,
INEOS Investments was treated as a subsidiary of the Group, and therefore the Refining Business was treated as a joint
venture under the equity accounting method, and the Group reflected its 50% share in the profits and losses of the
Refining Business in its income statement.

**Overview**

The petrochemicals markets comprise all products derived from crude oil and natural gas, and include olefins,

polymers and various petrochemical chemical intermediate products directly or indirectly derived from olefins. We
participate in the majority of these market segments, with a significant proportion of our profitability being derived from
the chemical intermediates sector.

In the refining industry, crude oil is refined into a number of products, including naphtha and liquid petroleum

gas, a significant proportion of which is used as feedstock for the production of olefins, such as ethylene and propylene.
In turn, a significant portion of these olefins are used as feedstock for the manufacture of polymers and petrochemical
derivatives, such as chemical intermediates.

Olefins are the basic building blocks used to create a variety of petrochemical products. Petrochemicals are

widely used in consumer and industrial applications ranging from plastics and packaging to construction and cosmetics.
Owing to their physical properties and affordability, petrochemicals and their derivatives continue to replace more
traditional materials, such as metal, glass, ceramics and wood, in an expanding list of end-use applications.

Chemical intermediates are high value-added chemical products used as key components in a wide variety of

consumer and industrial products. The chemical intermediates industry is less cyclical than the olefins industry; however,
demand for chemical intermediate products is affected by trends in demand in the various industries that are end users of
the products.

The industry overview detailed below summarizes the outlook for our key activities in the petrochemical and

chemical intermediates industries.

**Olefins & Polyolefins**

**_Overview_**

Olefins are the basic building blocks used to create a wide variety of petrochemical products. The key olefins

manufactured by the petrochemical industry are ethylene and propylene and these olefins are in turn used to produce
polyolefins and other olefin derivatives, such as ethylene oxide, acrylonitrile, vinyl chloride monomer, cumene and
oxo-alcohols. Butadiene, benzene and other aromatics are co-products of olefin manufacture, produced primarily from
steam cracking of naphtha. Polyolefins is the term used to collectively describe polypropylene and polyethylene
polymers, the world’s most widely used plastic materials. Polyolefins are manufactured by the process of polymerization
whereby individual molecules of ethylene and propylene are aggregated in polymer chains.

**_Manufacturing_**

Olefins are produced primarily by the steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In steam cracking, a gaseous

or liquid hydrocarbon feed, such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas or ethane, is diluted with steam and briefly heated in
a furnace without the presence of oxygen. Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the
reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the reaction time is further reduced to


-----

milliseconds, resulting in gas velocities faster than the speed of sound, to improve yield. After the cracking temperature
has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger. The products
produced in the reaction depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio and on the cracking
temperature and furnace residence time.

Light hydrocarbon feeds, such as ethane, liquefied petroleum gas or light naphtha, yield product streams rich in

the lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene and butadiene. Heavier hydrocarbon feeds (full-range and heavy
naphthas, as well as other refinery products) yield some of these products too, but also yield products rich in aromatic
hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in gasoline or fuel oil. Higher cracking temperatures (also referred
to as higher levels of “severity”) favor the production of ethylene and benzene, whereas lower cracking temperatures
(lower levels of “severity”) produce higher amounts of propylene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products.

Depending on feedstock, varying levels of ethylene, propylene and other by-products are achieved. Ethane

produces the most ethylene but the least propylene. Naphtha produces substantially less ethylene, roughly one-third of
that of ethane, but produces more propylene and significantly more by-products.

**Product Yield by Feedstock**

The main polyolefins are the thermoplastics, polyethylene and polypropylene, which are produced by the

polymerization of the olefin monomers ethylene and propylene, respectively. Polyolefins can either be homopolymers (a
combination of the same monomers) or copolymers (polymers that are produced from a combination of two or more
monomers).

Polyolefins are produced using a number of different technologies that are widely available, including one

high-pressure process and three low-pressure processes (Solution, Slurry and Gas Phase). All of the technologies are
constantly being adapted to improve product qualities and reduce production costs. For commodity products, produced
on modern scale technology, the cost structure of these technologies is similar. Increased cost structures for producing
specialty products are typically justified by premium margins.

The following is a summary of the four processes:

**_High-Pressure Process_**

This was the original process used to produce polyethylene and is still in use today. This process is a free radical

polymerization that does not require the use of a catalyst, operating at pressures above 1,000 and up to 3,500 bar and
temperatures from 150° to 340°C. Originally conducted in a high-pressure autoclave, current processes more commonly
use a tubular reactor. This process is used to produce low-density polyethylene, characterized by long-chain branching,
considerable flexibility and clarity. Because of the high-pressures involved, this process involves higher risk than
low-pressure processes and requires expensive and specialized equipment; consequently, fewer high-pressure processes
have been constructed in recent years.


-----

**_Low-Pressure Processes_**

These processes typically operate below 200 bar and have lower capital intensity but require the aid of a

catalyst. In addition, it is common to add a comonomer (butene or hexene in the case of polyethylene, and ethylene in the
case of polypropylene) to tailor the resultant polymer properties.

      - **_Solution Process._** This process operates at temperatures above the melting point of the polyolefin (above
130°C for polyethylene and above 140°C for polypropylene) and employs metallocene or Ziegler-Natta
catalysts and a solvent to dissolve the growing polymer chains. This process is best suited to make
high-density polyethylene (having very few chain branches, and those branches that do exist are short-only
a few carbon atoms in length) and linear low-density polyethylene (having many short-chain branches,
which may be contrasted to low-density polyethylene with many long-chain branches). Solution processes
have the ability to produce narrow molecular weight distribution polyolefins.

      - **_Slurry (or Suspension) Process._** This process is a continuous low temperature (60°-105°C, 20-35 bar for
polyethylene or 60°-85°C, 35-50 bar for polypropylene) process in which polymer forms as a solid particle
in the presence of a catalyst while suspended in a liquid slurry. In the case of polyethylene, the
polymerization takes place in an inert liquid carrier such as isobutane. In the case of polypropylene, the
polymerization takes place in liquid hexane, heptane, or even liquid propylene monomer. When propylene
is utilized as the carrier liquid, the process is often referred to as “bulk slurry.” The carrier liquid serves to
aid in the removal of heat as it carries the growing polymer particles through the reaction process. The
catalyst may be chromium on silica (polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. The reactor may be
a stirred tank or a pipe-loop reactor, in either case jacketed to aid in removal of the heat of reaction. One or
more reactors may be placed in series to broaden the molecular weight distribution and produce bimodal
polyolefins. This process is best suited to making high-density polyethylene and homopolymer
polypropylene. One advantage of this process over other high-density polyethylene processes is the ability
to make rapid grade transitions, which makes it particularly well suited to the manufacture of specialty
polyethylene products.

      - **_Gas Phase._** As the name implies, polymerization occurs with the solid polymer particles produced on a
heterogeneous catalyst in the gas phase. Like the slurry process, the catalyst may be chromium on silica
(polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. In the reactor, the growing polyolefin particles are
fluidized and cooled by the gaseous reactants and/or nitrogen, or sub-fluidized and mechanically agitated.
Liquid monomer may be added and flashed to aid in the removal of heat. The reaction takes place at low
temperature (80°-100°C for polyethylene and about 60°-85°C for polypropylene) and pressure (15-35 bar).
A gas phase process has advantages over slurry and solution processes in that the heat of reaction is very
effectively removed and operates with lower hydrocarbon inventories. In addition, high-ethylene content
copolymers of polypropylene can be produced in this process. This process is best suited to the manufacture
of linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene and all types of polypropylene, including
homopolymer, random copolymer, impact copolymer and soft thermoplastic polyolefin.

Post-polymerization, any catalyst is deactivated, the polyolefin is freed of any solvent, unreacted monomer or

liquid diluent, and the resulting polyolefin flake or crumb is combined with additives and extruded into pellets prior to
sale to downstream fabricators.

Several of these technologies have recently been adapted to run multiple reactions in series, yielding a product

with a wider bi-modal molecular weight distribution that provides superior strength or unique characteristics such as
high-impact resistance.

All polyolefin groups participate in mature markets and therefore larger plants of all process technologies are

being built with capacities of 300,000-500,000 tonnes per year.

**_Feedstock_**

The predominant feedstock for Europe and North East Asia is naphtha. The Middle East predominantly uses

natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), although there is very little very low cost ethane available for new crackers, which are
designed to crack a range of the heavier NGLs (i.e., propane, butane and heavier condensates). These feedstocks are
tradable as fuel, and thus have a significant opportunity value, which earlier tranches of essentially “distressed” ethane
did not (ethane is not practically tradable as a fuel). North American crackers have always had considerable in-built
feedstock flexibility, enabling operators to select the most economic feedstock (be it NGLs or naphtha) on the day. The
recent widespread exploitation of shale gas has caused fuel gas prices to fall well below those of other regions and has
also given rise to an abundance of associated NGLs (mainly ethane and propane). These NGLs are currently available to


-----

local cracker operators at a fraction of the equivalent cost of naphtha, thus bestowing a large commercial advantage on
North American NGL-based cracker operators. NGLs are the predominant feedstock for North American crackers.

The prices of naphtha and NGLs are influenced by numerous factors, including the balance between supply and

demand, oil and gas prices, and geopolitical factors. Because gas is not as readily transportable between regions as oil,
and the amount of interregional trade in gas is therefore limited, gas prices tend to vary by geographic region. In an
environment of relatively high oil prices, olefin facilities located in the Middle East enjoy the advantage of direct access
to gas feedstocks, which are priced lower than naphtha. Producers who are back-integrated to refineries have the ability
to capture margins across the value chain and to optimize feedstock types.

**_Products_**

According to NexantECA, worldwide demand for petrochemical products has grown at a rate greater than the

growth rate of GDP over the last 15 years, reflecting in part the ongoing substitution of thermoplastics for other industrial
materials, including paper, wood, glass and metal, and the change in consumption patterns of developing nations.
NexantECA projects demand growth for petrochemical products to be moderate as compared to historical levels, but
nonetheless to grow slightly faster than GDP on a worldwide basis as this penetration matures in established markets, and
despite petrochemical growth rates which can be below GDP growth rates for certain products in North America and
Western Europe. Between 2022 and 2027, NexantECA projects GDP to grow at an average annual growth rate of 2.2%
in North America, 1.9% in Western Europe and 4.0% in Northeast Asia. According to NexantECA, in Northeast Asia,
China’s economic growth over 2022-2027 is expected to ease to 4.9%, but the growth is still expected to be higher than
the other countries in the region.

NexantECA’s view of GDP and demand growth rates for petrochemical products varies by region and product

type, as detailed in the table below:

Set forth below is a description of the principal petrochemical products detailed above and their applications.

      - **_Ethylene._** According to NexantECA, ethylene is the world’s most widely used petrochemical in terms of
volume, accounting for over one-third of the global production of primary petrochemicals. It is the key
building block used to produce a large number of higher value added chemicals, including polyethylene,
polyvinyl chloride via ethylene dichloride and styrene via ethylbenzene. Ethylene is a flammable gas and is
a primary olefin obtained through a cracking process, as described above. Because ethylene is a gas, it must
be transported either by pipeline or in the form of a highly pressurized and refrigerated liquid, which is an
expensive means of transportation.

While ethylene itself has no consumer applications, demand for ethylene is driven essentially by its use as

feedstock for various thermoplastics, including polyethylene and other polymer derivatives. Thermoplastics are plastics
that soften when heated and harden again when cooled. Aside from being the feedstock for polyethylene production,
demand for ethylene is also driven by the manufacture of ethylene oxide and derivatives, ethylene dichloride and ethyl
benzene. These products are in turn used mainly in the production of other thermoplastics: PET, PVC and polystyrene,
respectively. According to NexantECA, the global market for ethylene is forecast to grow at 3.1% per annum through
2027 versus forecast GDP growth of 3.0% during the same period, driven by polyethylene applications such as
high-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene.

      - **_Propylene._** Propylene is a flammable gas which is derived as a co-product either of the refinery fluid
catalytic cracker process used to make gasoline or of the steam cracking process used to make ethylene.
More recently, propylene is also being produced from processes such as propane dehydrogenation and
metathesis. Propylene is an important feedstock for a significant number of industrial products and is the
main feedstock for polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Propylene is marginally easier to transport than
ethylene and may be shipped by pipeline, road, rail or ship.

Global propylene demand is driven essentially by its use as feedstock for various thermoplastics and by the level

of demand for propylene derivatives, particularly polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, oxo-alcohols, cumene
and acrylic acid. Growth in the demand for polypropylene has stemmed from the substitution of non-polymers (paper,
wood, glass and metal, etc.) for polypropylene due to its relative cost advantage and superior performance. According to
NexantECA, the global market for propylene is projected to grow at 3.4% per annum through 2027, driven mainly by
polypropylene demand.

      - **_Butadiene._** Butadiene is a gas and is one of the co-products of the steam cracking process used to
manufacture ethylene and propylene. Butadiene is used primarily in the production of polymers, principally
synthetic rubbers such as styrene-butadiene rubber, which is used to make tires and other rubber products.
Other polymers made from butadiene include acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene and styrene-butadiene latex.
Butadiene is also used to make ethylidene norbornene monomer.

Butadiene demand is driven primarily by growth in consumption of synthetic rubber. According to NexantECA,

the global market for butadiene is projected to grow at an average of 2.7% per annum through 2027. Demand is tightly
linked to the market for synthetic rubber, which is, in turn, mainly consumed in the automotive sector.

      - **_Benzene._** Benzene is used to produce a number of petrochemical intermediates, such as styrene, cumene
for phenol and acetone, cyclohexane and nitrobenzene. It is mainly produced from refinery processes or as a
co-product of steam cracker operations.

Styrene is the largest chemical outlet for benzene at around 49% of demand. The second largest outlet for

benzene, accounting for 20% of demand, is cumene, which is nearly all consumed in phenol production with acetone
formed as a co-product. For 2022, NexantECA estimated the global benzene demand to be 53.5 million tons, with 69%
being consumed in the production of ethylbenzene for the styrenics industry and cumene for the phenolics industry.
NexantECA forecasts an average global growth rate in demand of approximately 3.0% per year in the 2022-2027 period.

      - **_Polyethylene._** Polyethylene is the world’s most widely used thermoplastic and is made by the
polymerization of ethylene. Polyethylene is often classified by its density, because greater density
corresponds with greater material rigidity.

The world’s largest volume polyethylene is high density polyethylene (HDPE), which has a relatively high

degree of tensile strength. Plastic containers represent the most common household use of high density polyethylene. At
the opposite end of the spectrum is low density polyethylene (LDPE), which was the first type of polyethylene to be
developed. Flexible packaging represent the most common household use of low density polyethylene. Both high density
polyethylene and low density polyethylene are also commonly used for molding applications. Linear low density
polyethylene (LLDPE), which was developed in the 1970s, can usually be manufactured at a slightly lower cost than low
density polyethylene and has similar basic properties. While low density polyethylene and linear low density
polyethylene are to a certain extent substitutable for each other, one may be more suitable than the other for a specific
application.

Film is the largest single use of global polyethylene production and the primary driver of demand, representing

approximately one half of worldwide polyethylene consumption. Film includes a myriad of end use applications, from
food packaging to trash bags, stretch films and shrink films. Blow molding and injection molding are the next largest
uses and are also important demand drivers. In the blow molded category, blow molded bottles are the single largest end
use. NexantECA forecasts an average global growth rate in demand for polyethylene of approximately 3.3% per year in
the 2022-2027 period.

      - **_Polypropylene._** Polypropylene is the world’s second most widely used thermoplastic after polyethylene
and is among the fastest growing categories of thermoplastics. It is manufactured by the polymerization of
propylene. The rapid growth of polypropylene-based products reflects the superior cost and performance


-----

characteristics of this material. As one of the industry’s most versatile polymers, polypropylene is achieving
a portion of its growth by displacing other polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.

The largest end use segment of the polypropylene industry is injection molding, followed by film and sheet

applications. Injection molded polypropylene includes a wide variety of end uses, such as packaging, automotive and
appliances. End use segments for films and sheets include food bags, tape and wrappings for consumer goods.
Polypropylene is a thermoplastic characterized by its rigidity and resistance to high temperatures, chemicals and fatigue
combined with a greater density. Polypropylene has a heat distortion temperature of 140°C to 200°C, which makes it
particularly suitable for “hot fill” applications, which are manufactured using injection molding. As a result,
polypropylene is the most significant material used in molded containers and automotive applications. Polypropylene
fibers are also used in fabrics and carpets.

According to NexantECA, the global polypropylene market is projected to grow at 3.6% per annum through

2027. NexantECA expects that the demand for polypropylene in Asia will continue to grow at higher rates than North
America and Europe, primarily as a result of growth in the Chinese market.

**_Market Environment_**

Although the major costs of production are related to the costs of the relevant feedstocks and the scale of

operation, the olefins industry is primarily regional. This is due to high transportation costs. Prices are also indirectly
arbitraged by the trade flows in olefin derivatives (principally polymers), the markets for which are becoming
increasingly global. Polyolefins, in common with other segments of the chemicals industry, are subject to cyclical supply
and demand, although polyolefin demand growth has been historically strong, driven by the broadening range of end
uses.

The petrochemical industry is highly commoditized. Some polyolefins have subgrades that have properties

enabling them to be differentiated from commodity grades. These products account for a small portion of the overall
market, but carry a premium in the market and allow differentiation in the sector.

The construction of a new olefin manufacturing unit takes approximately five years from initial design to

completion. Producers are more likely to add capacity in periods when current or expected future demand is strong and
margins are, or are expected to be, high. Investments in new capacity can result in overcapacity, which typically leads to
a reduction of margins. In response to falling margins, producers typically shut uncompetitive assets or limit further
capacity additions, eventually causing the market to be relatively undersupplied. The alternation between periods of
substantial capacity addition and periods of limited capacity addition or reduction results in recognizable swings in
petrochemical capacity utilization, which typically result in swings in industry margins. This long-term pattern is often
referred to as the petrochemical cycle. The point in time of a given cycle with the lowest average margin across a product


-----

line is referred to as the “bottom of the cycle.” The point with the highest average margin is called the “peak of the
cycle.”

The petrochemical industry cycle is defined by the relative growth in capacity and consumption which causes

operating rates and profitability to rise and fall. Ethylene is the largest of the basic petrochemical markets, and its
operating rate cycle serves as a bellwether for the industry as a whole. According to NexantECA, the bottom of the last
ethylene cycle was reached in 2008, but the sharp recovery in 2009 was partly funded by unsustainable levels of
borrowing, leading to a second short downturn in consumption growth and operating rates in 2012. Consumption has
been increasing since, with global GDP growth recovering towards trend levels.

According to NexantECA, ethylene capacity grew by 11.7 million tons in 2021, while consumption increased by

9.2 million tons as the market emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating rates are set to accelerate to the bottom
of the forecast cycle as a result of ongoing heavy capacity addition over 2022-2023, before beginning a normal cyclical
recovery from 2024. The North American petrochemical industry has benefitted greatly due to the abundance of low
NGL feedstocks, as well as low energy costs. While U.S. gas prices have historically shown a strong correlation with oil
prices, they have now decoupled due to the abundant supply from shale gas exploitation. While the extremely low crude
oil prices in early 2020 momentarily brought ethylene costs from naphtha cracking close to parity with U.S. NGL-based
ethylene production, production in the United States again became highly competitive. The growth in NGL supply in
North America sparked a wave of investment in new capacity in the United States which is now passed its peak. In a
market where the marginal production is from oil-based capacity, the cost basis for oil-based production sets the global
price level. Export competitiveness and profitability of U.S. producers depends to a large extent on crude oil prices,
which set the prices of ethylene derivatives via naphtha cracking economics. The high crude oil prices since late 2021
have therefore ensured favorable conditions for U.S. ethylene production. While Europe suffers from stubbornly slow
demand growth, and high energy costs, its producers have benefitted from high valuations from the heavier steam cracker
co-products. Several steam crackers in Europe have been closed, but capacity is now broadly stable, and the improved
competitiveness of those crackers using imported NGL feedstock is now allowing both production and capacity to
increase. INEOS has taken the lead in securing ethane exports from the United States, now followed by SABIC and
Borealis. Furthermore, ExxonMobil and TOTAL Energies also now purchase ethane from the new storage facilities built
by INEOS in Europe. Despite project delays due to issues with environmental permitting and very high construction
costs, the U.S. ethylene capacity build is now toward the higher range of expectations. Energy security concerns and the
increased LNG demand from Europe to replace Russian gas is supportive of shale exploitation, with the Biden
administration calling for increased production and export capacity. With little additional low-priced feedstock available
in the Middle East, Chinese capacity developments occupy an increasing share of forecast capacity growth. Addition of
methanol-to-olefins (MTO) capacity in China is now much reduced according to NexantECA, and capacity growth in
China is from several new and very large refinery-integrated steam crackers, and coastal crackers based mostly on NGLs
imported from the United States. The following table sets forth the historical and projected supply and demand trends for
ethylene globally.

Addition of new ethylene capacity averaged 3 million tons per year from 2010-2015, but accelerated to seven

million tons per year over 2016-2020. Capacity addition will average over eleven million tons per year over 2021-2023,
but then decline. Expansion of the supply base in recent years has been largely due to new investments in Asia and the
United States. In NexantECA’s view, Asia will continue to lead global capacity investments in the coming years with
steam cracker developments in China and other Asian countries such as India, Indonesia and South Korea. The ethylene
capacity base in Asia will expand by a total of 11 million tons per year over 2022-2027, while capacity growth in North
America will be around 4 million tons per year. NexantECA expects ethylene production in China from methanol to have
peaked at 22% in 2017, but decline to 15% by 2027 as a result of more rapid addition of steam cracking capacity. MTO
capacity addition has continued despite the fall in crude oil prices, although recent high coal prices and the dual-control
emissions legislation count against new project development. Some MTO plants based on purchased methanol have been
uneconomical and production has been halted for extended periods. The competitive situation reversed at times in 2022
however, as very high oil prices restored the competitiveness of MTO based on purchased methanol, while the normally
more competitive coal-based MTO (CTO) was hit by a spike in coal prices of similar proportion to that of naphtha.
Investments in North America, stimulated by abundant supplies of low cost NGL have driven a resurgence in new
capacity, although capacity addition in the United States has also now dropped. NexantECA states that U.S. ethylene
capacity has increased by 14.6 million tons per year over 2015-2022, and that only 4.0 million tons of new U.S. ethylene
capacity may be seen in the United States by 2027. Ethylene is consumed in many diverse products and industry sectors,
however overall consumption is largely driven by economic activity. It is important to note that the world needs
approximately 6 million tons per annum of new capacity to meet growth at the rate that NexantECA predicts at 3.1% per
annum over 2022-2027. This means four to five new crackers per year just to meet global growth. Exports of surplus
ethane are driving modifications of existing crackers in other regions, and also some new NGL cracking capacity is under
development in China, which is to be based on imported ethane and propane, as well as some new domestic supply.
Reduced availability of advantaged feedstocks will restrict future investments in the Middle East, and following the
startup of Sadara, there are currently no firm cracker projects in Saudi Arabia. Ethylene supply growth in Iran is
contingent on a significant near-term increase in ethane supply, which has allowed increased production since 2017.
Despite commissioning more gas production assets in the South Pars field however, Iran continues to face severe gas
shortages which restrict petrochemicals production.

NexantECA’s forecast shows global operating rates declining slowly to a trough around 82% by 2023, with the

implication that cracker operators will experience pressure on margins with the long-standing relationship between
profitability and operating rates maintained. However, NexantECA also forecasts that operating rates will then recover to
a peak of 86% by 2028. The average age of many naphtha crackers in Europe and Asia is now around 40 years and these
older assets are becoming increasingly expensive to maintain in a safe and economic operating condition. Often, the need
for a major scheduled turnaround (typically every three to five years) is the point at which the viability of these aging
assets is reassessed, and a pragmatic decision is taken to close them. There have been several such closures in Europe in
recent years (including the Group’s old “G4” naphtha cracker unit at Grangemouth). Versalis closed its 490,000 tons per
year cracker at Porto Marghera in early 2022.

The new ethylene export terminal in the United States may periodically increase pressure on the older assets. In

addition, the high incidence of unplanned outages of petrochemical assets in all regions has over the last two years been a
major feature influencing the supply/demand balance of many products (including ethylene, polyolefins, acrylonitrile and
phenol). As existing plants continue to age, it will become more difficult to forecast an aggregate improvement in
industry reliability, and thus, this may be expected to affect the actual supply/demand balance and thus the margins for
the affected products. NexantECA also notes that the cyclical nature of the industry is likely to continue, but timing is
notoriously difficult to forecast and is largely based on assumptions of an eight-year business cycle longer term.

While margins are primarily determined by the position in the cycle and relative feedstock/product positions,

they are also susceptible to potentially significant swings in the short term. This volatility, which may be global or
isolated in individual regions, can be caused by a number of factors, including fluctuations in utilization rates due to
planned or unplanned plant outages, political and economic conditions driving rapid changes in prices for key feedstocks,
exchange rate fluctuations and changes in inventory management policies by petrochemical customers (such as inventory
building or restocking). According to NexantECA, integrated polyolefin margins in Western Europe recovered above
their long term average by mid-2022 despite high feedstock prices. Production reliability has improved considerably after
the rush to realize a long-awaited recovery in profitability, restoring a lengthy supply base. European producers face
increased pressures from low cost imports, with high cost naphtha remaining the dominant feedstock even after further
penetration of imported NGLs. Abundant supplies of NGL feedstock will continue to provide a strong cost advantage to
U.S. producers despite increasing demand for new domestic crackers and export infrastructure for NGLs and ethylene.
INEOS is, however, uniquely placed to take advantage of these developments due to its Dragon Class vessels, which are
capable of carrying both ethane and ethylene, and its Zwijndrecht import terminal in Belgium, which is capable of
receiving large ocean-going vessels. Accordingly, INEOS vessels have been observed lifting larger ethylene cargoes out
of the United States than other companies, ensuring advantaged supply for its European downstream operations.


-----

Integrated polyolefin margins in the United States have come down from their recent record highs as global

derivative pricing has fallen along with crude oil prices, and the increasing supply surplus seeks more distant export
markets outside traditional opportunities in South America. Resin prices are set to fall below European prices and
approach the floor set in Asia. Management believes that new plant builds are likely to be less than those expected by
NexantECA and due to ageing of industry assets, industry reliability is considered unlikely to improve in the medium
term. Consequently, the supply/demand balance—the key driver of industry profitability—is likely to be better than that
assumed by NexantECA. NexantECA’s forecast shows global operating rates declining slowly to a trough of around 81%
by 2023, with the implication that cracker operators will experience pressure on margins with the long-standing
relationship between profitability and operating rates maintained. However, NexantECA also forecasts that operating

**Chemical Intermediates**

**_Overview_**

Chemical intermediates are higher-value-added chemical products used as key components in a wide variety of

consumer and industrial products. Olefins are a key raw material and are used to produce a wide range of products,
including phenol, acetone, alpha olefins, ethylene oxide and derivatives and nitriles.

**_Manufacturing_**

Chemical intermediates are manufactured without exception in built-for-purpose plants that utilize technology

specific to the product or products produced. Integration or close proximity to raw materials is not absolutely essential,
but we believe it offers a strategic advantage by reducing logistics costs because large volumes of raw materials are often
required. We also believe that scale is often critical to the successful manufacture of chemical intermediates because
manufacturing costs per tonne produced decrease as plant size increases. Competition therefore tends to drive research
and technology efforts toward developing technologies which support larger plant outputs as well as higher yields.
Therefore, successive generations of plants are typically larger than previous generations and often produce higher yields.

**_Feedstock_**

For most processes, feedstock costs are the most significant cost item. The costs of the feedstocks required (such

as, ethylene, propylene, and benzene) are principally driven by the price of oil and natural gas.

Set forth is a description of the principal chemical intermediates we provide, their applications and their demand

outlook:

      - **_Ethylene Oxide and Derivatives._** This range includes ethylene oxide, ethylene glycol, propylene oxide and
propylene glycols.

Ethylene oxide is a highly hazardous product to transport. As a result, customers and end-use applications tend

to be co-located or closely located to ethylene oxide production facilities. This leads to a regional market place for
ethylene oxide with many opportunities for differentiation.

The most common derivative of ethylene oxide is ethylene glycol. This is very safe to transport and is viewed as

a commodity petrochemical. As such, the market place for ethylene glycol is global, with pricing highly influenced by
supply-demand balances. Ethylene glycol is primarily used in the manufacture of polyesters and antifreeze/coolants.

Propylene oxide is also a hazardous product to transport, but is moved routinely over modest distances. It is sold

into a regional market with opportunities for differentiation. The major application of propylene oxide is in the
manufacture of polyols followed by propylene glycol, which in turn is primarily used to produce polyesters, paints and
coatings, aircraft de-icing chemicals, antifreeze and industrial coolants. Propylene glycol is a safe product to transport
and trades in a commodity market place. Other ethylene oxide derivatives are manufactured by reacting ethylene oxide
with bases, such as glycol, ammonia and other alcohols.

Ethylene oxide demand is driven by the market requirement for ethylene oxide derivatives, principally ethylene

glycol. As a result of increased consumption of polyester, ethylene glycol has become the second largest application for
ethylene after polyethylene. Similarly, propylene oxide demand is driven by the market requirement for propylene oxide
derivatives, principally propylene glycol.

NexantECA forecasts that global demand for ethylene oxide will continue to grow steadily, although the

penetration of coal/oxalate based mono ethylene glycol production in China will curtail growth rates below those seen
historically. NexantECA estimates that 40% of Chinese mono ethylene glycol was produced from coal in 2022,
displacing conventional production from ethylene oxide, but the proportion is decreasing as a result of several new
world-scale conventional MEG plants in China.

Extremely high coal prices have also undermined coal-based MEG economics in 2022, even against the

backdrop of much higher crude oil prices. Catalyst improvements enabled a major increase in MEG production via the
coal/oxalate route in 2016, notably reducing China’s import requirement for MEG by over one million tons versus 2015.
Jiutai New Material is building a new 1 million tons per year MEG plant in China, using a new Davy
syngas/methanol/formaldehyde based MEG process. The process potentially offers a lower cost route from coal to MEG,
without the restrictions of small line size which affect the economics of the coal/oxalate process. After a period of
relatively modest investment in EO/MEG over 2010-2018, global MEG capacity has increased by 19 million tons per
year since 2018. Around one third of this new capacity was coal-based units in China, which ran at low rates over 2022
due to high coal prices. Supply growth in North America and Asia accounts for most of the new supply, with relatively
little coming from the Middle East. New capacity and increased recycling of polyester will contribute to further erosion
in operating rates towards a trough of 63% in 2023, although some new projects may be deferred to avoid this.
Management notes that the Group’s business is not particularly sensitive to the supply/demand dynamics of glycol
because the Oxide Business is primarily a specialties business, adding value to ethylene oxide, and is therefore not
particularly sensitive to changes in glycol supply/demand.


-----

      - **_Acrylonitrile._** Acrylonitrile is a well-established commodity that has been in commercial use for more
than 70 years. It is used in the production of acrylic fiber, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and styreneacrylonitrile. Acrylic fiber is used in a wide variety of consumer products, including clothing and carpets.
Acrylonitrile is manufactured from propylene, ammonia and air with the use of a purpose-made special
catalyst. Acrylonitrile is toxic, flammable and, unless chemical stabilizers are added for storage and
shipment, explosive. The building of new production plants for acrylonitrile is particularly expensive.

Historically, acrylonitrile demand has been driven by demand for acrylic fiber. More recently, acrylonitrile

butadiene styrene (ABS) and styrene-acrylonitrile polymers have taken over as the main drivers of demand for
acrylonitrile. As with other petrochemicals, the growth in demand for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and styreneacrylonitrile polymers has been greatest in Asia, while demand in North America and Europe has declined. Currently,
Asia is a major net importer of acrylonitrile and derivatives, with a significant proportion of the Asian imports coming
from North America. Acrylonitrile is sometimes viewed as a mature product, with global annual demand growth rate
forecast at an average of 3.3% through to 2027 according to NexantECA.

      - **_Alpha olefins._** Alpha olefins include linear alpha olefins and poly alpha olefins. Linear alpha olefins are
hydrocarbons in a chain formation with physical characteristics and commercial uses that vary according to
the length of the hydrocarbon chain. Ethylene is the primary feedstock for the production of linear alpha
olefins, and linear alpha olefins, in turn, are important feedstocks for the manufacture of certain types of
polyethylene. Linear alpha olefins have many applications in the petrochemical industry, including as
surfactant intermediates, base oil for synthetic lubricants and drilling fluids. Demand for linear alpha olefins
has increased substantially since they first became commercially available.

Poly alpha olefins, which are made by merging several linear alpha olefins together, are primarily used as

synthetic lubricants. Poly alpha olefins are value-added products as compared with linear alpha olefins, and, accordingly,
command higher margins. However, poly alpha olefins account for only approximately 10% of the overall market for
alpha olefins.

Producers of linear alpha olefins may be divided into two groups: “full-range” producers, which manufacture

the entire range of linear alpha olefins and “on purpose” or “single product” producers, which specialize in those linear
alpha olefins which historically have experienced the fastest growth. Demand for linear alpha olefins has experienced an
increasing divergence between demand for linear alpha olefins with shorter carbon chains, which has grown more
quickly, and demand for linear alpha olefins with higher carbon chains, which on average has experienced slower
growth. As a result, the industry has focused on developing single product technologies to target the fastest growing
linear alpha olefins. Demand for poly alpha olefins is driven by the need for higher performing lubricants offering
improved fuel economy, lower emissions, improved cold start properties and longer drain intervals.

      - **_Phenol and acetone._** Phenol and acetone are produced simultaneously from cumene in the four-stage
Hock production process and are essential starting materials for a wide range of applications in the
electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture industries. In the production of
downstream substances, neither phenol nor acetone may be substituted. The markets for phenol and acetone
are traditionally viewed as regional because of the physical difficulty of transporting and storing phenol and
the resulting high freight costs, with regional production responding mainly to regional demand. Individual
regions experience independent cost bases, though there are limits to interregional price differentials, set by
freight costs.

NexantECA projects global phenol demand to grow on average at 3.4% per annum to 2027. Current announced

capacity additions indicate that the global industry will operate at between 80% and 84% of capacity between now and
2027. More capacity—as yet unannounced—may be added, but we believe that this will not significantly adversely affect
the supply and demand balance.

**_Market Environment_**

Chemical intermediates are sometimes classified within the generic description of petrochemical products,

essentially because they, like polyolefins, tend to utilize olefins or olefins derivatives as their primary feedstock.
However, unlike polyolefins, the market place for chemical intermediate products often involves a global customer base.
There are also far fewer competitors for each product, with technology ownership and scale of operation being key to
obtaining leading market positions. Access to the whole global market may, in some cases, not be possible when margins
are insufficient to accommodate incremental freight costs to distant regions.

The relationship between supply and demand for chemical intermediates tends to be cyclical, although to a

lesser extent than for olefins and polymers. Suppliers tend to have more ability to pass cost increases through to their
customers. Margins typically increase when demand approaches available supply. This is primarily because product


-----

supply is driven by periods of substantial capacity additions and followed by periods in which no or limited capacity is
added.

In addition, product demand fluctuates with overall economic conditions. Market volatility for chemical

intermediates varies by product, with the wide range of applications for the different products providing a natural hedge
for demand across the range.

**Introduction**

We are one of the world’s largest chemical companies as measured by revenue. Our business has highly

integrated world class chemical facilities and production technologies. We have leading global market positions for a
majority of our key products and a strong and stable customer base. We currently operate 33 manufacturing sites in six
countries throughout the world. We are led by a highly experienced management team with, on a combined basis, over
100 years of experience in the chemical industry. As of September 30, 2022, our total chemical production capacity was
approximately 23,000 kta, of which 55% was in Europe and 45% was in North America.

We operate our business through three segments: Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins & Polymers North

America and Chemical Intermediates. The products we manufacture are derived from crude oil and natural gas, and
include olefins, polymers and various petrochemical products directly or indirectly derived from olefins. Our products
serve a broad and diverse range of end markets, including packaging, construction, automotive, white goods/durables,
agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Our highly integrated, world class production facilities and technological know-how allow us to process raw

materials into higher value-added products. In Europe, we own two sites integrated with crackers and polymer units.
Typically, these two sites account for approximately 76% of our European olefin and polymer volumes. The polyolefins
plants on our two major sites in Europe normally receive more than 95% of their feedstock supply from our integrated
crackers. Similarly, in the United States, much of our olefin feedstock requirements for our polymer business is supplied
by either our Chocolate Bayou cracker in Texas or by integrated third-party facilities, such as the Tesoro facility in
Carson, California. We believe that with our highly integrated facilities we are able to capture attractive margins across
the value chain, enjoy greater certainty of feedstock supply, reduce logistical costs, improve energy management and
optimize our product slate.

The extent of our business integration from upstream to downstream for our major products is summarized as

We benefit from the cost advantages of operating large scale, well invested, highly integrated facilities

strategically located near major transportation facilities and customer locations. Since January 1, 2007, we and our
predecessors have invested approximately €10.7 billion (including investments in divested assets) in our production
facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting in integrated, and state of the art production units. This includes
significant investments of almost €3.5 billion in the last five years to further enhance our assets’ capabilities. We believe
these investments allow us to operate at lower cost and higher utilization rates than most of our competitors, and enable
us to maintain positive margin and cash flows even during downturns in industry cycles or customer demand. For the
twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022, our revenue was €21.8 billion and our EBITDA before exceptionals was
€3.3 billion.

Over the past several years, we have implemented a range of strategic initiatives designed to lower our operating

costs, increase our profitability and further enhance our market position. These include fixed asset investments to expand
our capacity in higher value products, to enhance productivity at our existing facilities, and to reduce our fixed cost
structure through headcount reductions, production line closures and system upgrades. In addition, we have shifted our
product portfolio to focus on more differentiated products, exited low-margin businesses and implemented premium
pricing strategies designed to improve our margins. We believe these initiatives provide us with a strong platform to
drive growth, create significant operating leverage and position us to benefit from volume recovery in our end markets.

Since April 1998, when INEOS was established with the acquisition of the Belgian “Oxide” assets from

Inspec plc, we have significantly expanded, both through a series of strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets from
major chemical companies, and through organic growth. The combination of INEOS and Innovene in December 2005
represented a transformational milestone for our company, providing global scale and further upstream integration.

In 2011, we transferred our Refining Business, our Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business and certain

infrastructure assets to three joint ventures outside the INEOS Group. Please see “Business—Refining Divestiture,
Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Refining Divestiture” for a further description of the disposal of
our Refining Business and Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business.

In 2013, we completed the Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our

indirect parent company. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Grangemouth Divestiture.”

In 2014, we divested the olefins and polymers assets and Chemical Intermediates assets of the Lavéra site. See

“Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Lavéra Divestiture.”

In 2015, we completed the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker at Rafnes,

Norway from the INOVYN group (formerly the Kerling Group), a related party. In 2015, we also acquired aromatics and
cumene assets from Axiall Corporation. The acquisition comprised the world’s largest cumene plant in Pasadena, Texas.
In addition, Axiall’s phenol, acetone and alpha-methylstyrene business was transferred to the INEOS phenol facility at
Mobile, Alabama.

In 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one of the largest high density

polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America. Moreover, in 2016, following a strategic review of the
INEOS Technologies business, we decided to cease marketing its polyolefins licensing technology externally and to
transfer the remaining parts of the INEOS Technologies business to existing businesses within the Group to provide a
clearer focus on individual product lines.

In 2019, the Group acquired the INESCO combined heat and power plant at the Antwerp site in Belgium.

In December 2020, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Gemini HDPE joint venture from

Sasol Chemicals. The principal activity of the company is the production of high density polyethylene in La Porte, Texas,
United States. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100% through Unrestricted Subsidiaires (as
defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement). Prior to the acquisition the Group reflected its
50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture. A Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in the Indentures and the Senior Secured
Term Loans Agreement) of the Group is the operator of the facility and has the exclusive right to supply Gemini with the
required components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the HDPE products and to take such quantity
of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE
Term Loans.”

In December 2021, the Group acquired the assets of Charter Plastics in Titusville, United States, a manufacturer

of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe products.

In the summer of 2022, the Group began construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp, Belgium, for

the production of ethylene with a nameplate capacity of approximately 1,450 kta, along with associated utilities, tankage
and infrastructure (“Project ONE”). We believe Project ONE is the largest investment in the European chemicals
industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be among the most environmentally-friendly of its kind. It is planned to
be equipped with the best available technologies with a high efficiency in use of raw materials and energy, CO2
emissions that are expected to be less than half of the currently best performing similar units in Europe from the outset
and a clear path to carbon neutrality on a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis within 10 years of start-up of the cracker. See also
“Risk Factors—Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or developments may prove difficult for
us to consummate,” “Risk Factors—Litigation—We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us,
and adverse results may harm our business” and “Business—Facilities—Project ONE.”

In August 2022, the Group agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui

Chemicals for approximately $330.0 million, which will add more than 1,000 kta of capacity, including for cumene,
phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A, upon completion (expected in the first quarter of 2023).

In December 2022, the Group acquired for approximately RMB 10.5 billion, through an Unrestricted

Subsidiary, a 50% interest in the Shanghai SECCO Petrochemical Company Limited facility in Shanghai, China
(“SECCO”). The remaining 50% is owned by SINOPEC. SECCO has a capacity of 4,200 kta of petrochemicals,
including ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, polystyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, benzene and
toluene. The Group also agreed to acquire, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary, a 50% interest in a new petrochemical
complex being built in China, which is currently under construction by SINOPEC and is expected to be on-stream by the
end of 2023 (the “Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project”). This complex also includes a new 500 kta HDPE (HighDensity Polyethylene) plant.

(1) The assets of INEOS Chemicals Grangemouth Limited and INEOS Commercial Services UK Limited were
transferred out of IGH on October 1, 2013 in connection with the Grangemouth Divestiture, and the Lavéra
Divestiture assets were transferred out of IGH on July 1, 2014; therefore, their capacity has been excluded from
the full-year capacity figures. However, for the estimation of market ranking for IGH their capacities have been
included since these assets remain within the broader INEOS family of companies and there has been no
restriction to, or change in, the competitive dynamic that the assets exercise within the European market as a
part of the INEOS family of companies. Therefore, in management’s view, it is helpful to consider the
Grangemouth and Lavéra assets in order to reflect the relative overall commercial strength of the INEOS family
of companies, which is the same as that of O&P Europe within IGH.

(2) According to NexantECA, measured by average annual capacity, we are the second largest manufacturer of high
density polyethylene in Western Europe and the third largest manufacturer of linear low density polyethylene in
Europe.

_Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins & Polymers North America_

In our olefins and polymers businesses, we produce olefins, other cracker products, such as butadiene and

benzene, and a broad range of polyolefin polymers. We are among the largest producers of olefins and polymers in the
world. The focus of our olefins business in Europe and North America is on ethylene and propylene, which are the two
largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. The olefins we make are primarily used as
feedstock for our derivatives businesses. In addition, we sell olefins to third-party customers for a variety of industrial
and consumer applications, including the manufacture of plastics, rubber and fiber. In our polymers business, we focus
on polyethylene and polypropylene.

We operate a total of 19 sites for olefins and polyolefins, including our large integrated olefins cracker and

polyolefin facilities at Köln, Germany, Rafnes, Norway, and Chocolate Bayou, Texas, United States and nine
polyethylene pipe manufacturing sites within the United States. These facilities support our highly competitive


-----

proprietary polyolefin process technologies. The technologies include our cost-effective gas phase polypropylene
technology, our specialized technology for high-density polyethylene and our flexible proprietary “swing” technology for
both linear low-density and high-density polyethylene.

The North American and European markets for olefins and polyolefins are quite distinct, with separate pricing

structures and distribution channels. As a result, each market may experience different rates of growth and levels of
return. Therefore, we operate these two businesses separately and report them as two distinct segments—INEOS
Olefins & Polymers Europe and INEOS Olefins & Polymers North America. For the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2022, our Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins & Polymers North America businesses contributed
€9.5 billion and €6.0 billion of revenue (excluding intersegmental eliminations) and €775.4 million and €1,372.4 million
of EBITDA before exceptionals, respectively (including, in each case, intersegmental eliminations).

_Chemical Intermediates_

Chemical intermediates are higher-value-added chemical products used as key components in a wide variety of

consumer and industrial products. In our Chemical Intermediates business, we utilize olefins as key raw materials and
produce a wide range of products, including phenol, acetone, alpha olefins, ethylene oxide and derivatives, acrylonitrile,
ammonia and nitriles.

We have four main product groups within our Chemical Intermediates business: INEOS Nitriles, INEOS

Oligomers, INEOS Oxide and INEOS Phenol. We have a total of 16 manufacturing sites globally, with many of our
plants integrated either directly with their key raw materials on-site, or integrated via pipeline connection. In August
2022, we agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals, which will add
more than 1,000 kta of capacity, including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A, upon
completion (expected in the first quarter of 2023).

We are the world’s leading producer of phenol, which is an essential starting material for a wide range of

applications in the electrical/electronics, automotive, construction and household/furniture industries. Our main product
in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibers and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
plastic. We are also among the largest volume suppliers of linear and poly alpha olefins in the world. According to
NexantECA, we are the second largest producer of ethylene oxide in Western Europe. We have a range of associated
products, including ethylene glycol, propylene oxide, propylene glycol and acetate esters. We manufacture and supply
high-quality catalysts and additives in support of various technologies to major companies around the world, and also to
our own manufacturing assets. For the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022, our Chemical Intermediates
revenue and EBITDA before exceptionals were €10.2 billion and €1,114.8 million, respectively, excluding
intersegmental eliminations.

**Our Competitive Strengths**

We believe that the factors set forth below provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets in which we

compete:

      - **_Diversified Portfolio of Businesses with Leading Market Positions._** We are one of the world’s largest
chemical companies. We operate 33 manufacturing sites in six countries around the world. These assets
have a total production capacity of approximately 23,000 kta as of September 30, 2022. We believe we
have a top 5 or better global or regional market position in 12 of our key products.

Our petrochemical products are utilized in a wide range of end-market applications. The following diagram sets

forth our petrochemicals revenue by end use application in 2021.


-----

**Petrochemicals Revenue by Application 2021**

Our petrochemical products are sold to customers in diverse geographic locations. The following diagram sets
forth the group third party revenue by region in 2021.

**Group Third Party Revenue by Region 2021**

We believe that such application and market diversity reduces the effect of industry cyclicality on our results. In

addition, we believe that we benefit from the fact that the supply and demand dynamics of the cycles relating to our
petrochemical products are fairly independent, which helps mitigate some of the cyclicality in the industry.

      - **_Vertically Integrated, World-Scale Producer._** We have three large-scale petrochemical sites, accounting
for approximately 41% of our total petrochemical production capacity as of September 30, 2022. Each of
these sites is integrated with a major cracker and/or polymers and derivatives unit.

We operate one of the largest single-site ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol plants in Europe and the two largest

phenol plants in Europe, one of which is the largest in the world, as well as the largest single train phenol plant in North
America. We operate the largest acrylonitrile facility in the world and one of the largest high-density polyethylene
complexes in North America. We believe that our existing plants have sufficient capacity such that as our production
volumes increase, we will be able to leverage our fixed cost base and increase our profitability.

Our sites are typically located near raw materials, refineries and associated pipeline infrastructure. We believe

our highly integrated facilities provide us with the ability to capture margins across the value chain, enjoy certainty of


-----

feedstock supply (particularly for ethylene), reduce logistical costs, improve energy management, adjust the product slate
to capture greater value (by selling olefins or, alternatively, by using them internally in the production of polymers or
derivatives) and reduce our exposure to margin volatility as a result of changes in raw material prices. We operate large
plants that permit us to spread fixed costs over large volumes of production, thereby reducing unit costs and enhancing
profits.

      - **_Well-Invested, Highly Efficient Production Facilities._** Our large, well-invested plants benefit from
economies of scale and favorable locations. Our acquisition activity has focused on acquiring businesses
that complement our existing manufacturing facilities with well-invested physical assets from major
chemical companies. In addition, each year we continue to invest in improving and expanding our facilities.
Since January 1, 2007, we and our predecessors have invested approximately €10.7 billion (including
investments in divested assets) in our production facilities to ensure that they operate efficiently, resulting
in integrated, and state-of-the-art production units. This includes significant investments of almost
€3.5 billion in the last five years to further enhance our assets’ capabilities.

      - **_Extensive Portfolio of Leading Proprietary Technologies._** We have a broad portfolio of proprietary
manufacturing technologies which we use for the manufacturing of our key products. We believe that they
enable us to be one of the lowest cost producers and provide us with a significant competitive advantage in
terms of product quality, and we continue to improve the portfolio through focused research and technology
investments.

      - **_Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record._** Our senior management team has been
operating INEOS and our predecessors for over 20 years and has a demonstrated track record of achieving
profitable growth in the chemical industry, successfully integrating large acquisitions, dramatically
reducing the fixed cost base, and deleveraging the business following such acquisitions. James A. Ratcliffe,
our controlling shareholder, and the other existing shareholders have a successful record of investing in the
chemical industry. Across the wider INEOS group, including our ultimate parent company and its other
subsidiaries, we have completed 38 significant acquisitions since the formation of INEOS in 1998. Each of
these acquisitions has been integrated effectively and we have been able to achieve significant cost-savings
in the acquired businesses. Our management team has extensive experience in the chemical industry,
including working for leading companies such as ICI, DuPont, Dow, Degussa and BP, and a proven ability
to increase productivity, reduce costs and control capital expenditures and working capital. We believe the
experience of our management team is a distinct competitive advantage.

In addition, our senior management team has demonstrated the ability to streamline our businesses by
focusing on core competencies and disposing of non-core or underperforming businesses. In the past 12
years, we have disposed of three non-core or underperforming businesses. We disposed of the Refining
Business and the Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business in July 2011. On October 1, 2013, we completed the
Grangemouth Divestiture to a newly created subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our indirect parent
company. See “Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The
Grangemouth Divestiture.” On July 1, 2014, the Group completed the Lavéra Divestiture to a new
subsidiary of INEOS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Group at the time of the divestiture. See
“Business—Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture—The Lavéra
Divestiture.” The disposal of these three businesses has enabled us to focus management time on core
activities, reduce our capital expenditure requirements going forward and also reduce our exposure to
underperforming cash consuming businesses.

      - **_Access to Advantaged Feedstocks._** Our Chocolate Bayou cracker installation in the United States uses
natural gas liquids-based feedstocks, such as ethane, as its main feedstocks. This allows us to benefit from
the current low-cost supply of ethane resulting from the growth in the supply of shale gas in the United
States. Ethane is also a lower-cost feedstock than naphtha in Europe, where we operate a very efficient gas
olefin cracker in Rafnes. In 2019, our butane storage tank contract was signed to provide the largest ever
built in Europe. The tank came on stream in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium in October 2020. Our other
olefin cracker in Europe, at Köln, is a naphtha cracker, but it has significant gas cracking flexibility. Our
ability to use lower-cost feedstocks, like ethane and butane, gives us an advantage over our competitors
with crackers that cannot accept such a significant mix of gas feedstocks, and must rely on more expensive
naphtha. The gas cracking flexibility has been enhanced further with expanded butane supply to our cracker
in Köln supported by four Rhine river barges. Contracts for supply of four Rhine river barges were signed
in 2018 with delivery of three in 2020 and the fourth delivery in 2021. In the summer of 2022, we began
construction of a new ethane steam cracker in Antwerp, Belgium for the production of ethylene. We believe
it is the largest investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it to be
among the most environmentally-friendly of its kind.


-----

In addition, our Chocolate Bayou cracker and our naphtha crackers in Europe can also use naphtha as a
feedstock, allowing us to manage our feedstock mix in response to changes in economic and market
conditions and maximize our margins. Our fleet of eight long-term chartered Dragon class ships and four
VLEC vessels, together with the expanded gas storage terminal in Rafnes, a deep water terminal near
Philadelphia and long-term supply contracts, provides us access to the attractive U.S. ethane market for our
gas-based cracker in Rafnes, Norway.

**Our Business Strategy**

In response to challenges resulting from the current macroeconomic environment and as part of our long-term

strategic aim, we have maintained and will continue to execute a strategy consisting of the following short- and long-term
elements. These are designed to help us improve our capital structure, leverage our key strengths and market
opportunities and ensure ongoing cash flow generation and growth:

      - **_Where and When Appropriate, and within the Confines of Our Capital Structure, to Pursue Long-term_**
**_Value-added Growth Opportunities. As a result of our lean corporate structure, we are able to maintain a_**
level of agility that few organizations our size are able to match. We have a highly disciplined evaluation
process and a detailed series of metrics by which we measure the value creation prospects of potential
projects. Opportunities for profitable growth are identified and vetted in an efficient, non-bureaucratic
format, which, in many cases, we believe enables us to establish a first-mover advantage. For example, we
continued to pursue opportunities to grow our assets in the U.S. through the expansion of our Chocolate
Bayou cracker in 2020, and, also in 2020, acquired the remaining 50% of the high-density polyethylene
plant at our Battleground site in Texas from Sasol Limited. Our O&P Europe business also has in place 15year supply and infrastructure agreements entered into in 2012 to access ethane feedstock from the United
States for use in its European cracker complexes. In 2020, we opened a new 420 kta linear alpha olefins
plant and, in 2022, we opened a new 120 kta poly alpha olefins plant, both at Chocolate Bayou, Texas. In
the summer of 2022, we began construction of our 1,450 kta ethane steam cracker for the production of
ethylene in Antwerp, Belgium. In addition, we are currently pursuing several other projects that we believe
provide opportunities for profitable growth. We are particularly focused on expanding our footprint in Asia
to further access the high demand growth of that region, which may take the form of joint ventures and
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. For example, in 2022, we acquired a 50% interest in the SECCO facility in China
and agreed to acquire a 50% stake in the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project, which is currently under
construction by SINOPEC, is expected to be on-stream by the end of 2023 and includes a new 500 kta
HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plant, in each case through an Unrestricted Subsidiary. In 2022, we
also agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals, which
will add more than 1,000 kta of capacity, including for cumene, phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and
bisphenol A, upon completion (expected in the first quarter of 2023).

      - **_Continue to Drive Sustainability as a Fundamental Part of Our Business._** We believe we are a leader in
driving sustainable practices across our industry as evidenced by our recent Sustainalytics rating which
placed us as 11th best (11th lowest risk) of 483 chemical companies so far assessed, and 3rd best out of 234
commodity chemical companies. Our sustainability strategy is to develop and safely manufacture the
products needed to address the evolving challenges of climate change, public health, resource scarcity,
urbanization and waste in a way which drives us all towards a net-zero emission economy by 2050 whilst
being profitable. We believe our Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (“HSSE”) performance is
industry leading. Our strategy is to continue to improve injury and environmental compliance ratings by
applying increasingly sophisticated methodologies, with the ultimate aim being to achieve zero accidents.
We seek to ensure that all employees receive appropriate training, thereby enabling them to effectively
contribute to HSSE performance and HSSE improvement processes. It is our policy to design our processes
and manufacture and distribute our products in a responsible manner so that our employees, customers, the
public and the environment are protected from all avoidable risks. Our businesses have put in place
roadmaps to lead the transition to a Net Zero Economy in our industry by no later than 2050, whilst
remaining profitable, and staying ahead of evolving regulations and legislation. Based on these roadmaps,
we are setting ambitious but achievable targets for 2030 which are in line with our 2050 commitment. For
example, as compared to 2019, our target is to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 33% on a
like-for-like basis by no later than 2030. This target is consistent with EU and other national targets. In the
near term, we are investing over €6 billion on projects which will reduce our emissions footprint. We are
also investing in new products and technologies to drive the industry to a circular economy in which
materials are re-used to the maximum extent, and no products, once used, enter the natural environment.
For example, we have committed to make all our products recyclable and, by 2025, to develop a range of
polyolefin products containing at least 50% recycled product. Overall, across wider INEOS (including
entities outside of the Group), we have committed to achieving 850kt of recycled or bio content in our
polymers by 2030, which, again is consistent with likely regulatory targets in Europe.


-----

      - **_Generate Cost Savings and Enhance Efficiency._** We have historically succeeded in reducing costs at our
acquired businesses by making rapid reductions in underlying fixed costs and implementing an efficient
corporate and management structure. We have achieved significant fixed cost reductions in businesses that
we have acquired, delivering on average a reduction of 22% of inherited fixed costs in the four-year period
post acquisition. Continuous improvements in the efficiency of our existing sites and opportunities for site
consolidation are key aspects of this strategy, as we seek to maintain upper quartile cost positions and
world-scale facilities across the majority of our operations. The control of fixed costs will continue to be a
key priority for our business.

      - **_Generate Strong Cash Flow._** We intend to continue our focus on cash flow generation by maximizing the
utilization of assets, leveraging existing resources, continuously improving working capital practices,
following disciplined and focused capital expenditure and cost reduction plans and optimizing where
possible our capital structure. This focus has allowed us to reduce our costs and improve our cash flow
management, such as the ability to implement lower levels of maintenance capital expenditure. We apply
the cash flows generated from these initiatives to help reduce our debt and to strategically invest in the
business.

      - **_Maximize Utilization of Assets._** As a low-cost focused producer, we believe in operating our facilities at
full capacity. We believe this allows us to maintain positive margins and cash flows, even during downturns
in industry cycles or customer demand, more readily than some of our competitors who have higher
production costs. We intend to achieve growth in production volume by improving utilization rates within
the defined availability of an asset, improving availability of an asset by minimizing planned and unplanned
facility downtime and improving capacity of an asset through de-bottlenecking projects. We have a strong
track record of improving utilization rates of acquired assets.

      - **_Maintain a Lean Corporate Structure and Incentivize Employees._** We intend to operate our business in a
manner that is consistent with the philosophy of our shareholders and maintain a simple and decentralized,
flat organizational structure that minimizes corporate bureaucracy, coupled with compensation
arrangements that incentivize our employees. We believe that a simple and decentralized organizational
structure is cost-effective and will allow each of our management teams the freedom to use their industry
knowledge to respond to market opportunities. We believe that we can increase the value of our business
when our employees share in the value they create. We have management and employee bonuses and
long-term incentive plans linked to the EBITDA before exceptionals performance and other factors of the
business in which they work.

      - **_Maximize Flexibility to Use Advantaged Feedstocks._** We remain focused on our strategy of acquiring
advantaged feedstock sources and improving our flexibility to use different feedstocks to take advantage of
changing market conditions. In 2017, we entered into an agreement to construct one of the largest butane
tanks in Europe. In 2019, our butane storage tank contract was signed to provide the largest ever built in
Europe. The tank came on stream in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium in October 2020 and allows us to import
butane from the United States (and from all over the world) to supply material to our naphtha crackers at
Köln. This project complements our contracts signed in 2012 and 2015 to source ethane directly from the
United States for our Rafnes cracker as well as our a new ethane import tank and new ethane furnace at our
Norwegian plant. The gas cracking flexibility has been enhanced further with expanded butane supply to
our cracker in Köln supported by four Rhine river barges, which were delivered in 2020 and 2021. We are
also committed to maintaining flexibility in feedstock while expanding our olefins capacity. For example,
our Chocolate Bayou plant predominantly uses liquid based natural gas as feedstock, but has the ability to
process naphtha and our Köln plant is capable of switching between naphtha and butane as a feedstock.
This enables us to manage our feedstock mix in line with changing market and economic conditions. To
further enhance our sourcing of advantaged feedstock, we began construction of a new ethane steam cracker
in Antwerp, Belgium, referred to as Project ONE, for the production of ethylene in the summer of 2022. We
believe it is the largest investment in the European chemicals industry for the past 20 years and we expect it
to be among the most environmentally-friendly of its kind.

**Business Segments**

Set forth below is a discussion of our business along the segment lines of Olefins & Polymers Europe, Olefins &

Polymers North America and Chemical Intermediates in the following areas: products, manufacturing, raw materials and

**Olefins and Polymers**

We operate two Olefins and Polymers (“O&P”) businesses: Olefins & Polymers Europe and Olefins &

Polymers North America. Set forth below is a general discussion of the products, manufacturing, research and intellectual
property, transportation and competition, followed by a more detailed review of the products, manufacturing, raw
materials and energy and customers and contracts, of our Olefins & Polymers Europe business and our Olefins &

(1) In Europe, we consume more ethylene than we produce, which allows us to operate our crackers in Europe at higher operating rates than the
industry average. In North America, the olefin crackers at our Chocolate Bayou facility manufacture substantially more ethylene than is
required by our polymers and derivatives units in the Gulf Coast region. As a result, we sell substantial amounts of the ethylene that we
produce to customers in the Gulf Coast region of the United States.

(2) In Europe and North America, we consume more propylene than we produce. Our propylene consumption is primarily related to the
production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, oxo alcohols, phenol and acrylonitrile.

(3) According to NexantECA, measured by average annual capacity, we are the second largest manufacturer of high density polyethylene in
Western Europe and the third largest manufacturer of linear low density polyethylene in Europe.

(4) The assets of INEOS Chemicals Grangemouth Limited and INEOS Commercial Services UK Limited were transferred out of IGH on
October 1, 2013 in connection with the Grangemouth Divestiture, and the Lavéra Divesture assets were transferred out of IGH on July 1,
2014. However for the estimation of market ranking for IGH their capacities have been included since these assets remain within the broader
INEOS family of companies and there has been no restriction to, or change in, the competitive dynamic that the assets exercise within the
European market as a part of the INEOS family of companies. Therefore in management’s view, it is helpful to consider the Grangemouth
and Lavéra assets in order to reflect the relative overall commercial strength of the INEOS family of companies, which is the same as that of
O&P Europe within IGH.

Set forth below is a description of the principal petrochemical products and their applications.

_Olefins and related products:_

_•_ **_Ethylene._** According to NexantECA, ethylene is the world’s most widely used petrochemical in terms of
volume, accounting for over one-third of the global production of primary petrochemicals. It is the key
building block used to produce a large number of higher value added chemicals, including polyethylene,
polyvinyl chloride via ethylene dichloride and styrene via ethylbenzene. Ethylene is a flammable gas and is
a primary olefin obtained in a cracking process, as described above. Because ethylene is a gas, it must be
transported either by pipeline or in the form of a highly pressurized and refrigerated liquid, which is
expensive.

While ethylene itself has no consumer applications, demand for ethylene is driven essentially by its use as
feedstock for various thermoplastics, including polyethylene and other polymer derivatives. Thermoplastics are
plastics that soften when heated and harden again when cooled. Aside from being the feedstock for


-----

polyethylene production, demand for ethylene is also driven by the manufacture of ethylene oxide and
derivatives, ethylene dichloride and ethyl benzene. These products are in turn used mainly in the production of
other thermoplastics: PET, PVC and polystyrene, respectively. According to NexantECA, the global market for
ethylene is forecast to grow at 3.1% per annum through 2027 versus forecast GDP growth of 3.0% during the
same period, driven by polyethylene applications such as high-density polyethylene and linear low-density
polyethylene.

- **_Propylene._** Propylene is a flammable gas which is derived as a co-product either of the refinery fluid
catalytic cracker process used to make gasoline or of the steam cracking process used to make ethylene.
More recently, propylene is also being produced from processes such as propane dehydrogenation and
metathesis. Propylene is an important feedstock for a significant number of industrial products and is the
main feedstock for polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Propylene is marginally easier to transport than
ethylene and may be shipped by pipeline, road, rail or ship.

Global propylene demand is driven essentially by its use as feedstock for various thermoplastics and by the level
of demand for propylene derivatives, particularly polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, oxo-alcohols,
cumene and acrylic acid. Growth in the demand for polypropylene has stemmed from the substitution of nonpolymers (paper, wood, glass and metal, etc.) for polypropylene due to its relative cost advantage and superior
performance. According to NexantECA, the global market for propylene is projected to grow at 3.4% per
annum through 2027, driven mainly by polypropylene demand.

- **_Butadiene._** Butadiene is a gas and is one of the co-products of the steam cracking process used to
manufacture ethylene and propylene. Butadiene is used primarily in the production of polymers, principally
synthetic rubbers such as styrene-butadiene rubber, which is used to make tires and other rubber products.
Other polymers made from butadiene include acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene and styrene-butadiene latex.
Butadiene is also used to make ethylidene norbornene monomer.

Butadiene demand is driven primarily by growth in consumption of synthetic rubber. According to
NexantECA, the global market for butadiene is projected to grow at an average of 2.7% per annum through
2027. Demand is tightly linked to the market for synthetic rubber, which is, in turn, mainly consumed in the
automotive sector.

- **_Benzene._** Benzene is used to produce a number of petrochemical intermediates, such as styrene, cumene
for phenol and acetone, cyclohexane and nitrobenzene. It is mainly produced from refinery processes or as
a co-product of steam cracker operations.

Styrene is the largest chemical outlet for benzene at around 49% of demand. The second largest outlet for
benzene, accounting for 20% of demand, is cumene, which is nearly all consumed in phenol production with
acetone formed as a co-product. For 2022, NexantECA estimated the global benzene demand to be 53.5 million
tons, with 69% being consumed in the production of ethylbenzene for the styrenics industry and cumene for the
phenolics industry. NexantECA forecasts an average global growth rate in demand of approximately 3.0% per
year in the 2022-2027 period.

- **_Polyethylene._** Polyethylene is the world’s most widely used thermoplastic and is made by the
polymerization of ethylene. Polyethylene is often classified by its density, because greater density
corresponds with greater material rigidity.

Film is the largest single use of global polyethylene production and the primary driver of demand, representing
approximately one half of worldwide polyethylene consumption. Film includes a myriad of end use
applications, from food packaging to trash bags, stretch films and shrink films. Blow molding and injection
molding are the next largest uses and are also important demand drivers. In the blow molded category, blow
molded bottles are the single largest end use. NexantECA forecasts an average global growth rate in demand of
approximately 3.3% per year in the 2022-2027 period.

- **_Polypropylene._** Polypropylene is the world’s second most widely used thermoplastic after polyethylene
and is among the fastest growing categories of thermoplastics. It is manufactured by the polymerization of
propylene. The rapid growth of polypropylene-based products reflects the superior cost and performance
characteristics of this material. As one of the industry’s most versatile polymers, polypropylene is
achieving a portion of its growth by displacing other polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.

According to NexantECA, the global polypropylene market is projected to grow at 3.6% per annum through
2027. NexantECA expects that the demand for polypropylene in Asia will continue to grow at higher rates than
North America and Europe, primarily as a result of growth in the Chinese market.

**_Manufacturing_**

Olefins are produced primarily by the steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In steam cracking, a gaseous

or liquid hydrocarbon feed, such as naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas or ethane, is diluted with steam and briefly heated in
a furnace without the presence of oxygen. Typically, the reaction temperature is very high, at around 850°C, but the
reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. In modern cracking furnaces, the reaction time is further reduced to
milliseconds, resulting in gas velocities faster than the speed of sound, to improve yield. After the cracking temperature
has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched to stop the reaction in a transfer line heat exchanger. The products
produced in the reaction depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio and on the cracking
temperature and furnace residence time.

Light hydrocarbon feeds, such as ethane, liquefied petroleum gas or light naphtha, yield product streams rich in

the lighter alkenes, including ethylene, propylene and butadiene. Heavier hydrocarbon feeds (full-range and heavy
naphthas, as well as other refinery products) yield some of these products too, but also yield products rich in aromatic
hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons suitable for inclusion in gasoline or fuel oil. Higher cracking temperatures (also referred
to as higher levels of “severity”) favor the production of ethylene and benzene, whereas lower cracking temperatures
(lower levels of “severity”) produce higher amounts of propylene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products.

Depending on feedstock, varying levels of ethylene, propylene and other by-products are achieved. Ethane

produces the most ethylene but the least propylene. Naphtha produces substantially less ethylene, roughly one-third of
that of ethane, but produces more propylene and significantly more by-products.

The main polyolefins are the thermoplastics, polyethylene and polypropylene, which are produced by the

polymerization of the olefin monomers ethylene and propylene, respectively. While the majority of polyethylene and
polypropylene are homopolymers (a combination of the same monomers), a growing proportion is copolymers (polymers
that are produced from a combination of two or more monomers).

Polyolefins are produced using a number of different technologies that are widely available, including one

high-pressure process and three low-pressure processes (Solution, Slurry and Gas Phase). All of the technologies are
constantly being adapted to improve product qualities and reduce production costs. For commodity products, produced
on modern scale technology, the cost structure of these technologies is similar. Increased cost structures for producing
specialty products are typically justified by premium margins.

The following is a summary of the four processes:

**_High-Pressure Process_**

This was the original process used to produce polyethylene and is still in use today. This process is a free radical

polymerization that does not require the use of a catalyst, operating at pressures above 1,000 and up to 3,500 bar and
temperatures from 150° to 340°C. Originally conducted in a high-pressure autoclave, current processes more commonly
use a tubular reactor. This process is used to produce low-density polyethylene, characterized by long-chain branching,
considerable flexibility and clarity. Because of the high-pressures involved, this process involves higher risk than
low-pressure processes and requires expensive and specialized equipment; consequently, fewer high-pressure processes
have been constructed in recent years.

**_Low-Pressure Processes_**

These processes typically operate below 200 bar and have lower capital intensity but require the aid of a

catalyst. In addition, it is common to add a comonomer (butene or hexene in the case of polyethylene, and ethylene in the
case of polypropylene) to tailor the resultant polymer properties.

      - **_Solution Process._** This process operates at temperatures above the melting point of the polyolefin (above
130°C for polyethylene and above 140°C for polypropylene) and employs metallocene or Ziegler-Natta
catalysts and a solvent to dissolve the growing polymer chains. This process is best suited to make
high-density polyethylene (having very few chain branches, and those branches that do exist are short—
only a few carbon atoms in length) and linear low-density polyethylene (having many short-chain branches,
which may be contrasted to low-density polyethylene with many long-chain branches). Solution processes
have the ability to produce narrow molecular weight distribution polyolefins.

      - **_Slurry (or Suspension) Process._** This process is a continuous low temperature (60°-105°C, 20-35 bar for
polyethylene or 60°-85°C, 35-50 bar for polypropylene) process in which polymer forms as a solid particle
in the presence of a catalyst while suspended in a liquid slurry. In the case of polyethylene, the
polymerization takes place in an inert liquid carrier such as isobutane. In the case of polypropylene, the


-----

polymerization takes place in liquid hexane, heptane, or even liquid propylene monomer. When propylene
is utilized as the carrier liquid, the process is often referred to as “bulk slurry.” The carrier liquid serves to
aid in the removal of heat as it carries the growing polymer particles through the reaction process. The
catalyst may be chromium on silica (polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. The reactor may be
a stirred tank or a pipe-loop reactor, in either case jacketed to aid in removal of the heat of reaction. One or
more reactors may be placed in series to broaden the molecular weight distribution and produce bimodal
polyolefins. This process is best suited to making high-density polyethylene and homopolymer
polypropylene. One advantage of this process over other high-density polyethylene processes is the ability
to make rapid grade transitions, which makes it particularly well suited to the manufacture of specialty
polyethylene products.

      - **_Gas Phase._** As the name implies, polymerization occurs with the solid polymer particles produced on a
heterogeneous catalyst in the gas phase. Like the slurry process, the catalyst may be chromium on silica
(polyethylene only), Ziegler-Natta, or metallocene. In the reactor, the growing polyolefin particles are
fluidized and cooled by the gaseous reactants and/or nitrogen, or sub-fluidized and mechanically agitated.
Liquid monomer may be added and flashed to aid in the removal of heat. The reaction takes place at low
temperature (80°-100°C for polyethylene and about 60°-85°C for polypropylene) and pressure (15-35 bar).
A gas phase process has advantages over slurry and solution processes in that the heat of reaction is very
effectively removed and operates with lower hydrocarbon inventories. In addition, high-ethylene content
copolymers of polypropylene can be produced in this process. This process is best suited to the manufacture
of linear low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene and all types of polypropylene, including
homopolymer, random copolymer, impact copolymer and soft thermoplastic polyolefin.

Post polymerization, any catalyst is deactivated, the polyolefin is freed of any solvent, unreacted monomer or

liquid diluent, and the resulting polyolefin flake or crumb is combined with additives and extruded into pellets prior to
sale to downstream fabricators.

Several of these technologies have recently been adapted to run multiple reactions in series, yielding a product

with a wider bi-modal molecular weight distribution that provides superior strength or unique characteristics such as
high-impact resistance.

**_Research and Intellectual Property_**

Our olefins and polymers businesses are supported by technology centers in Houston (United States), Brussels

(Belgium), Rosignano (Italy) and Lavéra (France), which in turn support the following highly proprietary process
technologies that we believe together form one of the most competitive technology platforms available in the olefins and
polymers industry.

      - _Gas phase polypropylene technology._ Our gas phase polypropylene technology enables the cost-effective
production of high-performance polypropylene plastics.

      - _High-density polyethylene technology._ We own specialized technology for the manufacture of
high-density polyethylene that is characterized by low capital investments and low operating costs and is
particularly well-adapted to the manufacture of high-performance materials such as high-pressure pipe, one
of the fastest growing segments of the high-density polyethylene market.

      - _Gas phase polyethylene technology._ This technology is designed to serve the linear low-density
polyethylene and high-density polyethylene markets, which are the fastest growing segments of the
commodity polyethylene markets. The technology is characterized by low capital investment, low operating
cost, low emissions and waste, and no requirement for the use of additional solvents.

Historically, the Group has sold over 75 licenses to third parties across the three technologies. However, the

Group no longer sells licenses, and instead focuses on development of advantaged products for the Group’s different
polymers businesses.

We continue to manufacture and sell polyolefin catalysts to third parties. Management believes that the

polyolefin catalyst business is complementary to the polyolefins business, and does not adversely affect INEOS’s
competitive position in its polyolefin markets. The catalyst business is managed within the Olefins and Polymers
business in Europe and has grown significantly over the last four years.


-----

**_Transportation_**

We have access to a comprehensive transportation network and associated logistics infrastructure through a

combination of ownership and long-term contracts. We believe that this network enables us to move feedstocks and
products at competitive rates and provides us with access to the merchant market, enabling us to manage demand and
supply imbalances across the petrochemical value chain in response to market conditions.

Because pipelines are the most efficient and least expensive mode of transportation, we consider them to be of

strategic importance. We own some of the pipelines we use, while others are consortium-owned pipelines in which we
hold a stake or are provided to us by dedicated operators under long-term contracts. Other pipelines in Europe may be
accessed without a contract as long as the appropriate tariff is paid.

Where we are reliant on access to shipping channels, we either own or hold stakes in the relevant terminals and

storage facilities or have secured access to them through long-term contracts. We own several dedicated barges and also
utilize an extensive network of third- party shipping companies which make capacity available to us on a spot- or termcontract basis that is managed by our own in-house Marine Assurance Service.

**_Competition_**

We face intense competition in the olefins and polymers markets in which we compete. Given that most of the

products are commodities, the main competitive criterion is price. In certain segments of the polyethylene and
polypropylene markets, where products must satisfy specified technical performance criteria, competition is also based
on performance, quality and customer service. A key competitive factor is the ability to manage costs successfully, which
requires management focus on reducing unit costs and improving efficiency. The main drivers in this respect include
technology, scale, feedstock access, asset utilization, logistics and the ability to execute capital projects efficiently.

Because polymers are easily transported in bulk shipping containers or rail cars, there is significant trade

between regions. Globally we compete against a large number of polymer companies, many of which have capacity in
multiple regions and who market their products in Europe, Asia and North America. Our competitors include Lyondell
Basell, Sabic, Dow and ExxonMobil.

**_Products_**

In our olefins business, we manufacture ethylene, propylene, butadiene, raffinate 1, benzene, toluene and

gasoline blending components. The majority of our ethylene and propylene is either used for polyolefins production or
sold to other INEOS businesses as feedstock. Our butadiene, raffinate 1, benzene, toluene and gasoline blending
components are sold to other INEOS businesses as well as other producers of synthetic rubber, ABS plastics, oligomers,
cumene, styrene and polyurethanes and are traded on the open markets. Olefins & Polymers Europe is one of the largest
olefin and polyolefin producers in Europe.

In our polymers business we manufacture High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Low-Density Polyethylene


-----

(LDPE), Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and Polypropylene (PP).

In HDPE we are active in car fuel tank, milk bottle, high performance pipe and blow moulding applications,

most of which require lengthy customer approval processes. Sales from our HDPE asset have grown significantly since
2013.

Our low-density polyethylene products are particularly well-suited to specialty applications in the wire and

cable, medical and coatings sectors which also require lengthy customer approval processes. Our coating customers form
the backbone of our LDPE business and we also have a significant volume of medical product sales and other specialty
grades which generate high margins.

Our linear low-density polyethylene production is primarily sold to customers in the film sector, and, thanks to

the use of our proprietary metallocene technology, we have sales of both commodity and specialty grades into film
applications like super-tough and sealable films.

In polypropylene our focus has been in high modulus pipe and related applications, highly reinforced impact

copolymers for injection moulding, medical and heat sealable BOPP films, where we have a strong global position in
sealant material.

**_Manufacturing_**

Olefins & Polymers Europe operates large integrated olefins cracker and polymer sites with a total capacity of

5,050 kta for the production of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene, polyethylene and polypropylene. We own and
operate a large naphtha cracker complex in Köln, Germany, and a large gas cracker in Rafnes, Norway. Until the end of
2015, the gas cracker at Rafnes, received all of its feedstock from gas sources in the North Sea but from 2016 the
majority of Rafnes feedstock is ethane sourced from U.S. shale gas fields. The naphtha cracker complex at Köln includes
two naphtha crackers and a small integrated ethane cracker which consumes ethane produced by the naphtha crackers.
The naphtha crackers are also able to consume butane as part of their feed-slate and this flexibility enables the
management of feedstock mix in response to changes in economic and market conditions, resulting in the maximization
of margins. Both of these cracker sites are either co-located with, or connected by pipeline to, polyolefin plants and to
other olefin-derivative units, with market leading economies of scale and operational optionality that permits us to
maximise our margins across a broad portfolio of olefin-derivatives.

The cracker complex in Köln, Germany, benefits from being located in the center of one of the key industrial

clusters of Germany, whilst also being able to access feedstocks by pipeline and barge from the Antwerp and Rotterdam
area in the Netherlands; one of the world’s most competitive naphtha supply regions. It is the third largest cracker
complex in Europe, and the largest in Germany. With a proven track record of operational excellence, this very reliable
asset benefits from considerable downstream integration with a wide portfolio of olefin derivatives on- and off-site,
including polyethylene, ethylene oxide, nitriles, oligomers, ABS engineering plastic and synthetic rubber. It can also sell
its excess ethylene and propylene to the merchant market via pipelines and the site can also sell propylene by barge using
its own jetties on the river Rhine and by rail. In particular, the Köln site is connected to Europe’s largest ethylene pipeline
network owned by ARG, a company jointly owned by INEOS and four other European petrochemical companies.

The Noretyl gas cracker in Rafnes has been modernized and expanded to its present annual capacity of 645,000

tonnes of ethylene in 2016. It is also co-located with on-site derivatives assets, namely O&P Europe’s LDPE plant and
EDC/VCM plants owned by INOVYN, a related company. In addition, the cracker is connected to dedicated, wholly
owned ethylene liquefaction and export terminals from which it exports products to INEOS derivatives and the merchant
market in North West Europe.

While our two standalone polyethylene and polypropylene sites in Lillo and Geel in Belgium are not co-located

on cracker sites, they are connected to major olefin pipelines. Our Lillo site also benefits from connection to INEOS’
ethylene terminal, which is Europe’s largest, at the INEOS Oxide site in Zwijndrecht, Antwerp and indirectly with the
greater ARG pipeline. In both cases, this infrastructure provides these facilities with flexibility in sourcing feedstock.
Both of these sites benefit from easy access to large polyolefin markets.

Since acquiring Olefins & Polymers Europe, we have undertaken a significant improvement and restructuring

program across our assets to enhance their long-term cost-competitiveness. In general, cost efficiencies have been
substantially improved across all aspects of the business. The asset base has also been added to via the acquisition in
2007 of a 50% share in the Noretyl gas cracker at Rafnes and full ownership of the associated polyolefins at Bamble in
Norway. On July 1, 2015, we acquired the other 50% share in the Noretyl gas cracker from INOVYN, a related party.

Significant investments have been made to enhance our assets’ capabilities, including the building of a swing

furnace on the Köln cracker and the conversion of its linear low density polyethylene unit to highly differentiated


-----

metallocene production (a proprietary catalyst technology that permits the production of super-tough film grades). A key
improvement theme of our polyolefins business has been to creep capacities and reduce plant costs. We aim to run our
downstream assets as close to their maximum capacity as is operationally prudent while seeking to constantly improve
the sales portfolio by focusing on products that can command sustainably higher margins in bottom of cycle conditions
over commodity grades, which we refer to as “differentiated” products. We take advantage of our proprietary process
technologies, such as at Lillo (Innovene S), at Geel (Innovene P) and at Köln (Innovene G). These state of the art
advanced technologies allow us to manufacture distinctive resins.

The most substantial recent investment that was made in our assets was in 2015 at Rafnes, with the completion

of a new ethane import tank and new ethane furnace. These investments were timed to coincide with the commission of
NGL/LPG export facilities in the U.S. through which we have secured long-term, advantaged U.S. gas feedstock,
associated with the shale oil and gas developments in that country. This new source of ethane complements our existing
local sources of feedstocks. In 2020, the butane tank in Antwerp was completed which, along with dedicated barges,
allows the Köln cracker to increase the proportion of butane used in its feedstock thereby increasing the feedstock
flexibility.

Our manufacturing facilities are periodically shut down for scheduled turnarounds, to carry out necessary

inspections, testing to comply with industry regulations and any maintenance activities that may be necessary. Olefins
crackers typically undergo major turnarounds every five to six years, with each turnaround lasting four to six weeks. Our
Rafnes gas cracker is on a seven to nine year turnaround cycle. Polymers units are subject to more frequent maintenance
shutdowns, typically one turnaround every one or two years, but in this case each turnaround lasts only seven to 10 days.
A significant focus in prior years was placed on enhancing process safety and further improving reliability by initiating a
series of process safety audits and reliability reviews to give assurance about the adequacy of our critical safety
management systems and that the necessary plans are in place to drive very high levels of reliability.

**_Raw Materials and Energy_**

The primary feedstocks for our olefin crackers are naphtha and natural gas liquids, namely ethane, propane and

butane. The use of naphtha results in the production of a significant amount of co-products such as propylene, butadiene
and benzene, as well as Raffinate 1 and gasoline blending components. The use of natural gas liquids results in the
production of a smaller amount of these co-products. From 2016, our Köln naphtha requirements have been sourced from
several external suppliers under contract, with the balance being purchased in the open market.

We continue to look for sources of attractive feedstock and in 2012 we announced the completion of supply and

infrastructure agreements that secured a significant volume of ethane feedstock from the U.S. for use in our Norwegian
cracker. Since then, further ethane and LPG supply agreements have been secured from these advantaged U.S. shale gas
sources to complement our existing local sources. In addition, a new infrastructure contract was signed in 2015 which
allowed us to export feedstocks from the new Enterprise facility at Morgan’s Point on the Texas coast. Contracts for
eight “Dragon” vessels to transport these feedstocks to Europe were signed in 2013, with all ships having now been
delivered and fully operational. Contracts for two “VLEC” vessels (cargo capacity approximately three times larger than
the “Dragons”) to transport feedstocks around the world were signed in 2017, with them both delivered and fully
operational. The first shipment using these vessels took place in 2019 with supply of U.S. ethane to China being the main
activity.

The first shipment of ethane from the Marcus Hook Facility in Pennsylvania was exported from the U.S. in

March 2016 on the JS INEOS Intrepid, and the first ethane cargo from Morgan’s Point was exported in September 2016
on the JS INEOS Insight.

Although energy is generated at several of our sites, including as part of petrochemical manufacturing processes,

we are a significant net purchaser of both electricity and gas. In the past we have typically procured our requirements
from local producers or utilities at local market prices; however, we are increasingly moving to a more integrated process
to take more advantage of our scale and changing energy markets across the wider INEOS Group, including our ultimate
parent company and its other subsidiaries.

**_Customers and Contracts_**

In total, we had approximately 911 customers worldwide during the twelve-month period ended September 30,

2022, who are serviced by an in-house team of business, sales and technical service personnel. Customers of our olefins
business tend to be major European petrochemical companies, who use our products to make a wide range of polymers,
synthetic rubber, intermediates and specialty chemicals. In our downstream business we sell to a large number of
companies in a variety of plastic conversion industries involving rigid and flexible packaging, pipe, car fuel systems,
rotomoulding, wire and cable, medical and other industrial and consumer products. In Olefins & Polymers Europe as a
whole, in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2022, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our


-----

annual revenues and our top 10 customers accounted for less than 37% of our annual revenues.

In our olefins business the majority of our ethylene, propylene, raffinate 1 and benzene production is sold to

other INEOS olefin-derivative businesses at market-related transfer prices. For the twelve-month period ended
September 30, 2022, approximately 67% of the olefin requirements of our downstream polyolefin business was satisfied
by internal supply from our own crackers, while the rest was sourced from the open market. Our remaining production of
ethylene, propylene, butadiene, raffinate 1, benzene, toluene and gasoline blends are sold directly to customers
predominately via contracts of one to three years duration, with pricing either freely negotiated, cost-plus or
market-referenced such as ICIS or Platts. Product pricing can therefore change daily or monthly.

In our polymers business sales are mainly conducted under contract. The majority of these contracts are annual

with longer durations by exception. Pricing in these contracts is cost-plus or based on market references, such as ICIS or
Platts, or negotiated on a monthly basis.

In April 2020, our polymer business announced a collaboration with Plastic Energy on the construction of a new

plant to convert waste plastic into the raw material to make new plastic. Advanced recycling technology converts waste
plastic back to its basic molecules. The resulting material is then used in INEOS crackers to replace traditional raw
materials derived from oil.

In July 2022, we announced our joining the Digital Watermarks Initiative HolyGrail 2.0 (an initiative driven by

AIM – European Brands Association and powered by the Alliance to End Plastic Waste) to significantly improve the
sorting and recycling of plastic packaging waste. The initiative aims to address and improve how plastic waste is sorted
into different types, making the recycling of household plastic waste far more efficient. Although plastic packaging
collection rates are improving across Europe, challenges in sorting mean that recycled plastics are often a mix of types
and grades, making the recycled product difficult for plastics converters to reuse. Digital watermarks are imperceptible
codes which cover the surface of the packaging. They are around the size of a postage stamp, imperceptible to the human
eye, but detectable by special cameras linked to high speed waste sorting systems.

**_Products_**

Our olefin products—ethylene, propylene, butadiene, mixed butenes, and crude benzene—are the basic building

blocks for a vast family of petrochemicals produced by our chemical manufacturing customers. A significant portion of
our olefin output serves as feedstock for our polymers production, while the remaining output is sold to affiliates and
third parties.

The type of polyethylene we currently manufacture in Olefins & Polymers North America is slurry loop

high-density polyethylene. Our high-density polyethylene products are sold to customers for use in manufacturing food
packaging, household chemical containers, pipe, injection-molded products such as caps and closures, and crates and
pails. Our polypropylene is transformed into crates and trays, roofing membranes, food packaging, carpets, automotive
products, DVD cases, rope and toys. During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, consumables such as
caps, closures, film and packaging represented a majority of our polymer sales volume.


-----

Along with Olefins and Polyethylene, Polypropylene is a major product, with manufacturing lines at the

Chocolate Bayou, Battleground and Carson manufacturing facilities. Polypropylene is produced with a combination of
produced raw materials (Propylene from the Olefins crackers) as well as third-party purchased propylene. Polypropylene
is then shipped by rail and truck to various end-users in North America and abroad.

O&P North America also manufactures polyethylene pipe through our subsidiary, WL Plastics. WL Plastics is

solidly positioned as a leader in the North American plastic pipe industry. WL Plastics is a leading manufacturer and
distributor of HDPE tubular products for fluid and material transfer applications primarily for energy and industrial
infrastructure applications with a deep product mix of pipe diameters of [1]/2 inch to 54 inches.

O&P North America is a fully integrated business from the production of hydrocarbons through to fabrication of

polyethylene pipes.

**_Manufacturing_**

The key assets of Olefins & Polymers North America include the following:

      - the Chocolate Bayou, Texas, facility, one of the largest cracker installations in North America as well as
two on-site polypropylene units (PP3 & PP4);

      - the Battleground, Texas, facility, one of the largest North American high-density polyethylene facilities and
integrated with the Chocolate Bayou site through a company-owned pipeline system as well as the BMC
Line 3 polypropylene unit;

      - a 50% joint venture in the Horizon high-density polyethylene plant located at Chevron Phillips’ Cedar
Bayou, Texas, site;

      - the Carson polypropylene plant—integrated with the Marathon refinery at Carson, California;

      - the Hobbs fractionation unit, which can process 1,455 kta of natural gas liquids feedstock for our Chocolate
Bayou cracker;

      - the Gemini joint venture, for most of 2020 was a 50/50 JV with Sasol Limited, and represented a
world-scale polyethylene line at the Battleground manufacturing facility on the Houston ship channel that
started up at the end of 2017. However, as of December 31, 2020, Sasol’s 50% share was purchased by the
Group and is now a wholly owned Unrestricted Subsidiary; and

      - the WL Plastics fabrication and distribution locations include Mills, Wyoming; Rapid City, South Dakota;
Cedar City, Utah; Elizabethtown, Kentucky; Statesboro, Georgia; Snyder, Bowie and Lubbock, Texas; and,
as of January 2022, Titusville, Pennsylvania, an asset acquisition from Charter Plastics with a production
capacity of 45 kta.

All of the olefins crackers are either co-located with, or connected by pipeline to, polymers units, enabling them

to realize economies of scale, improve their facilities’ energy management and minimize logistics costs.

In North America, our olefins and polymers business comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate

Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas. As of September 30, 2022, the Chocolate Bayou and Battleground facilities
(including the Gemini HDPE output) had total production volumes of approximately 4,336 kta inclusive of olefins,
polyethylene and polypropylene finished goods.

Chocolate Bayou is one of the largest cracker installations in the Gulf Coast region and, according to

NexantECA, is the fifth largest site by ethylene capacity in the United States. The site has access to cavern storage, rail
service, and approximately 500 miles of pipeline, either owned or leased by us. This allows integration to our polymer
assets and our Hobbs fractionation unit, and permits the site to place its surplus ethylene and other products either
directly in the local merchant market or in storage to bridge time lags between production and consumption. The scale of
the Chocolate Bayou crackers should also enable the leveraging of the facility’s infrastructure and workforce. Another
key strength of the facility is the crackers’ flexible design. While their main feedstock is natural gas liquid gas-based
feedstock, which is obtained from various sources, including a significant amount from our natural gas liquid fractionator
near Hobbs, New Mexico, the commodity markets and Marathon’s refinery in Texas City, Texas, the facility also has the
ability to process naphtha. This flexibility enables management of feedstock mix in response to changes in economic and
market conditions. All of our polymers facilities in North America are either connected with the Chocolate Bayou
crackers or are adjacent to facilities operated by third parties with whom we have feedstock arrangements.


-----

For our North American polymers business, our key facility is the site at Battleground, Texas, which hosts both

polypropylene and high-density polyethylene production. As of December 31, 2020, the previous 50/50 Gemini HDPE
joint venture between the Group and Sasol Limited was purchased and it became 100%-owned by the Group. Our
high-density polyethylene site is one of the largest high-density polyethylene complexes in North America. Battleground
is integrated with Chocolate Bayou by way of a pipeline system owned by INEOS. Complementing our Battleground
polymers production is our Carson polypropylene unit and our 50% ownership interest in the Cedar Bayou Horizon
high-density polyethylene line. The Horizon line, which is operated by Chevron Phillips, is one of the largest single
slurry loop high density polyethylene lines in North America.

**_Raw Materials and Energy_**

Our procurement efforts remain focused on expanding access to low cost materials, services and equipment and

creating independence from sole or limited sources of supply. We are connected via pipeline to multiple hydrocarbon
suppliers at Chocolate Bayou Works and Battleground Manufacturing Complex to ensure a secure supply at reasonable
costs.

We, together with our North American affiliates, have centralized the purchasing of energy, natural gas, rail

routes and propylene (including refinery-, chemical- and polymer-grades), providing scale, common voice in the market
and, in the case of propylene, flexibility to manage our supply and demand. Our olefins and polymers business primarily
uses naphtha and NGLs as the basic feedstocks for our olefins crackers.

Although most external feedstock supplies of the business are available from a variety of third parties, our

Carson polypropylene plant depends on raw materials from the Marathon refinery located on the same site. Most of the
petrochemical feedstocks purchased from Marathon are part of a long-term contractual agreement. In addition, a
substantial proportion of our feedstock requirements is also obtained on the commodity markets. We manage the
procurement and trading of our feedstocks internally.

Our U.S. ethylene production capacity exceeds our U.S. consumption. We thus sell ethylene on the merchant

market and to related parties through supply contracts and swaps with other petrochemical and refining companies. Our
propylene production is lower than consumption. To address this shortfall, we purchase propylene on the merchant
market through supply contracts and swaps with other petrochemical and refining companies.

Although energy is generated at several of our sites, including as part of petrochemical manufacturing processes,

we are a significant net purchaser of both electricity and gas. Typically, we procure our requirements from local
producers or utilities at local market prices.

**_Customers and Contracts_**

_INEOS Nitriles. Our main product in the nitriles sector is acrylonitrile. According to NexantECA, measured_

by expected average annual capacity for 2022, we are the largest manufacturer of acrylonitrile in the world. The
primary applications for acrylonitrile are acrylic fiber and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastics. We employ
safeguards to ensure the safe handling of Nitriles’ products including the use of specially designed railcars and pipelines
for transportation to nearby customers. We believe that our competitive position in the worldwide acrylonitrile market is
strengthened by our proprietary fluid bed acrylonitrile process and related catalysts.

In addition, the Nitriles business produces acetonitrile, hydrogen cyanide, acetone cyanohydrin, ammonium

sulphate and oxazole and also produces catalysts used in the manufacture of acrylonitrile. In 2019, the ammonia and
nitric acid business was transferred to INEOS Nitriles from INEOS Enterprises. Ammonia production finds major
application in the fertilizer industry, but in the case of INEOS Nitriles is used in the production of acrylonitrile, nylon and
other non-fertilizer applications. Nitric acid is similarly used in the fertilizer industry but for INEOS Nitriles is primarily
used in the manufacture of polyurethanes. In this highly competitive market, we benefit from an advantaged location
within our Köln integrated petrochemical site and supplying more than 80% of our customer volume directly by pipeline.

_INEOS Oligomers. According to NexantECA, we are the largest linear alpha olefins producer measured by_

average annual capacity for 2022. We also believe we are the largest producer of polyalpha olefins worldwide. As a “full
range” linear alpha olefins producer, we manufacture a broad range of co-produced linear alpha olefins and must manage
production levels consistent with our ability to utilize or sell the entire product slate. As different segments of the linear
alpha olefins market tend to grow at different rates, the business has developed a variety of internal and external outlets
for the key products, which allow the plants to operate with minimal constraints. Our unique technology does allow
some flexibility to adjust our product slate in order to emphasize certain linear alpha olefins products and de-emphasize
others as demand fluctuates. Linear alpha olefins are used primarily as comonomers in the production of polyethylene,
as feedstock in the production of poly alpha olefins, detergents and lubricant additives and as drilling fluids. Poly alpha
olefins are primarily used in synthetic motor oils, transmission fluids and other demanding lubricant applications such as
wind turbines.

Specialty Oligomers products are manufactured from crude C4 and C5 olefinic streams and are used as base

stock or intermediates in a variety of high margin applications such as the manufacture of tires, compressor oils,
agricultural chemicals, plastic additives, specialty chemicals, fragrances and cosmetics.

Our GasSpec™ specialty amines, which are high performance specialty chemical formulations, often patent

protected, are used to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from natural gas, various refinery streams, ethane
cracker feed gas, and ammonia, hydrogen, renewable diesel and renewable jet fuel production streams. GasSpec™
operates a fully equipped laboratory in Freeport, Texas, that provides comprehensive analytical support to our customers.

_INEOS Oxide. We manufacture ethylene and propylene oxide, from which we produce a range of derivatives_

including ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, EO and PO alkoxylates and glycol ethers. According to NexantECA, we are
the second largest producer of ethylene oxide and the largest producer of ethylene glycol in Western Europe as measured
by aggregate annual capacity for 2022. We are one of only two commercially viable producers of ethylidene norbornene
monomer (ENB) in the world.

Ethylene oxide is a highly reactive, flammable and toxic molecule. As a consequence, ethylene oxide

producers typically use a significant proportion of their ethylene oxide for captive production or sell it to third parties
located reasonably close to, or on, their ethylene oxide production sites. The majority of ethylene oxide produced in


-----

Western Europe is used for captive production and there are virtually no ethylene oxide imports into, or exports from,
Western Europe. INEOS Oxide uses its ethylene oxide production for the captive production of ethylene glycol,
ethylene oxide derivatives and sales to third parties on its sites in Antwerp and Köln.

Our ethylene oxide derivatives include ethanolamine, a broad range of alkoxylates, and glycol ethers. We own

and operate one of the world’s largest ethanolamine units and produce a family of molecules that are used in applications
such as agrochemicals, surfactants (used in personal care products and detergent formulations), cement additives, textile
chemicals, metal working fluids, electronics and pigments. We have four alkoxylate reactors based in Antwerp, which we
use to make a broad range of alkoxylates used in household detergents, herbicides, industrial cleaners, petroleum
production, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, synthetic lubricants and surface coating. We also operate one of Europe’s
largest glycol ether assets to produce a range of methyl, ethyl and butyl glycol ethers used as solvents in surface coatings
and inks, and as jet fuel de-icers.

We are one of only two commercially viable suppliers of ethylidene norbornene (ENB) monomer globally and

the only producer in Europe. Ethylidene norbornene monomer is used in the production of ethylene propylene diene
monomer (EPDM) rubber, a high performance rubber that is both wear and weather resistant and is increasingly used in
place of conventional rubbers in automobiles, roofing materials and household appliances.

Ethylene glycol is used primarily as a feedstock to produce polyethylene terephthalate for film, fiber and resin

and in a variety of other industrial applications including antifreeze/coolants for automotive vehicles.

NexantECA believes we have the largest ethyl acetate plant in Europe with the product being primarily used as

a solvent and diluent, favored because of its low cost, low toxicity and agreeable odor. For example, it is commonly
used to clean circuit boards and as nail varnish remover. Coffee beans and tea leaves are decaffeinated with this solvent.
It is also used in paints as an activator or hardener and is present in confectionery, perfumes and fruits.

_INEOS Phenol. According to NexantECA, measured by average annual capacity in 2022, we are the largest_

producer of phenol in the world. Our global manufacturing capacity is more than two times that of our closest competitor.
Phenol is a primary material for a large number of chemical products. In recent years, the use of phenol for the
production of bisphenol A, an intermediate product used to produce polycarbonate and epoxy resins, has increased
substantially and is now the largest phenol application. Polycarbonate is an engineering thermoplastic material which,
due to its superior optical qualities, structural strength and weight, has a wide range of uses, including; CDs and DVDs,
optic-fibers, optical lenses, bulletproof glass and other ballistic resistant materials, structural parts in cars and trucks and
housings for electrical household appliances and office equipment. Epoxy resins are used in a wide variety of
applications including coatings, adhesives and composite materials, such as carbon fiber.

Phenol is also combined with formaldehyde to produce phenolic resins, which represent the second largest

commercial use of phenol. Phenolic resins are used in a wide range of applications, including plywood and oriented
strand board, furniture, insulation materials, laminates, foundry molds and adhesives.

The next largest application for phenol is as the raw material for caprolactam and adipic acid for the production

of nylon intermediates. Major uses include engineering thermoplastics and synthetic fibers for clothing and carpeting.

Since phenol and acetone are produced together in a fixed ratio, we are also the largest producer of acetone in

the world with more than twice as much capacity as the next largest competitor. The largest commercial use of acetone is
for solvents, either through the use of acetone itself as a solvent or through the acetone-based production of solvents. The
second largest commercial use of acetone is the manufacture of methylmethacrylate. Methylmethacrylate is used to
manufacture polymethylmethacrylate resins, including acrylic sheets and compounds for molding and extrusion. Acrylic
sheets and compounds are used in a wide range of architectural and industrial applications, ranging from point of sale
retail displays to glazing and decorative light panels. The third major use of acetone is in the production of bisphenol A.

Alphamethylstyrene is formed as an intermediate product during the phenol and acetone production process. It

is used in heat resistant thermoplastics, tackifiers, coatings and antioxidants.

**_Manufacturing_**

INEOS Nitriles operates from three sites, two in the United States and one in Europe. Our Green Lake, Texas,

facility is one of the largest facilities for acrylonitrile and related products in the world. The second U.S. site is in Lima,
Ohio, and is an integrated nitriles complex, producing acrylonitrile and related products, with access to feedstock from an
adjacent refinery. Lima also manufactures acrylonitrile catalysts for other facilities on a global basis. In Europe, we
manufacture acrylonitrile, ammonia and nitric acid in Köln, Germany.


-----

INEOS Oligomers operates from five sites split across North America and Europe. Joffre, in Alberta, Canada

produces linear alpha olefins from low-cost ethylene derived from Canadian and North Dakota gas. The other North
American assets are located in Texas, United States. The LaPorte site manufactures poly alpha olefins starting from
certain cuts of linear alpha olefin. The high viscosity poly alpha olefins facility at La Porte is currently being expanded.
The Chocolate-Bayou site produces linear alpha olefins, primarily using ethylene supplied from the adjacent O&P
Chocolate-Bayou crackers. In addition, the new 120 kta poly alpha olefins plant at Chocolate Bayou, Texas, was
successfully commissioned during the second quarter of 2022 and is now the largest poly alpha olefins plant in the world.
In Europe, production of linear alpha olefins and poly alpha olefins occurs in Feluy, Belgium and specialty oligomers are
manufactured in Köln, Germany.

INEOS Oxide operates from four main sites, in Antwerp, Belgium; Plaquemine, Louisiana, United States; Köln,

Germany and Hull, United Kingdom. Our largest production facility is at the Antwerp complex in the second largest
European harbor- and second largest chemical region in the world. This site has direct or indirect connections to three
major ethylene pipelines linking it to most ethylene crackers in Northwest Europe as well as the only deep-sea terminal
for Ethylene not integrated in a cracker complex. It also has pipeline connections to pipelines for nitrogen, oxygen,
natural gas and ship/rail logistic capabilities for sourcing bulk feedstock of propylene oxide, butadiene, acetic acid and
alcohols. In addition, the site has its own jetty facility on the Schelde River which links it to the port of Antwerp and the
Amsterdam Rotterdam Antwerp (“ARA”) pipeline and with rail and road tanker loading facilities. We produce
ethanolamine at our Plaquemine plant located on the Mississippi/Gulf Coast of the United States. This is a prime location
for chemicals production due to advantaged access to feedstock and direct access to sea jetties and close proximity to our
customer base.

INEOS Phenol operates phenol and acetone plants at sites in Gladbeck, Germany; Antwerp, Belgium; and

Mobile, Alabama in the United States. All three sites use our own proprietary technology, which has significant
advantages in energy consumption and other factors over competing technologies. Our Gladbeck plant is located in the
industrial heartland of Germany known as the “Ruhrgebiet”. It receives its raw materials by pipeline from an INEOSowned cumene plant (Marl), as well as other suppliers, and the finished products go out by rail and truck with most
customers situated within a 100 kilometer radius. It is the largest single train unit in the world. According to NexantECA,
our Gladbeck site is the largest capacity phenol site in the world. Our Antwerp site is located in the Antwerp industrial
area with direct deepwater access. All of the cumene reaches the site via ship. The majority of the site’s end-products are
transported to customers by ship, with the balance being transported by road. Our Mobile, Alabama, United States, plant
is located on Mobile Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, close to several major consumers. All cumene is supplied via ship
mainly from an INEOS owned cumene plant (Pasadena, Texas) or from producers on the Gulf Coast or Asia. About half
of the phenol and acetone produced is transported via ship and barge while the balance goes out by rail and road. INEOS
Phenol operates two cumene plants at sites in Marl, Germany and Pasadena, Texas. In August 2022, the Group
announced that it had agreed to acquire the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols Singapore Ltd from Mitsui Chemicals for
a total gross consideration of $330.0 million, which is expected to be funded by cash on hand and to complete in the first
quarter of 2023. The acquisition comprises the entire asset base of Mitsui Phenols on Jurong Island, Singapore, which has
more than 1,000 ktpa of capacity, including cumene, phenol, acetone, alpha-methylstyrene and bisphenol A. The
acquisition is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2023. This acquisition will allow us to support our
global customers more effectively, developing new markets and relationships in Asia.

We manufacture catalysts for polyethylene, polypropylene and acrylonitrile, and have established toll

manufacturing arrangements for polypropylene catalysts and some polyethylene catalysts. Manufacturing facilities exist
in Lima, Ohio, United States (acrylonitrile catalysts), Sarralbe, France (polyethylene catalysts) and Dahej, India
(polyolefin catalysts).

**_Raw Materials and Energy_**

Acrylonitrile is manufactured from propylene, ammonia and air with the use of a special catalyst. Acrylonitrile

is toxic and flammable and, unless chemical stabilizers are added for storage and shipment, can undergo an explosive
chemical reaction. We employ safeguards to ensure the safe handling of nitriles, including the use of specially designed
railcars and pipelines for transportation to nearby customers. The key raw material for ammonia production is natural
gas. Natural gas is supplied from utility companies via pipeline from the German natural gas grid to the Köln plant to
manufacture ammonia.

Ethylene is the feedstock for the production of INEOS Oligomers’ range of linear alpha olefins (Hexene-1 to

C20+). At our Joffre plant in Alberta, Canada, ethylene is supplied from the neighboring, globally cost advantaged
ethane Nova cracker complex facility. Ethylene is secured through a long term supply agreement. In Europe, the Feluy
alpha olefin plant is supplied with ethylene from Antwerp by pipeline connected to the ARG and via the new INEOS
deep sea Antwerp terminal. Ethylene supply is secured through INEOS O&P toll agreements and spot purchases. The
new Chocolate Bayou alpha olefins plant is supplied with ethylene mainly from the adjacent INEOS O&P Chocolate
Bayou ethane crackers. INEOS Oligomers produces poly alpha olefins at the new Chocolate Bayou, TX plant and the


-----

Laporte, TX and Feluy plants using selective INEOS Oligomers supplied alpha olefins cuts. The INEOS Cracker
complex in Köln supplies raffinate 1 and crude C5 which is the feedstock for the C4 isoolefins/ isoparafins unit and the
isoamylene and cyclopentane units, respectively.

INEOS Oxide’s principal raw material is ethylene. Our supply flexibility is bolstered by access to or ownership

of major ethylene deep sea terminals connected to the ARA pipeline network. We have short and medium-term contracts
of one to five years that generally specify minimum and maximum volumes with several different suppliers. The cost of
our key feedstock ethylene supply is based on a discount to the current Northwestern European contract price.

Cumene, which is made from the combination of benzene and propylene, is INEOS Phenol’s main raw material.

INEOS owns cumene plants located in Marl, Germany, which is pipeline connected to the Gladbeck site and in Pasadena,
Texas in the United States. We acquire the remaining cumene from our suppliers pursuant to four different types of
contractual arrangements. Under a toll contract, we supply the benzene and propylene required for the production of
cumene to our suppliers, who then convert these inputs into cumene. For this service, we are charged a conversion and
capacity reservation fee reflecting the supplier’s costs and a margin. Under the second type of contractual arrangement,
the suppliers charge us for cumene according to contractually agreed formulas based on benzene and propylene market
prices and agreed yield factors. A conversion fee is added to the charge. The third type of arrangement is the toll contract,
discussed above, pursuant to which customers pay for or provide raw materials to us and receive, in exchange for a toll
fee, corresponding phenol and acetone outputs in fixed proportions. Finally, we also make some incidental purchases of
cumene in the open market. As a result of these arrangements, we are exposed to changes in the market contract and spot
rates for benzene and propylene. We believe that our use of toll contracts with customers and formula-based contracts
can reduce our exposure to raw material price fluctuations.

**_Customers and Contracts_**

INEOS Nitriles has approximately 80 acrylonitrile customers in more than 180 locations worldwide, with the

top 10 customers accounting for approximately 73% of revenue. Major acrylonitrile customers include Chi Mei, LG,
Lotte and Synthomer in Asia, SNF in the United States and INEOS Styrolution, Aksa and SNF in Europe. We are the
only acrylonitrile supplier to provide customers with the security of supply from capacity in the United States and in
Europe and we service all key regions of the world: United States, Europe and Asia (including the Indian subcontinent).
Ammonia products are predominantly sold to on site internal customers for the production of acrylonitrile (INEOS
Nitriles) and nitric acid (Covestro), but also supplied to external customers for a wide range of applications. Our catalyst
products are used internally in our acrylonitrile plants as well as sold to a select number of customers around the globe.

INEOS Oligomers has approximately 350 worldwide customers with its top 10 customers accounting for

approximately 42% of revenue. Major customers typically include large polyethylene and elastomer manufacturers, such
as Dow, Nova, KNC, Qicheng and LG and leading lubricant, detergents, and drilling fluid companies.

INEOS Oxide sells most of its products to leading chemical manufacturers, including Arkema, Arlanxeo, BASF,

Bayer, Covestro, Proctor & Gamble and Wilmar. The majority of our sales are made pursuant to short- and medium-term
market contracts of one to five years in duration. Under a long-term swap agreement entered into with Dow Chemical as
part of the ethanolamine and GasSpec™ gas treating amines acquisition in February 2001, we swap a significant
proportion of our ethylene glycol production from our Antwerp facilities for an equivalent volume of ethylene oxide
production from Dow Chemical’s ethylene oxide plant in Plaquemine. We generally determine the prices for our
chemicals on a monthly basis based on current market conditions, including raw material costs. Other than ethylene oxide
prices, which are based on the European market price, our prices are generally based on the international market price.

INEOS Phenol sells to most of the major phenol and acetone consumers globally, including Olin, Covestro,

Bakelite, Sabic, Evonik, Ascend, Fibrant,, Roehm, Count and Radici. We generate approximately 62% of our total sales
from our 10 largest customers with whom we have developed strong relationships over more than 50 years of doing
business. Many of our sales contracts include provisions whereby raw material price changes are passed through
automatically insulating our margins from volatile changes in raw material markets.

**_Research and Intellectual Property_**

Our Chemical Intermediates businesses are also supported by a range of technologies, and each business carries

out research and development to improve the different technology platforms, to enhance environmental performance and,
where appropriate, to develop novel products, applications, catalysts and additives.

A key technology platform is the proprietary fluid bed acrylonitrile process and related catalysts. We believe

that this technology is the leading nitriles manufacturing technology from a cost and operational performance
perspective. In order to sustain the competitiveness of the technology, we invest in the development and manufacture of


-----

improved catalysts. These are critical for achieving high product yields with high reliability whilst minimizing emissions
and environmental footprint.

Active management of our intellectual property rights allows us to preserve the advantages of the products we

sell and the technologies we use, and helps us to maximize the return on our investment in research and development. We
police our proprietary rights and enforce them against third party infringements or misappropriations. We own over 2,000
patents or patent applications, in the United States, Europe, China and various other commercially relevant regions. In
addition, we own a number of registered trademarks. Strict control of our proprietary confidential technical information
provides valuable complementary protection to our other intellectual property rights. In addition to our own intellectual
property, we are party to licensing and other agreements authorizing us to use and sub-license patents, trade secrets,
confidential technical information and related technology owned by third parties.

While we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property rights provides significant competitive advantages,

we do not regard our business as being materially dependent on any single patent, trademark, trade secret or agreement.

**_Competition_**

Although INEOS Nitriles competes with numerous manufacturers of acrylonitrile, we are the largest producer in

the world. In addition, we believe that a significant majority of the world’s acrylonitrile capacity is based on our process
technology. Our most significant competitor is Asahi Kasei Corporation, closely followed by SINOPEC. Other
competitors include Ascend and Cornerstone in North America and AnQore in Europe. In the global market for
ammonia, we face over 150 competitive production units located in 50 countries. Thirty of these units are within Western
Europe.

The main competitors for INEOS Oligomers in linear alpha olefins are Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Phillips and

Sasol Limited. For poly alpha olefins, major competitors include Chevron Phillips and Exxon Mobil.

The main competitors of INEOS Oxide in the ethylene glycol, antifreeze, ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide

derivatives markets are BASF, Shell and Dow Chemical, while those in acetate esters include Celanese, BASF and OQ.
Our main competitor in the ethylidene norbornene monomer merchant market is ENEOS (previously known as JX
Nippon Oil & Energy).

In Europe, the major competitors for INEOS Phenol are Cepsa, Novapex, Borealis and Versalis. In North

America, our major competitors are AdvanSix, Shell and Sabic.

**Refining Divestiture, Grangemouth Divestiture and Lavéra Divestiture**

**_The Refining Divestiture_**

On July 1, 2011, subsidiaries of Lux I disposed of (i) the Refining Business and the Entrepreneurial (Refining)

Business to joint ventures formed between PetroChina and INEOS Investments and (ii) the Infrastructure Entity to a joint
venture owned by INEOS Investments (50.0%) and the Refining Business JV (50.0%), herein referred to as the “Refining
Divestiture.” The disposal of the Refining Business, the Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business and the Infrastructure Entity
was principally a disposal of the Refining segment of the INEOS Group as reported on the financial statements of IGH.

The Refining Business and the Entrepreneurial (Refining) Business disposed of in connection with the Refining

Divestiture consist principally of the crude oil refining operations carried out at the refineries located at Grangemouth,
Scotland, and Lavéra, France, and related entrepreneurial activities. The Refining Divestiture also involved the transfer to
the Infrastructure Entity of certain related infrastructure assets (principally a power station in Grangemouth, Scotland,
and a terminal and other facilities). Following the Refining Divestiture, the INEOS Group and the Refining Business
share certain assets and will continue to rely on each other for certain goods and services, which include the purchase of
feedstock by the INEOS Group from the Refining Business JV, the sale by the INEOS Group of certain hydrocarbons to
the Refining Business JV and the provision of certain administrative services to each other (such as security, emergency
response, accounting, employee relations, procurement and site management). The Infrastructure Entity acquired the
related infrastructure assets and provides certain infrastructure goods and services (such as power and access to
terminals) to the INEOS Group and the Refining Business JV. The Infrastructure Entity was transferred by the INEOS
Group as part of the Refining Divestiture and is jointly owned by INEOS Investments and the Refining Business JV.
Upon the consummation of the Refining Divestiture, service and asset-sharing arrangements were executed to govern the
ongoing use of the shared infrastructure and services. The indemnification provisions include the INEOS Group giving
an uncapped non-time limited indemnity to the joint venture in respect of environmental liabilities not related to the
Refining Business.


-----

As a result of the Refining Divestiture and related transactions, on July 1, 2011, we received net cash proceeds

(after expenses and agreed completion adjustments) equal to €658.0 million and 400 Ordinary Shares in INEOS
Investments, subscribed for at an aggregate subscription price of $1.015 billion. Until December 2022, the INEOS Group
held these ordinary shares in INEOS Investments, and INEOS Investments was, until such date, consolidated into our
financial statements. The ordinary shares have the right to receive an amount equal to all amounts received by INEOS
Investments (net of a good faith estimate of its audit, company secretarial and other administrative expenses, as
determined by the directors of INEOS Investments) in respect of its investments, including its equity interest in the
Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs and the Infrastructure Entity, and INEOS Investments was obliged to distribute to the
INEOS Group, subject to applicable legal requirements, in the form of dividends or as a return of capital, all amounts
received by it in respect of such investments, less such audit, company secretarial and other administrative expenses. The
holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to, in priority to any payment to holders of any other class of shares,
$1.015 billion of the total capital returned to the voting shareholders. The ordinary shares were sold to an affiliate that is
not part of the Group in December 2022.

**_The Grangemouth Divestiture_**

On October 1, 2013, the Group completed the Grangemouth Divestiture which comprised the disposal of its

Grangemouth petrochemicals operations, including the assets and pension and other liabilities, to a newly created
subsidiary of INEOS Holdings AG, our indirect parent company. The Grangemouth Divestiture was implemented
pursuant to a restructuring designed to address concerns that the operations carried out by INEOS Commercial Services
UK Limited and INEOS Chemicals Grangemouth Limited at the Grangemouth site had been loss-making for the
previous four years, primarily due to a high fixed-costs base at the Grangemouth site and a decline in suitable feedstock
supplies. Accordingly, a survival plan was implemented to improve its cost base and to enable it to invest in new
infrastructure to import U.S. ethane to the Grangemouth site which will provide a low cost sustainable raw material
supply for the business.

The plan formulated for the survival of the Grangemouth operations required a significant investment. This

investment included investment in infrastructure necessary to allow the site to import ethane gas from the U.S., including
the construction of an import facility and ethane tank. These facilities were completed during 2016 and the first shipment
of ethane gas arrived from the U.S. into Grangemouth in September 2016. The investment was funded from the proceeds
of the issue by INEOS Grangemouth plc in August 2014 of €285 million 0.75% guaranteed notes due 2019 (the
“Guaranteed Notes”), which were guaranteed by the U.K. government’s Infrastructure Guarantee Scheme. In July 2019,
the €285 million of Guaranteed Notes were redeemed at maturity and replaced with a new €350 million bank facility for
the Grangemouth divested business. The new facility had a three-year term and comprises a €200 million term loan with
a €150 million revolving credit facility. The €200 million affiliate loan between IHL and INEOS Grangemouth plc was
cancelled at the time of executing the new refinancing. INEOS Grangemouth plc has re-registered as INEOS
Grangemouth Limited following the redemption of the Guaranteed Notes. In July 2020, the term of the €350 million
Grangemouth bank facility was extended for a further three years and matures in 2025.

The Grangemouth Chemicals business has delivered stronger financial performance from 2014 to 2020 than was

envisaged in the original business case for the survival plan. Acceleration of the site transformation plan, strong
chemicals markets and improvements in the operations of the site have all contributed to higher cash generation and an
improvement in the net debt position of the divested business compared to the original business case.

**_The Lavéra Divestiture_**

On July 1, 2014, our subsidiaries INEOS Group AG and INEOS Europe AG disposed of certain petrochemical

assets and business in France and Italy to a subsidiary of INEOS AG, a company wholly owned by our ultimate parent
INEOS Limited. The disposed businesses comprise a petrochemical business at the Lavéra site in France as well as
certain other business and assets in France and Italy that were formerly part of our European Olefins & Polymers
business unit (the disposed assets and business are together referred to as the “Lavéra businesses”). The total
consideration for the sale of the Lavéra businesses amounted to €200 million and was initially provided in the form of
vendor loans. As of December 31, 2015, all of the consideration was received by us in cash.

The disposal was part of a restructuring plan for the Lavéra businesses with the objective of improving the

reliability and cost base of the Lavéra site.

The acquiror of the Lavéra businesses is not part of the “Restricted Group” under our Senior Secured Term

Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures and as a result the Lavéra businesses are no longer subject to the covenants
and other obligations under our Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Existing Indentures. Further, the Lavéra
businesses will not be part of the “Restricted Group” under the Indenture governing the Notes and will consequently not
be subject to the covenants and the obligations contained therein.


-----

We continue to provide certain supporting services such as supply chain management, accounting or logistical

services to the Lavéra businesses following their disposal. Further, our subsidiary INEOS Europe AG entered into an
offtake agreement for ethylene oxide with an entity that is part of the Lavéra business. These services and agreements
with the Lavéra businesses are engaged in on an arm’s-length basis.

**_Contractual Arrangements with the Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs_**

To ensure that the companies in the INEOS Group retain access to the feedstocks provided by the Refining and

Entrepreneurial JVs, we have entered into several contractual arrangements with the Refining Business JV and the
Infrastructure Entity. Pursuant to these arrangements, the INEOS Group will retain access to the feedstocks that are
essential to the retained business segments, thereby contributing to the long-term viability, security and profitability of
our businesses.

Our Köln site within our Olefins & Polymers Europe business has entered into standard supply contracts buying

naphtha with the Refining and Entrepreneurial JVs on an arm’s-length basis.

Contracts have been put in place to ensure that the companies in the INEOS Group retain access to the naphtha

feedstock produced by the Refining Business JV at Grangemouth, following the separation of the Grangemouth
petrochemicals business from the INEOS Group in the Grangemouth Divestiture.

**_Contractual Arrangements with the Grangemouth Petrochemicals Business_**

To retain flexibility on polymer sales, and thus optimization of value for the INEOS Group businesses, the

polymer production at Grangemouth is sold to market through the INEOS Group Limited Risk Distributor companies
(“LRDs”). The proceeds (less an agreed sales margin) of the sale of polymer production at Grangemouth through the
LRD network are transferred back to INEOS Commercial Services UK Limited, one of the entities divested in the
Grangemouth Divestiture.

**_Contractual Arrangements with the Lavéra, Sarralbe & Rosignano Petrochemicals Business_**

Historically, the majority of naphtha feedstock produced by the Lavéra refinery has been consumed by the

petrochemicals business at Lavéra. Pursuant to the Lavéra Divestiture, contracts were executed in order to continue this
arrangement.

To retain flexibility on polymer sales, and thus optimization of value for the INEOS Group businesses, the

polymer production at Lavéra, Sarralbe and Rosignano is sold to market through the INEOS Group LRDs. The proceeds
of the sales through the LRD network sales are transferred back to INEOS Olefins S.A. (“IOSA”) less an agreed sales
margin. Prior to January 1, 2022, the contractual agreements were with INEOS Derivatives France Limited before being
transferred to IOSA under the same terms and conditions.

**Research and Technologies (“R&T”)**

We consider R&T to be a key contributor to both the short-term performance and the long-term growth of our

business.

Our R&T work has four principal objectives:

      - improve the environmental footprint of our products and processes, for example, by reducing greenhouse
gas (“GHG”) emissions, and enhanced recyclability;

      - minimize production costs with a view to increasing the margins that can be achieved in the manufacture
and sale of our products;

      - make better products in order to sustain or capture more margin or market share; and at the same time

      - reduce capital costs to minimize the investments necessary to meet demand.

A substantial portion of our R&T expenditure is dedicated to the continuous improvement of our processes and

products to reduce GHG emissions associated with our operations and increase the recyclability and recycled content of
our products. This R&T work is carried out by a combination of site based teams and centrally located specialists and
research teams in one of our R&T centers. R&T projects typically yield returns within one to five years. We protect our
process technologies and products by seeking patents or retaining them as trade secrets.


-----

We believe that the quality of our scientific staff is important to our success. Our R&T teams have

comprehensive expertise in a variety of areas, including catalysis, process development, product and material science,
modeling and project management. The project teams also possess the necessary commercial expertise to enable timely
implementation of innovations. We consistently aim to improve the effectiveness of our R&T efforts by targeting our
projects at the most valuable applications and using project management tools to monitor progress. To attract and retain
the best-qualified scientists and develop a high level of capability and competence in the key areas of processes, products
and operations, we offer our employees challenging development opportunities and a competitive compensation package
that is aligned with performance of the relevant business in both the short and long term.

We also draw on external resources to enhance the scope, depth and effectiveness of our internal R&T efforts.

We proactively seek mutually beneficial partnerships with third parties, including other petrochemical companies, new
technology companies, key customers, and leading universities.

**Facilities**

We currently lease the office space for our principal executive offices, which are located in Rolle, Switzerland.

We also lease administrative, technical and sales office space in various locations in the countries in which we operate.

Our production network comprises 33 manufacturing facilities in six countries throughout the world (excluding

the SECCO facilities in China, the Group’s 50% interest in which is held through an Unrestricted Subsidiary). The

full INEOS capacity is shown here. A Restricted Subsidiary of the Group is the operator of the HDPE plant and has the exclusive right to
supply Gemini with the required components necessary for the production of a specified quantity of the HDPE products and to take such
quantity of the HDPE products and, as compensation, pays a toll fee. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Gemini HDPE Term Loans.”

(7) A 50/50 joint venture with Chevron Phillips, operated by Chevron Phillips. The capacities shown are the INEOS share of the activities.

(8) INEOS Oligomers has 100% rights until 2036.

capacity of 4,200 kta of petrochemicals including ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, polystyrene,
acrylonitrile, butadiene, benzene and toluene. The Group expects to complete, through an Unrestricted Subsidiary,
another 50/50 joint venture with SINOPEC concerning the Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project, which is currently under
construction by SINOPEC, is expected to be on-stream by the end of 2023 and includes a new 500 kta HDPE (HighDensity Polyethylene) plant.

**_Project ONE_**

In addition to our existing facilities, we are currently developing a new large olefins plant in Antwerp, Belgium,

known as Project ONE. Project ONE consists of an ethane steam cracker with a nameplate capacity of approximately
1,450 kta and associated utilities, tankage and infrastructure. Project ONE will be fully integrated into the wider
European olefins logistics network and will address wider market needs, which may include demand from INEOS
derivative units across the region.

We believe that Project ONE is the largest investment to be made in the European chemical sector for the past

20 years and is expected to contribute to a reverse in the decline in the European chemical industry by supporting the
growth and development of INEOS’s European customers in the coming years. INEOS has secured long-term


-----

competitively priced ethane feedstock for Project ONE translating into a tangible and sustainable competitive advantage
for INEOS against its peers in Europe.

Project ONE is also important from a sustainability perspective. From the outset, it is expected to emit less than

half of the CO₂ of the current best-performing European plants for the same production. By switching from ethylene
sourced elsewhere to ethylene produced by Project ONE, we expect that INEOS’s customers will be able to reduce the
carbon footprint of their ethylene-based end products by more than two million tonnes per year. The project will strive to
achieve carbon neutrality which is expected to be enabled by, amongst others, the development of hydrogen and/or
carbon capture infrastructure in the local industrial area. Project ONE is targeting to be carbon neutral within 10 years of
start-up and is aligned with the EU taxonomy Regulation 2020/852 for sustainable activities (EU Taxonomy), more
specifically on substantial contribution to the ‘climate change mitigation’ objective.

Project ONE will be strategically located in the Port of Antwerp in Lillo’s existing industrial area with deep sea

access and already connected to major olefin pipelines in Northwest Europe. The project is expected to boost
employment in the Antwerp region and strengthen the position of the chemical industry as one of the key sectors of the
Belgian economy.

INEOS has selected Technip to provide the operating technology for the new ethane cracker. Latest estimates

suggest that the project will represent a capital investment of approximately €4 billion (of which approximately €1 billion
is expected to be invested in 2023) largely funded by debt secured on the Project ONE assets. See also “Description of
Other Indebtedness—Project ONE Facilities.” The final investment decision was made in Q1 2022. The environmental
permit from the Flanders authorities was received in, and was immediately effective from, June 2022, although it is
subject to on-going appeals before the Council for Permit Disputes in Flanders. With construction having begun on site in
the summer of 2022, the plant is anticipated to be completed in 2026 and create 450 direct jobs. See also “—Legal
Proceedings,” “Risk Factors—Future acquisitions or developments—Any future acquisitions or developments may prove
difficult for us to consummate” and “Risk Factors—Litigation—We are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed
by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business.”

**Health, Safety, Security and Environment**

**_Overview_**

Our facilities and operations are subject to a wide range of HSSE laws and regulations in all of the jurisdictions

in which we operate. These requirements govern, among other things, the manufacture, storage, handling, treatment,
transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, wastewater discharges, air emissions (including GHG
emissions), noise emissions, operation and closure of landfills, human health and safety, process safety and risk
management and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Many of our operations require permits and controls to monitor or
prevent pollution. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial ongoing capital and operating expenditures to
ensure compliance with current and future HSSE laws, regulations and permits or the enforcement of such requirements.
Our aggregate HSSE capital expenditures in 2020 and 2021 totalled approximately €300 million per year. Annual HSSE
capital expenditure for 2022 is expected to be similar.

Violations of HSSE requirements may result in substantial fines or penalties, the imposition of other civil or

criminal sanctions, cleanup costs, claims for personal injury, health or property damages, requirements to install
additional pollution control equipment, or restrictions on, or the suspension of, our operating permits or activities. At
certain sites where we operate, regulators have alleged or we have otherwise identified potential or actual
non-compliance with HSSE laws and/or the permits which authorize operations at these sites. Some of these allegations
or instances of non-compliance are ongoing, and substantial amounts may need to be spent to attain and/or maintain
compliance. In addition, we have in the past paid, and in the future may pay, penalties to resolve such matters. Our
businesses and facilities have experienced, and in certain cases, are in the process of investigating or remediating,
hazardous materials in the soil and groundwater at locations where we operate and/or adjacent properties and/or natural
resources at public and private lands not owned by us. We continually investigate and remediate contamination at certain
sites where our facilities dispose of hazardous wastes. In addition, HSSE laws and regulations can impose various
financial responsibility requirements on us, and pursuant to these requirements we may be required to post bonds, create
trust funds or provide other assurances that we will be able to address contamination at our sites and comply with our
decommissioning obligations once our facilities reach the end of their useful lives.

Other HSSE laws and regulations may impose restrictions upon product or raw material use, import or sale by

us or our customers. For example, it is possible that certain of our products or by-products or the raw materials we use
may, in the future, be classified as hazardous or harmful, which could impact our production or demand for our products
and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business and/or results of operations.


-----

We believe that our operations are nonetheless currently in material compliance with all HSSE laws, regulations

and permits. We actively address compliance issues in connection with our operations and properties and we believe that
we have systems in place to ensure that environmental costs and liabilities will not have a material adverse impact on us.
Nevertheless, estimates of future environmental costs and liabilities are inherently imprecise, and the imposition of
unanticipated costs or obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations in any period in which those costs are incurred.

**Major Regulatory Matters and Developments**

**_Air and Climate Change Regulations and Initiatives_**

_EU Emissions Trading System_

Our operations in Europe are covered by the European Union Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”), a

EU-wide trading system for industrial GHG emissions. Industrial sites receive or purchase allowances to emit GHGs and
must surrender one allowance for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Companies which emit less GHGs than their
allowances cover are able to sell the excess allowances, whereas those which emit more must buy additional allowances
through the EU ETS. The number of allowances to emit GHGs that are received by industrial facilities free of charge has
been, and we expect will continue to be, reduced over time. Accordingly, in the future, we may be required to purchase
more of the allowances we use, or to make emissions reductions at our facilities, which could cause us to incur additional
compliance and/or capital costs and/or adversely impact our production and our results of operations. In 2021, the value
of our utilized emissions allowances under the EU ETS totalled approximately €50.0 million, and future utilization
values are expected to be similar (or less) for 2022 and 2023.

On July 14, 2021, the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to make the EU’s climate, energy,

transport and taxation policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990
levels. Achieving these emission reductions will likely impact on INEOS operations in the EU requiring further
investments over this timeframe.

_EU Industrial Emissions Directive (IED)_

Our operations are also required to comply with the EU Industrial Emissions Directive (“IED”). The European

Commission regularly publishes new decisions aiming at reducing emissions to air and water from all chemical sites. We
actively participate in the process to discuss those regulations to defend our interests and better anticipate the need for
capital expenditures which could be required in order to comply with these new rules.

_U.S. Clean Air Act and Climate Change Regulations and Other Regions_

In the United States, the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) regulates air emissions from various sources and

requires, among other things, monitoring of specified pollutants, including hazardous air pollutants, stringent air emission
limits and technological controls to reduce emissions to air. Strict federal and state controls on ozone, carbon monoxide,
benzene, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other emitted substances impact our activities and increase our operational
costs in the United States. In August 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which defines
new air pollutants regulated under the CAA and increases the U.S. EPA’s budget across air pollution programs, further
enhancing its monitoring and enforcement capabilities.

Growing concern about the sources and impacts of global climate change has led to a number of legislative and

administrative measures, both proposed and enacted, to monitor, regulate and limit carbon dioxide and other GHG
emissions. For example, we are required to monitor and report to the U.S. EPA annual GHG emissions from certain of
our U.S. facilities. In addition, the U.S. EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA and other
existing legislation as comprehensive climate change legislation has not yet been enacted by the U.S. Congress. We
actively monitor state, regional, provincial and federal GHG initiatives and other regulatory developments in anticipation
of any potential impacts on or costs to our operations. As of January 2021, the U.S. re-joined the Paris Agreement. The
Paris Agreement’s metric for tracking emissions targets is country-specific “nationally determined contributions”
(“NDCs”). The agreement mandates NDC targets change every five years and reflect each country’s “highest possible
ambition.” NDCs are reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat and filed into
an official public registry. The U.S. Congress may consider comprehensive federal legislation regarding climate change,
and as a consequence, various regional initiatives regarding emissions associated with climate change are in effect or
proposed. Although we believe it is likely that GHG emissions will continue to be regulated in the U.S., and other
countries (in addition to the EU) in the future, we cannot yet predict the form any such additional regulation will take in
the chemical industry itself in various jurisdictions (such as a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax
or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, to estimate any costs that we may be required to incur, for example, to


-----

install emissions control equipment, purchase emission allowances or address other regulatory obligations. We continue
to monitor the situation closely.

In addition, the U.S. EPA has finalized or proposed several rules relating to emissions reporting and emissions

reductions. We monitor rules within our industrial sector and rules in other sectors that may set a precedent for ours.
Significant capital expenditures could be required for emissions control equipment in order to comply with these new
rules.

In the United States, stringent controls on nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and hydrocarbon “Volatile Organic

Compound” (“VOC”) emissions, and/or the need to purchase emissions credits for certain facilities, impact our
operations and, indirectly, the cost of our products. Credit pricing is subject to general economic conditions. NOx and
VOC credits have been available and affordable in the markets where we have previously needed such credits and have
not been a deciding factor in growth. There are expected state-specific NOx reduction rules in areas in which we operate
facilities that could affect availability and increase the cost of NOx credits. These expected state NOx reductions rules are
expected to also require installation of further NOx emissions controls within the next five years. The U.S. EPA has
finalized rules that will require states to restrict or prohibit emissions that “significantly contribute” to non-attainment of,
or interference with a state’s ability to maintain, the revised ozone standard in other “downwind” states. Both of these
developments may require additional NOx and VOC reductions at our facilities over the next decade, and could cause us
to incur additional compliance and/or capital costs and/or adversely impact our production and our results of operations.
Federal NOx reduction rules and provincial benzene reduction requirements are also expected in Canada that may require
emissions controls or emission credit purchases.

**_The Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation, the Classification, Labelling_**
**_and Packaging (“CLP”) Regulation, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Canadian Environmental Protection_**
**_Act, 1999 (“CEPA”)_**

The EU regulates chemical products within the European Union by imposing on all affected industries the

responsibility for ensuring and demonstrating the safe manufacture, use and disposal of chemicals. REACH requires the
registration of all chemicals manufactured and imported into the European Union (either alone, in mixtures or in articles)
with the European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”). The regulation requires formal documentation of the relevant data
required for hazard assessments for each substance registered as well as development of risk assessments for their
registered uses. Most uses of high hazard substances, such as carcinogens, will require authorization by the ECHA. We
manufacture, process, or use a number of substances classified as substances of very high concern under REACH. Some
of the intermediates and monomers manufactured within some of our businesses are classified as carcinogenic,
mutagenic, or reprotoxic. REACH requires extensive toxicological data, documentation and risk assessments for many of
our chemical products and raw materials. As a corollary to REACH, the European Union has also adopted the CLP
Regulation to harmonize the European Union’s system of classifying, labelling and packaging chemical substances with
the United Nation’s Globally Harmonized System. The regulation is expected to standardize communication of hazard
information of chemicals and to promote regulatory efficiency. It introduces new classification criteria, hazard symbols
and labeling phrases, while taking account of elements that are part of the current EU legislation.

In the United States and Canada, our products and raw materials are subject to environmental, health and

industrial hygiene regulations, including TSCA and CEPA, requiring the registration and safety analysis of the
substances contained in them. The U.S. Congress passed the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century
Act in 2016. The U.S. EPA is currently undergoing adoption of the amended TSCA regulations to comply with the new
law’s requirements. The full impact of these amendments to TSCA remains uncertain and it is possible that they could
trigger risk evaluations of certain of our products by the U.S. EPA, which may lead to new or more stringent regulatory
obligations and/or restrictions, up to and including prohibitions on manufacture and sale of certain products. On
December 19, 2016, the U.S. EPA published a list of 10 chemical substances that are the subject of the U.S. EPA’s initial
chemical risk evaluations, as required by TSCA. This list includes multiple chemicals we manufacture, including carbon
tetrachloride and methylene chloride. Work on the risk evaluations has already begun, following the mandatory
requirement for the U.S. EPA to evaluate existing chemicals with clear and enforceable deadlines.

Such regulations could result in a key raw material, chemical or other substance being classified or reclassified

as having a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment, users of our products, or our employees. Such
reclassification of one or more of our raw materials or products could affect its availability and marketability, result in a
ban on its purchase or sale, or require us to incur increased costs to comply with additional notification, labelling or
handling requirements.

**_Risk Management—Prevention of Major Accidents and Process Safety_**

Risks are inherent in the chemical and petrochemical businesses, particularly risks associated with safety, health

and the environment, and each of our facilities actively assesses and manages such risks as required by law. Within the


-----

European Union, an EU directive on the control of major accident hazards (the “Seveso III Directive”), regulates
facilities that present a risk of accidents involving dangerous substances and imposes specific plans and procedures on
them, particularly for the storage of such substances. The Seveso III Directive, which replaced the previous Seveso II
Directive on June 1, 2015, provides for control measures aimed at preventing and limiting the consequences of major
accidents. All of our major production sites are in the top tier of regulation under the Seveso III Directive due to the
quantity of dangerous substances stored at them. As such, we must establish a major accident prevention policy, safety
reporting system, safety management system and emergency plan compliant with the requirements of the Seveso III
Directive.

In the United States, our manufacturing facilities are subject to the U.S. EPA’s Risk Management Program

(“RMP”), which requires facilities that produce, handle, process, distribute or store certain highly hazardous chemicals to
develop a risk management plan and program in the event of an accidental release of such chemicals. RMP also requires
facilities to assess potential impacts to off-site populations in the event of a credible worst-case release and to document
the policies, procedures, equipment and work practices in place to mitigate identified risks. Similar risk management
requirements are imposed upon our facilities under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which
contains chemical emergency response planning, accident release and other reporting and notification requirements
applicable to our U.S. manufacturing facilities. The U.S. EPA finalized the change to the RMP regulations in 2016 that
became effective in September 2018 and some further changes were made in December 2019. While the changes impact
some RMP-covered sites, they are not significant enough to create a burden or increase costs for our facilities.

In addition, our U.S. facilities are subject to standards including the OSHA Process Safety Management

(“PSM”) standard, which requires development of a program to manage workplace risks associated with highly
hazardous chemicals. To better manage risks and process safety we pursue certifications within OSHA’s Voluntary
Protection Program (“VPP”), and our Battleground (Houston) and Chocolate Bayou sites are certified to Star status, the
highest level achievable. Star level means that the site has successfully implemented a safety and health management
system and achieved a combined injury and illness rate that is below the industry rate nationwide. In addition, many of
our U.S. sites also report PSM incidents as required by API 754 as part of the database maintained by the American Fuel
and Petrochemical Manufacturers association.

Programs employed to manage PSM risks include instrumentation and overpressure relief devices. Industry

standards such as ISA 84, an international standard that addresses the application of safety-instrumented systems for
process industries with IEC 61508/511 being the European equivalent, are used. Our pressure relief systems are reviewed
and designed to relevant legal (OSHA, ASME, NFPA, PED, ISO), industry (API, DIERS) and internal standards. In
addition, all of our businesses are aware that effective safety management is consciously required to address and deal
with major accident and process safety risks. We promote personal leadership for the management of these risks and the
Board of Directors for each business operates a “Letter of Assurance” process whereby each of the Operations
Directors/Site Managers reviews compliance with local regulations and the effectiveness of the safety management
system. They then formally inform their Executive Team and Chief Executive in writing about any issues about which
they need to be concerned. This process is intended to provide assurance that all businesses are in compliance in all
material respects with applicable health, safety and environmental laws in the countries in which they operate.

**_Environmental Remediation and Closure Liabilities_**

Many of our sites have an extended history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related activities, and

sites with known or suspected contamination exist. We are currently, and from time to time have been or may be,
required to investigate and remediate releases of hazardous materials or contamination at or migrating from certain of
these sites, as well as properties we formerly owned, leased or operated. We could also be responsible for investigating
and cleaning up contamination at off-site locations where our predecessors or we disposed of or arranged for the disposal
or treatment of hazardous wastes. Under some environmental laws, liability can be imposed regardless of whether the
owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the
contamination were legal at the time they occurred. In connection with contaminated properties, as well as our operations
generally, we also could be subject to claims by government authorities, individuals and other third parties seeking
damages for alleged personal injury or property damage resulting from hazardous substance contamination or exposure
caused by our operations, facilities or products.

Baseline surveys of soil and groundwater conditions were conducted at many of our sites in the European Union

in connection with obtaining our Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control permits, and such data was reported to the
relevant authorities. In addition, many of our other sites were the subject of intrusive investigations when they were
acquired by us or in connection with historical activities or operational changes over the years. The process of
investigation and remediation can be lengthy, varies from site to site and is subject to changing legal requirements and
developing technologies. We are not currently aware of any additional sites as to which material claims or clean-up
obligations exist. The discovery of previously unknown contamination, however, or the imposition of new obligations to
investigate or remediate contamination at our facilities, could result in substantial unanticipated costs. Additionally, if the


-----

U.S. EPA or other regulatory agencies (in the U.S. and other countries) adopt more stringent regulations pertaining to
PFAS in the environment, the Group may be required to incur significant cleanup costs. We could be required to
establish or substantially increase financial reserves for such obligations or liabilities and, if we fail to accurately predict
the amount or timing of such costs, the related impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in any
period in which those costs need to be incurred could be material.

**_Product Stewardship and Innovation_**

Many of our products have some hazardous properties, and some of them require specialized handling

procedures due to their acute and chronic toxicity. Our polymer products have widespread end uses in a variety of tightly
regulated consumer industries, including in food packaging and medical applications. To manage these risks, our product
stewardship team works closely with industry associations, government regulators and others to develop regulations,
which are based in science and are commensurate with the magnitude of the risk.

**_Security and Crisis Management_**

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) requires compliance by our facilities as defined in the

Marine Transportation Security Act (“MTSA”), the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards (“CFATS”) and U.S.
Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials regulations.

The DHS, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Administration and individual state emergency

management regulators require that all sites hosting emergency response teams train responders. It is required that the
emergency response teams and incident management teams have the knowledge, skills and equipment to allow them to
work in concert with local, state, and Federal agencies in a framework defined by the National Incident Management
System (“NIMS”). NIMS or equivalent training is conducted at sites to meet the intent of NIMS requirements. This
allows the site responders to join with the governmental group in cases of widespread emergencies, including pandemics,
where multiple agencies and organizations are involved.

**_HSSE Principles_**

We remain very strongly committed to excellent HSSE performance and believe we are a top decile performer

within the chemicals industry. In 2013, INEOS converted its safety performance monitoring to mirror the U.S. OSHA
standard. This enabled a common platform for comparisons and increased the number and types of injury data collected
and analyzed. Across the wider INEOS group, the OSHA rate for the combined INEOS and contractor workforce has
decreased in recent years from a high of 0.52 injuries per 200,000 hours in 2013 to only 0.18 in 2021 and 0.16 in 2022.
We strive to operate throughout the world with a commitment to doing what is needed to protect the environment and to
comply with all applicable regulations in the countries in which we operate. Our focus is on prevention of process safety
incidents and we have developed internal audit programs (20 HSSE principles) designed to monitor and correct any
deviations from acceptable performance.

Our aim is to avoid injuries to the community, employees and contractors. We focus on reducing major plant

losses of containment of chemicals with health and safety impact. Core to our HSSE standards is our HSSE policy, which
promotes executive management and individual responsibility, adherence to operating procedures and training and
requires our sites to be designed, operated and managed with the goal of preventing major incidents.

**Employees**

As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 7,300 employees (measured as full-time equivalents

(“FTEs”)) in our operations around the world, excluding employees of our joint ventures. Approximately 62% of these
employees were located in Europe, approximately 37% were located in North America and 1% was located in the rest of
the world.

Historically, we have enjoyed good labor relations and we are committed to maintaining these relationships.

Other than management and professional personnel, the majority of our employees are represented by local trade unions
and are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including a European Employee Forum agreement under the
European Council 94/45/EC, Article 6, which covers all European businesses and employees within INEOS Group and is
designed to provide a formal mechanism for management and employee representatives to communicate on significant or
potentially significant issues across the INEOS Group’s European operations.

We value the diversity of our people and each of our employees is recognized as an important member of our

team. Our goal is to attract a diverse range of the highest quality candidates for each available position, recruiting based
on merit following the principles of equal opportunity. In each of our locations, we directly recruit local talent into our
operations and business. These local opportunities are supplemented by group-wide initiatives such as our Core Graduate


-----

Engineering program and European Commercial Program (designed to attract high quality candidates who wish to pursue
a commercial rather than technical career). In addition, our requirements and behavioral expectations for employees and
businesses are outlined in our Code of Conduct which is regularly updated and communicated to all employees and
external stakeholders. The code comprises the following sections: Health, safety, security and the environment;
Competition and sanctions; Governance; Government and communities; Financial integrity and company assets; Human
resources; Digital system use and security; and Violations of the code.

**Insurance**

INEOS purchases insurance on an all risk basis, including business interruption (including consequential loss)

and property damage on a replacement cost basis. In addition, we purchase third party liability insurance, directors &
officers, marine cargo, protection & indemnity insurance and life insurance for all of our employees. We believe our
policies are in accordance with customary industry practices, including deductibles and coverage amounts. Our broker,
lead insurers and underwriters perform risk engineering surveys and routinely inspect all assets. We have an ongoing
program to regularly revalue our assets. The insurance replacement value of our assets for business interruption
(including consequential loss) and property damage is approximately €34 billion as of September 30, 2022.

**Legal proceedings**

As is the case with many companies in the chemical industry, we are and may from time to time become a party

to claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of our business. For example, appeals contesting our
environmental permit for Project ONE have been filed with the Council for Permit Disputes in Flanders, Belgium. We
cannot rule out that they will lead to the permit being revoked, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability
to successfully complete Project ONE within the anticipated timeframe or at all and meet our Group ESG targets and, if
revoked after significant expenditure has been incurred on the project, could have a material adverse effect on our
business. Except as otherwise disclosed in this offering memorandum, we are not currently involved in any legal or
arbitration proceedings that are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position and, to our
knowledge, no such legal or arbitration proceedings are currently threatened.

**Agreements with BP**

We have ongoing relationships with BP under several trading agreements as summarized below.

**_Reorganization Agreements_**

In connection with the separation of certain businesses that INEOS acquired from BP in December 2005, there

are certain reorganization arrangements in place with BP. The principal arrangement relates to access to the RMR
Pipeline. A significant portion of the annual naphtha supply required by the petrochemical cracker at our Köln, Germany
site is transported through the RMR pipeline. BP is entitled to a certain amount of RMR pipeline capacity every year,
consistent with its overall 35% interest in the pipeline. We have an arrangement with BP pursuant to which we have a
right to use a portion of this capacity, along with associated infrastructure at the BP Rotterdam Refinery, the Netherlands,
to enable us to meet an agreed amount of the naphtha requirements of our Köln site. This agreement has an indefinite
term.

**_Commercial Interface Agreements_**

We had a series of agreements with BP, the majority of which have come to an end with the purchase of the

Forties Pipeline System during 2017 by a related party of the Group, covering, among other things:

      - the sale and purchase of hydrocarbons at or between sites where INEOS and BP have a continuing
relationship; and

      - the provision by INEOS to BP and vice versa of services, utilities and infrastructure rights at certain INEOS
sites (both standalone and shared) and in some cases between INEOS’ respective sites.

**Sustainability**

Improving the sustainability of our business and operations is central to the way we work. It is of critical

importance to our employees, to our partners and customers, to the communities in which we operate and to our
investors. It drives innovation across all our businesses and sites.

Our products already make an important contribution to society by providing sustainable options for a wide

range of societal needs, including the preservation of food and clean water, construction of wind turbines, solar panels


-----

and other renewable technologies, construction of lighter and more fuel-efficient vehicles and aircraft, medical devices
and applications, clothing and apparel, and insulation and other industrial and home applications. If polymers and plastics
were to be replaced to the maximum extent in applications where they can be substituted, overall life-cycle GHG
emissions in Europe would increase substantially.

Following the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, most nation states have set the goal to achieve a net zero

emission economy by 2050, and are adopting regulations and legislation to support this. As part of this, there is
widespread acceptance that we should strive for a circular economy, in which materials are re-used to their maximum
extent.

In response, we have put in place plans and actions we believe are needed to lead the transition to a net zero

economy by no later than 2050, whilst remaining profitable, and staying ahead of evolving regulations and legislation.
We have set a target to achieve 33% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 based on bottom-up roadmaps for each
business and have set a target of net zero emissions by 2050.

Specific actions include the following:

      - Product recycling

By 2025, the Group has committed to achieving the following recycling targets:

      - Offer a range of polyolefin products for packaging applications in Europe containing 50% or more
recycled content

      - Use, on average, 30% recycled content in products destined for polystyrene packaging in Europe

      - Incorporate at least 325 kta of recycled material into products

      - Ensure 100% of our polymer products can be recycled

In line with these objectives, and working with our customers, we have designed and launched a new range of

“Recycl-IN” polyolefin products which incorporate up to 50% of post-consumer recycled polymer in materials that meet
the same exacting specifications as virgin material. We are also investing in advanced recycling technologies that will
enable waste polymers to be broken down to their constituent components then reformed back into polymers. This will
enable a much wider range of waste materials to be re-incorporated into polymer manufacturing, reduce GHG emissions
and provide an improved outlet for waste polymers. We are also working with partners to implement new technology to
enable easier sorting of end of life polymers.

      - Improving energy efficiency in existing operations

We are working across all our businesses and sites to make important reductions in energy use and associated

GHG emissions. Optimization projects vary widely, from finding new ways of improving process efficiency to
innovative solutions for heat or power integration, including waste heat valorization and more selective catalysts for
processes. Example projects include recovery and reuse of off-gasses in utilities at our site in Chocolate Bayou, United
States, cooling tower optimization at our site in Köln, Germany, and optimization of steam networks at all sites with
significant steam consumption.

      - Investing in new manufacturing assets

A sustainable business needs to invest in new state of the art manufacturing assets to create a step change

improvement in efficiency and environmental footprint. For example, we are constructing a new cracker complex in the
port of Antwerp for the production of the olefin intermediates used to manufacture polymers and other high value
products which, when commissioned in 2026, is expected to emit less than half of the CO2 emissions as compared with
the next best existing European steam cracker. This is the first investment at this scale in Europe for over 20 years and is
expected to bring a new benchmark to the European industry.

      - Using renewable bio-sourced feedstocks

We are developing certified bio-attributed olefins and polymers. If successfully developed at scale, these

products could provide as much as 100% GHG savings when compared with conventional materials. In addition, in our
Intermediates Division, we have launched new INVIRIDIS bio-attributed sustainable phenol and acetone products and
we have launched new bio-attributed ethylene oxide products.

      - Developing alternative low emission energy sources


-----

We are exploring the use of alternative low emission sources of energy to power our activities. Amongst these,

we are looking at the feasibility of making clean hydrogen for use as a zero-carbon energy source and feedstock for our
operations. We have announced agreements to purchase over 200 MW of renewable wind energy over 10 years for our
facilities in Antwerp and elsewhere, which we expect will result in reductions in our carbon footprint in Belgium by
nearly two million tonnes. We are also carrying out a feasibility study to make green hydrogen for use at our Köln site
and are participating with partners in a project in Antwerp to develop an open access hydrogen network.

We believe that these and other actions will bring substantial benefits to our customers, to the communities in

which we operate, and to all our stakeholders, and help ensure that our businesses remain competitive and sustainable in
light of evolving customer, consumer and societal needs.

**_Sustainalytics Rating_**

As of November 2022, INEOS Group Holdings S.A. received an ESG Risk Rating of 18.6 from Sustainalytics,

and was assessed to be at low risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors. INEOS Group Holdings
S.A.’s ESG Risk Rating ranking us as 11th best (11th lowest risk) of 483 chemical companies so far assessed, and 3rd
best of 234 commodity chemical companies. We believe that this ESG Risk Rating is further evidence that we are seen as
a leader in implementing sustainable practices in our industry. Our ESG Risk Rating is subject to change and the current
rating can be found on the Sustainalytics website. For information on the risks related to ESG Risk Ratings see “ESG
Ratings” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Businesses and Industries—ESG Risk Ratings—The third-party ESG
Risk Ratings referenced in this offering memorandum may not accurately reflect our risks based on environmental, social
and governance matters. Any actual or perceived lack of transparency or underperformance regarding ESG matters as a
result of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lender and other market participants may
adversely affect the value of the Notes.”

**_EcoVadis Gold Award_**

Our progress on sustainability has been recognized by the achievement of a gold award for INEOS AG, one of

our ultimate parent undertakings, in a recent sustainability assessment by EcoVadis in December 2022. This assessment
looks in detail at our work on environment, ethics, labor and human rights, and sustainable procurement. The gold rating
places INEOS AG in the top 8% of all companies assessed and covers not only the Group but also certain of its affiliates
across wider INEOS. INEOS AG was especially recognized for its environmental performance, reflecting the
commitment to carbon emission reduction targets and to recycling and the circular economy. For information on the risks
related to ESG Risk Ratings see “ESG Ratings” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Businesses and Industries—
ESG Risk Ratings—The third-party ESG Risk Ratings referenced in this offering memorandum may not accurately
reflect our risks based on environmental, social and governance matters. Any actual or perceived lack of transparency or
underperformance regarding ESG matters as a result of increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors,
lender and other market participants may adversely affect the value of the Notes.”

**_Governance_**

Safety, health and environment (“SHE”) is governed at a group level and implemented by each business. Each

business determines its own sustainability strategy. Group-wide, this is coordinated through the climate and energy
network (“CEN”). The CEN works with all of our businesses on climate and energy matters. CEN ‘issue teams’ work at
the policy and advocacy level, sharing best practice, new business opportunities and innovation. The network covers
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, heat and power, sustainability, innovation, policy, advocacy and more. Updates from
the CEN and SHE performance are both shared at the half-yearly meetings bringing together the CEOs of all of our
businesses. Every year, the CEO of each of our businesses ensures the compliance of each of their manufacturing sites
with our highest operational and financial standards.

In addition, we have developed a science base to calculate carbon footprints and prepare consistent emission

reduction roadmaps. Our science base is a robust method for emissions accounting in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2-eq)
terms aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. The data collection is managed centrally through the CEN, using a
shared online platform. Our reporting is in line with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, which are set by an
international independent standard organization and which aim to enable third parties to assess environmental impact
from the activities of the company and its supply chain. Furthermore, we have completed the CDP climate change survey
in order to gain external validation for our initiatives.

Our efforts are aligned with 10 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“United Nations

**SDGs”), with particular emphasis on the following areas: good health and well being, clean water and sanitation,**
affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, sustainable cities
and communities, responsible consumption and production, climate action, life below water and partnerships for the
goals. In addition to the United Nations SDGs, we also support the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact.


-----

We also engage with key stakeholders to understand sustainability topics relating to the business that are

important to them. To inform our sustainability strategy and reporting, INEOS identifies topics that are material for the
Group by undertaking regular materiality assessments. For our 2022 sustainability report, this was conducted in
accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative GRI 3 standard, where materiality is defined in terms of impact on the
economy, environment and people. The following topics were identified as material on this basis: climate change,
circular economy, pollution, water, workforce safety, working conditions and political influence. The assessment was
conducted by the Group sustainability team, with oversight from senior executives, involvement of compliance and legal
managers, and assistance from an external consultancy. This materiality assessment and any related conclusions as to the
materiality of sustainability or ESG matters do not necessarily refer to the evaluation of factors, results or other
considerations that are financially material to our business taken as a whole. In particular, the consideration of the
Group’s impact on the sustainability of society and the environment may not be financially material and may not
significantly alter the total mix of information available about the Notes.

In addition, we have also made strides in our approach to product stewardship. We carry out a comprehensive

technical and safety audit of each potential customer before deliveries commence. This check ensures that equipment,
safety protocols and procedures meet our stringent standards, and we work together to be sure deliveries can be safely
received, stored and handled. For example, to ensure safe transport of our products, all Nitriles customers must use
approved logistics service providers. We also audit safety standards at all the major transport hubs that our products pass
through, such as ports, terminals and warehouses. INEOS Nitriles also holds product stewardship conferences in the
United States and in Europe, bringing customers together to review the latest developments in safety.

We are also a signatory to the International Council of Chemical Associations’ (ICCA) Responsible Care Global

Charter. By following the guidelines and measures of Responsible Care we commit to safely conducting our business in
an ethical and environmentally responsible manner and providing the foundation for development and capital
investments. We are committed to fulfilling the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of
Chemicals) obligations which ensures that companies manage the risks associated with their products and provide
customers with the information they need to handle them in a safe and sustainable way. We are also a signatory of
Operation Clean Sweep, a voluntary stewardship program of the Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS) and the
American Chemistry Council. We apply this commitment to achieve zero pellet, flake and powder loss across our sites
and supply chain. We are committed to keeping this material out of the marine environment.

Safe handling and containment of our chemicals and products is of critical importance to us. To monitor our

performance, we have developed a measure to give us early warning of any risks and opportunities to improve. Each of
the materials we use has a maximum legally permitted level at which its leakage into the environment is tolerated.
However, leakage of materials to that level is extremely rare. Our processes, operating procedures and working practices
are all designed to secure containment of all products and raw materials. The loss of containment of any materials is
extremely rare, but each has a level that is legally reportable to the authorities. We closely monitor all systems and we
have internal reporting systems that trigger internal investigation and reporting where there is any loss of containment
that is 10% of the reportable level (“LOC(10)”). The frequency of LOC(10) across wider INEOS has decreased by more
than 80% over the last 10 years.

Limited and are fully paid. The Issuer is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. The issued
capital of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. consists of 924,803 ordinary shares of €1 each, all of which are held by INEOS
Holdings Luxembourg S.A. and are fully paid. The Issuer has not issued any convertible debt securities, exchangeable
debt securities or debt securities with warrants attached.

The Issuer is a wholly-owned finance company that conducts no business operations and has no plans to conduct

any business operations. As of the date of this offering memorandum, as adjusted for the Transactions, the Issuer’s
borrowings are limited to the Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the
2025 Senior Secured Notes and certain borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, each of which is
guaranteed by INEOS Group Holdings S.A., INEOS Luxembourg I S.A., INEOS Holdings Limited and certain of their
subsidiaries. See “Description of the Notes” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.” As of September 30, 2022, as
adjusted for the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions, the total amount outstanding on the Notes would have been
€835.2 million, the total amount outstanding on the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes would have been €770.0 million, the
total amount outstanding on the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes would have been €325.0 million, the total amount
outstanding on the 2025 Senior Secured Notes would have been €550.0 million and the total amounts outstanding under
the Senior Secured Term Loans would have been €5,537.0 million (based on an exchange rate of $0.9766 per €1.00 at

The Issuer has not incurred any additional indebtedness or made any additional investments, in each case other

than the issuance of the Notes, the borrowings and guarantees under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the May
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes through the date
of this offering memorandum. The Issuer may from time to time incur additional indebtedness or make additional
investments in compliance with the terms of its then-outstanding indebtedness.

Accordingly, the Issuer will be dependent upon payments from IHL to make any payments due on the Notes. If

IHL fails to make scheduled payments on the Notes Proceeds Loan, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan or the Senior
Secured Term Loans Euro Proceeds Loans, it is not expected that the Issuer will have any other sources of funds that
would allow it to make payments on its indebtedness. In addition, IHL is a holding company that conducts no
independent business operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Finance
Subsidiary Issuer—The Issuer is a finance company with no independent operations and is dependent on payments under
the Notes Proceeds Loan to provide it with funds to meet its obligations under the Notes.”

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

We enter into transactions with certain related parties or our affiliates from time to time and in the ordinary

course of our business. We believe these agreements are on terms no more favorable to the related parties or our affiliates
than what they would expect to negotiate with disinterested third parties.

**Relationship with INEOS Limited and INEOS AG**

INEOS Limited and INEOS AG, a subsidiary of INEOS Limited, provide operational management services to

the Group through a management services agreement. Management fees of €73.8 million (September 30, 2021:

**Gemini HDPE Term Loans**

**_Overview_**

An Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Group, Gemini HDPE LLC (the “Gemini Borrower”), has €600 million

aggregate principal amount of term loans (the “Gemini Term Loans”) outstanding under a credit agreement dated as of
August 7, 2014 (as amended and restated as of December 31, 2020) (the “Gemini Term **Loan Agreement”) among the**
Gemini Borrower, the lenders party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and Citibank, N.A., as security
agent. The Gemini Borrower is the owner of the Gemini high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) manufacturing facility in
La Porte, Texas.

The Gemini Term Loans do not benefit from any security interests over assets of, or direct guarantees from,

IGH or its Restricted Subsidiaries. However, the Gemini Term Loans are supported by a tolling agreement pursuant to
which the Gemini Borrower manufactures HDPE products for its direct shareholders, INEOS Gemini HDPE Holding
Company LLC and INEOS Gemini HDPE LLC, which are also Unrestricted Subsidiaries (the “Gemini Shareholders”).
The Gemini Shareholders pay the Gemini Borrower for such HDPE products (including amounts to fund the payments
due under the Gemini Term Loans, excluding, among other things, any mandatory prepayments of principal of the
Gemini Term Loans and any payment of principal of the Gemini Term Loans that becomes due and payable upon
acceleration for reasons other than certain defaults under the tolling agreement), and the tolling agreement obligations are
guaranteed on an unsecured basis by IGH. A Restricted Subsidiary of the Group is the operator of the facility and has
been designated by the Gemini Shareholders, in accordance with the tolling agreement, with the exclusive right to supply
the Gemini Borrower with the required components necessary for the production of the HDPE products at the capacity
rights of the Gemini Shareholders under the tolling agreement and to take the quantity of the HDPE products
corresponding to the production rights of the Gemini Shareholders under the tolling agreement and, as compensation, has
agreed to pay to the Gemini Shareholders (or as directed by them) an amount equal to the toll fee payable by the Gemini
Shareholders under the tolling agreement.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Gemini Term Loans bear interest at a rate determined by reference to either (i) LIBOR divided by one

minus the Applicable Reserve Percentage (as defined in the Gemini Term Loan Agreement) (subject to a floor of 0.50%
per annum) plus the Applicable Margin specified below for such loans (“Adjusted Eurodollar **Rate Loans”) or (ii) the**
Base Rate (subject to a floor of 1.50%) plus the Applicable Margin specified below for such loans (“Base Rate Loans”).

The Base Rate is a rate per annum determined as the highest of (a) the rate of interest quoted on such day in the

print edition of The Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section as the “prime rate”, (b) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%
and (c) the reserve-adjusted LIBOR for an interest period of one month (giving effect to the applicable LIBOR floor) plus
1.00%.

The Applicable Margins for the Gemini Term Loans are:

      - in the case of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Loans, 3.00% per annum; and


-----

      - in the case of Base Rate Loans, 2.00% per annum.

All of the Gemini Term Loans were Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Loans as of September 30, 2022.

Overdue amounts owing under the Gemini Term Loan Agreement bear interest (a) in the case of overdue

principal and overdue interest thereon, at the interest rate that would otherwise be applicable to such principal plus 2%
per annum and (b) in the case of other overdue amounts, at the interest rate that would apply to the unpaid principal
amount of Base Rate Loans plus 2% per annum.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement includes a mechanism for establishing an alternate rate of interest to LIBOR

in certain circumstances, such as when the administrator of LIBOR publicly announces that such administrator has
ceased or will cease to provide LIBOR permanently or indefinitely. After June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and
12-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars and the one-month, three-month and six-month LIBOR for U.S. dollars is expected to
be discontinued. As a result of these developments, we intend to amend the Gemini Term Loan Agreement later in 2023
to accommodate the phase-out of LIBOR for U.S. dollars. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our
Capital Structure—Changes or uncertainty in respect of EURIBOR, SOFR or other interest rate benchmarks may affect
our sources of funding, increasing our interest cost and reducing cash flow.”

**_Security and Guarantees_**

The Gemini Term Loans are secured by first priority liens on (i) substantially all assets of the Gemini Borrower

with customary exceptions and (ii) 100% of the equity interests in the Gemini Borrower. Currently, there are no
guarantors under the Gemini Term Loan Agreement; however, the Gemini Term Loan Agreement requires any new
subsidiary of the Gemini Borrower to become a guarantor and grant security over its assets to secure the Gemini Term
Loans.

**_Covenants_**

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Gemini Term Loan Agreement contains negative covenants, including,

_inter alia, covenants restricting the ability of the Gemini Borrower to incur additional indebtedness; make restricted_
payments, including dividends or other distributions; make certain investments; create or incur certain liens; transfer or
sell certain assets; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into sale/leaseback transactions; change the nature
of its business; undertake certain fundamental changes, including to consolidate, merge or liquidate; amend the tolling
agreement and related guarantee and certain other material project documents; amend its organizational documents;
change its accounting policies, reporting practices or fiscal year; enter into certain hedging arrangements; and make
capital expenditures.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement also contains certain affirmative covenants, including, inter alia, covenants

relating to the provision of financial statements and certain other information and notices; inspections; maintenance of
certain insurance; filing of tax returns and payment of taxes; preservation of existence; compliance with laws (including
environmental laws); maintenance of governmental authorizations; maintenance of the HDPE facility; additional
guarantors and security; use of proceeds; further assurances; bank accounts; maintenance of corporate separateness; use
of commercially reasonable efforts to maintain certain ratings; performance of contractual obligations; and books and
records.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.

**_Repayment_**

The Gemini Term Loans are to be repaid in quarterly installments according to a mortgage-style amortization

schedule with 30% of the loan amortizing by the maturity date. The balance of the Gemini Term Loans outstanding will
be payable on December 31, 2027. No amounts repaid in respect of the Gemini Term Loans may be reborrowed.

**_Prepayments_**

Mandatory prepayments of the Gemini Term Loans are required in an amount equal to (i) the net cash proceeds

from certain incurrences of debt and (ii) the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales, insurance proceeds related to
casualty events and eminent domain proceeds, in each case under clause (ii) that are not reinvested by the Gemini
Borrower.

All mandatory prepayments of the Gemini Term Loans will be made without premium or penalty (except for

reimbursement of breakage and redeployment costs in the case of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Loans) and will be applied to


-----

scheduled amortization installments of principal of the Gemini Term Loans in such order as the Gemini Borrower may
specify.

Voluntary prepayments of the Gemini Term Loans are permitted without premium or penalty (except for

reimbursement of breakage and redeployment costs in the case of Adjusted Eurodollar Rate Loans) and will be applied to
the remaining scheduled amortization installments of principal of the Gemini Term Loans as directed by the Gemini
Borrower.

**_Events of Default_**

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement sets out certain events of default, the occurrence of which would allow the

lenders to accelerate all outstanding loans, including, among other events and subject in certain cases to grace periods,
thresholds and other qualifications: non-payment of amounts due under the Gemini Term Loans or under the other
Financing Documents (as defined in the Gemini Term Loan Agreement) or under the tolling agreement guarantee; breach
of covenants; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; cross defaults and certain judgment
defaults; invalidity of the Gemini Term Loan Agreement and other Financing Documents; invalidity of security interests;
certain bankruptcy and insolvency events; the occurrence of certain ERISA-related events; defaults under the project
agreements, including the tolling agreement and related guarantee; abandonment of the HDPE facility; and the
occurrence of a change of control.

**_Miscellaneous_**

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement permits the Gemini Borrower to request extensions of the final maturity of

all or a portion of the Gemini Term Loans and, in that connection, there may be an increase in the interest rates and/or
fees payable with respect to the extended Gemini Term Loans. Such extensions shall be subject to certain conditions
described in the Gemini Term Loan Agreement.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement contains “yank a bank” provisions allowing the Gemini Borrower to replace

a non-consenting lender in connection with (1) amendments and waivers requiring the consent of all lenders or all
affected lenders (or all affected lenders of a particular class of lenders) so long as the required lenders (or, where the
consent of the required lenders is not required, a majority in interest of the lenders of the relevant class) have consented
to such amendments or waivers, (2) any lender becoming a Defaulting Lender (as defined in the Gemini Term Loan
Agreement), (3) any lender failing to consent to any Extension/Modification Request (as defined in the Gemini Term
Loan Agreement) made to such lender and (4) requests by a lender for compensation for increased costs, taxes and
similar items.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement contains loan buyback provisions, which permit, among other things, the

Gemini Borrower to purchase Gemini Term Loans from lenders pursuant to open-market or other transactions or a Dutch
auction, subject to certain conditions, including a requirement that the loans purchased are automatically and permanently
cancelled.

The Gemini Term Loan Agreement is governed by New York law.

**Project ONE Facilities**

**_Overview_**

On December 22, 2022, INEOS Olefins Belgium NV (the “Project ONE Borrower”) entered into certain

agreements (collectively, the “Project ONE Finance Documents”) providing for loans in an aggregate principal amount
of €3,500 million under (i) facilities guaranteed by export credit agencies (UKEF, SACE and CESCE), (ii) a facility
partially guaranteed by Gigarant (a special purpose vehicle of the Flemish government) and (iii) a commercial facility
(collectively, the “Project ONE Facilities”) to fund the construction of Project ONE, a 1,450 ktpa ethane cracker and
olefins complex located in the port of Antwerp. While no funds have been drawn thereunder to date, we expect the
Project ONE Facilities to be drawn in stages, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 and throughout the construction
period to 2026.

During the construction phase, the Project ONE Facilities are supported by a debt service undertaking provided

by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. (“INEOS US I” and, together with IHL, the “Co-Sponsors”), which will be released
upon satisfaction of certain conditions at the completion of construction, including a lenders’ reliability test. In addition,
the Project ONE Borrower entered into a long-term tolling agreement with INEOS Europe AG (“IEAG”), pursuant to
which IEAG is required to pay the Project ONE Borrower, among other amounts, a tolling fee to cover all of the Project
ONE Borrower’s operating costs (including financing costs) and enable the Project ONE Borrower to maintain a


-----

minimum debt service coverage ratio. The obligations under the Project ONE tolling agreement are guaranteed on an
unsecured basis by IGH.

**_Interest and Fees_**

The Project ONE Facilities bear interest at a rate determined by reference to EURIBOR plus the applicable

margins for such loans.

The applicable margins for the Project ONE Facilities are:

      - in the case of the UKEF covered facility, 0.90% per annum;

      - in the case of the CESCE covered facility, 1.20% per annum;

      - in the case of the SACE covered facility, 1.25% per annum;

      - in the case of the commercial facility, from financial close until its seventh anniversary, 2.75% per
annum; from the seventh anniversary of financial close until (and including) its tenth anniversary,
3.25% per annum; and from the tenth anniversary of financial close, 3.50% per annum; and

      - in the case of the Gigarant covered facility, a variable margin that is commercially equivalent to 0.70%
on the covered portion of facility (with such portion decreasing over time) and the applicable
commercial facility margin on the uncovered portion of the Gigarant facility.

Overdue amounts owing under the Project ONE Facilities bear interest at a rate which is 1% per annum above

the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had constituted a loan under the relevant facility.

From financial close until January 31, 2028, at least 70% and no more than 110% of the loan under the Project

ONE Facilities are required to be hedged (or provided on a fixed rate basis).

**_Security_**

The Project ONE Facilities are secured by first ranking perfected security over all or substantially all of the

Project ONE Borrower’s rights, title and interest in and to the assets and undertakings relating to all of its immovable
assets, movable assets, receivables and bank accounts, insurances, investments, book debts, intragroup agreements,
hedging agreements and certain key provision documents, including those rights, title and interest obtained after the
execution of the security document creating such security interest. In addition, INEOS Olefins Belgium Holdings Limited
(the “Project ONE Shareholder”) has granted: (i) a Belgian Law pledge over all of its shares in the Project ONE
Borrower; and (ii) an English Law assignment over shareholder loans made to the Project ONE Borrower.

The secured parties also benefit from the standstill and step-in rights pursuant to agreements entered into with

the counterparties to the tolling agreement, a technology licencing agreement and certain concession documents relating
to the land required for Project ONE within the port of Antwerp.

**_Repayment_**

The Project ONE Facilities are to be repaid in semi-annual instalments according to an amortization schedule

with the first repayment instalment falling due on the earlier of (i) June 30, 2028 and (ii) the first June 30 or December 31
to occur after completion of the performance tests with respect to the ethane cracker. The balance of the Project ONE
Facilities outstanding will be payable 108 months after the first repayment date. No amounts of the Project ONE
Facilities repaid may be reborrowed.

**_Prepayments_**

The Project ONE Finance Documents set out certain mandatory prepayment events, including, among other

events and subject in certain cases to qualifications: illegality, sanctions, insurance and compensation, excess debt,
material export contract changes (in respect of the covered facilities) and failure of the guarantee provided by the relevant
credit export agency or Gigarant, as applicable (in respect of the covered facilities).

Voluntary prepayments of the Project ONE Facilities are permitted, provided that, prior to completion of

construction, voluntary prepayments will be applied on a pro rata basis amongst all Project ONE Facilities and, after
completion of construction, may be applied in prepayment of only the export credit agency covered loans (on a pro rata


-----

basis) and/or in prepayment of only the Gigarant covered facility and the commercial facility (on a pro rata basis
between them).

**_Covenants_**

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Finance Documents contain negative covenants, including

a negative pledge and restrictions on acquisitions, mergers and disposals, incurring financial indebtedness, making loans
or granting third party guarantees, changing its name, business, constitutional documents or accounting year, establishing
additional accounts, making distributions, settling claims, use of proceeds, surrendering tax credits and tax losses,
entering into new material contracts, and amending or terminating material contracts (including the tolling agreement and
related guarantees).

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Finance Documents also contain affirmative covenants

applicable to the Project ONE Borrower, including requirements to comply with applicable laws (including sanctions and
anti-corruption laws and regulations), maintain a pari passu ranking for the Project ONE Facilities, use the proceeds from
the Project ONE Facilities for their stated purposes, file, pay and discharge all taxes, maintain Belgian tax residence,
maintain all required permits and consents, construct Project ONE in accordance with good industry practice and
complete Project ONE on time, enforce rights under the relevant project documents, maintain site and cyber security,
cooperate with the lenders and allow for inspections and audits, diligently operate and maintain Project ONE, acquire and
safeguard intellectual property rights required for Project ONE, appoint and maintain auditors and provide customary
information undertakings (including the provision of ratio statements, financial statements and project budgets and
reports and maintenance of books and records).

Subject to certain agreed exceptions, the Project ONE Finance Documents contain positive covenants applicable

to the Project ONE Shareholder, IGH and IEAG, including a requirement to maintain legal existence, obtain and
maintain applicable consents, comply with applicable laws (including sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and
regulations), file timely tax returns, provide customary information undertakings (including financial statements) and,
only with respect to IGH, (i) use reasonable commercial efforts to facilitate the transportation and supply of feedstock to
Project ONE following an enforcement action and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain a credit rating
from at least one of S&P, Moody’s or Fitch (but not to maintain a specific rating).

In addition, at all times prior to completion of construction and release of the debt service undertaking, IGH is

required (i) to maintain (on a consolidated basis) a minimum liquidity balance (including cash, cash equivalents and
unutilized liquidity facilities) of at least €1.0 billion and (ii) to post collateral (in the form of cash or letters of credit)
and/or accelerate base equity in an amount equal to a percentage of unfunded base equity and projected cost overruns, if
IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by 2 out of 3 rating agencies (or 1 out of 2 agencies if IGH is only rated by 2
agencies).

Prior to completion of construction and release of the debt service undertaking, if IGH’s credit rating is

downgraded by two out of three rating agencies (or one out of two agencies if the Sponsor is only rated by two agencies)
to B-/B3 or below, a draw stop will occur; after completion of construction and release of the debt service undertaking, if
IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by two out of three rating agencies (or one out of two rating agencies if the Sponsor is
only rated by two agencies), the Project One Borrower will be required to either fund the debt service reserve account
(either with cash or letters of credit) with up to nine months of debt service where IGH is downgraded to B+/B1 and up
to 12 months of debt service if IGH is downgraded to B/B2 or lower. Failure to comply with this undertaking will result
in a fundamental event of default (collectively, the “IGH Credit Provisions”).

**_Events of Default_**

The Project ONE Finance Documents set out certain events of default. Prior to the completion of construction

and release of the debt service undertaking, the lenders are only entitled to accelerate the Project ONE Facilities and take
enforcement action if a fundamental event of default has occurred and is continuing. Such fundamental events of default
are subject in certain cases to agreed-upon grace periods and include, among others, non-payment, cross-acceleration,
insolvency and other credit-related events affecting the Project ONE Borrower, the Project ONE Shareholder, IGH,
IEAG, the Co-Sponsors, IFPLC or IUSLLC, the finance documents and tolling agreement (and related guarantee)
ceasing to be effective, failure to complete construction by a longstop date, abandonment and cessation of Project ONE,
nationalisation, destruction of Project ONE, breach of the share transfer restrictions applicable to the Project ONE
Borrower, failure to comply with the IGH Credit Provisions, and breach of anti-corruption laws and representations. At
any time, if IGH’s credit rating is downgraded by one rating agency to CCC/Caa2 or lower and by one other rating
agency to CCC+/Caa1 or lower, a fundamental event of default will occur. Other events of default include, among others,
and subject in certain cases to agreed-upon grace periods, breach of covenants and inaccuracy of representations and
warranties in any material respect.


-----

**_INEOS Group Entity Test_**

Certain credit-related events of default (cross default and insolvency) will apply to IFPLC, IUSLLC and any

other subsidiary of IGH which borrows or issues debt in excess of €400 million (collectively, the “INEOS Group
**Entities”).**

Each of the Project ONE Borrower and IGH will procure that on each date on which IGH provides its financial

statements to the intercreditor agent, the INEOS Group Entities comprise those entities that are borrowers or issuers in
respect of financial indebtedness pursuant to which IGH is a borrower, issuer or guarantor (other than the Securitization
Program, any inventory financings and the Project ONE Facilities) that is at least equal to 75% of the aggregate principal
amount of such financial indebtedness outstanding that time. Failure to comply with this provision constitutes a
fundamental event of default allowing for accelerated payments under the debt service undertaking (pre-completion) and
the tolling guarantee (post-completion).

**_Miscellaneous_**

The Project ONE Facilities are required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of 65:35 through the construction

period, subject to a true-up to 70:30 at completion of construction.

The Project ONE Borrower is permitted to make distributions after the completion of construction and release of

the debt service undertaking, subject to certain conditions, including no default, a minimum 6-month backward-looking
debt service coverage ratio of 1.15:1.00 and a fully funded debt service reserve account.

At all times prior to the full repayment of the Project ONE Facilities, the Project ONE Shareholder must hold

100% of the direct legal and beneficial interests in the shares and voting rights in the Project ONE Borrower. In addition,
IGH is required to own (indirectly) (i) more than 75% of the shares of the Project ONE Borrower until completion of the
first major plant turnaround and (ii) more than 50% of the shares of the Project ONE Borrower thereafter (effectively
maintaining control over the Project ONE Borrower at all times).

The Project ONE Finance Documents are governed by English law, except certain security documents and

direct agreements with Belgian counterparties, which are governed by Belgian law.

**Letter of Credit Facility**

On May 4, 2012, INEOS Treasury (UK) Limited (the “LC Borrower”), a wholly owned subsidiary of INEOS

Investment Holdings (Germany) Limited, entered into an on-demand letter of credit facility (the “LC Facility”) with
Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuing Bank”), under which the LC Borrower may request (on its own behalf or on behalf of
other Group companies) the Issuing Bank to issue letters of credit, guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities (or
any other instrument in a form agreed by the Issuing Bank) (“LC Utilizations”), the outstanding aggregate base currency
amount of which is not more than €300 million. Under the terms of the LC Facility, the LC Borrower undertakes to
provide cash collateral in an amount at least equal to the aggregate of 100% of the maximum actual and/or contingent
liability of the Issuing Bank under each outstanding LC Utilization (or 105%, to the extent cash cover is provided in a
currency other than the currency of an LC Utilization) standing to the credit of an account or certain accounts of the LC
Borrower which are subject to a lien in favor of the Issuing Bank.

**Inventory Financing Facility**

In June 2019, the Group entered into an inventory monetization agreement with J Aron & Company LLC (“J

**Aron”), for an initial term of one year but extendable by mutual agreement (the “Inventory Financing Facility”). Under**
this arrangement, the Group sold certain inventory to J Aron and agreed to buy-back equivalent inventory at the end of
the term at the same price. During the term, and subject to certain covenants and rights of J Aron, J Aron provides the
Group with a just-in-time service for use of the inventory. The Group has the ability to substitute used inventory with
equivalent inventory, in return for a transaction fee, and also to repurchase used inventory for cash. The arrangement is
supported by a Group parent company guarantee and a cash collateral mechanism. The Group and J Aron have agreed to
a number of extensions, including, most recently in June 2022, to extend the term to June 2023. A further extension
option may be exercised by mutual agreement.

**Rafnes Facility**

As part of the Group’s purchase of the remaining 50% interest in the Noretyl ethylene cracker at Rafnes,

Norway from the Kerling group on July 1, 2015, the Group assumed the obligations of a €140.0 million loan facility
(previously known as the “Noretyl Facility”) that Noretyl AS (now known as INEOS Rafnes AS) had in place (as
amended and restated from time to time, most recently by an amendment, restatement and accession agreement dated


-----

November 9, 2022, the “Rafnes Facility”). The current size of the Rafnes Facility is €305.0 million, which amount is
fully drawn. The Rafnes Facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0% per
annum) plus a margin of (i) prior to November 10, 2022, 2.10% and (ii) from (and including) November 10, 2022,
2.25%. The facility matures in November 2027, with the first of six equal semi-annual instalments being made in May
2025. The total amount outstanding at September 30, 2022 was €178.5 million (December 31, 2021: €214.3 million;
December 31, 2020: €250.0 million; December 31, 2019: €250.0 million), of which €71.4 million is due within one year
(December 31, 2021: €71.4 million; December 31, 2020: €35.7 million; December 31, 2019: nil). The facility is secured
by pledges over the property, plant and equipment of INEOS Rafnes AS and benefits from an unsecured guarantee from
IGH.

**Rain Facility**

As part of the Group’s acquisition of a 50% interest in SECCO in December 2022, INEOS China Holdings

Limited, an Unrestricted Subsidiary, as borrower entered into a RMB 1,045 million and $525 million term loan facility
agreement maturing in May 2026 (the “Rain Facility”). The facility agreement contains provisions whereby, as part of
primary syndication (expected to launch in the first quarter of 2023 and complete in the second quarter of 2023), total
commitments under the Rain Facility can be upsized to an amount not exceeding $1,000 million in aggregate.

The Rain Facility carries an interest rate per annum equal to SOFR, subject to certain modifications, plus a

margin of 3.75% (for USD-denominated loans) and HIBOR plus a margin of 4.50% (for RMB-denominated loans), and
matures in June 2026. The Rain Facility is secured by pledges of the shares held by INEOS Investment (Shanghai)
Company Limited (a direct subsidiary of INEOS China Holdings Limited) in SECCO and of the shares held by INEOS
China Holdings Limited in INEOS Investment (Shanghai) Company Limited and benefits from a parent company
guarantee from each of IHL and IGH.

**Securitization Program**

In July 2006, IHL and certain of the other Group companies (such other companies being the “Sellers”) entered

into a five-year €1,500.0 million receivables securitization facility (as amended, supplemented, varied, novated, extended
or replaced from time to time, the “Securitization Program”). The margins on amounts drawn and the commitment fee
on amounts undrawn under the Securitization Program have been amended from time to time, most recently on
December 13, 2017 in respect of the margins and on December 14, 2015 in respect of the commitment fee. On
December 14, 2015, amongst other things, the Securitization Program was updated to include certain newly incorporated
Group entities as Sellers. The overall facility amount has also been amended from time to time, most recently to
€800.0 million pursuant to an amendment deed dated December 14, 2015. On December 17, 2021, the scheduled
termination date for the facility was extended to December 31, 2024. The Securitization Program complies with the terms
for a Permitted Receivables Securitization as defined in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement.

Under the Securitization Program, all trade receivables originated by the Sellers (other than those receivables

that are specifically identified as “excluded receivables”) are sold to a bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicle
incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, INEOS Finance (Ireland) Limited (the “SPV”). The SPV finances
these purchases from borrowings, primarily funded through asset backed commercial paper (“ABCP”) conduits. The cost
of funding for the ABCP conduits reflects the rating of the pooled financial assets in which they invest, thus allowing the
Securitization Program to benefit from financing costs that are not linked to the Group’s corporate rating.

The Securitization Program is restricted to receivables denominated in U.S. dollars, euro or sterling that are sold

to the SPV at face value less a small discount to reflect the carry cost until settlement. In some jurisdictions, the sale of
the receivables requires the involvement of an intermediate purchaser in order to comply with local securities and
banking regulations. The SPV acquires title, on a non-recourse basis, to new receivables as the liability arises and settles
its purchases with the Sellers on a twice-monthly basis. Between settlement dates, the Sellers have the use of the cash
received from customers which has been paid into segregated bank accounts, either in the name of the SPV or held on
trust for the SPV. Responsibility for the administration of the receivables, including adherence to established credit and
collection policies, remains with the Sellers, with IHL acting on their behalf in its capacity as master servicer.

The twice-monthly settlement period is tied to the term of the loans advanced to the SPV by the lenders against

the security of the outstanding receivables. The lenders’ advance rate is adjusted each month to reflect the actual
performance of the receivables portfolio, and standard Rating Agency methodology for calculating loss and dilution
reserves and other potential shortfalls is applied. The balance of the SPV’s funding requirements is provided by IHL
through a subordinated loan facility.

**Köln CoGen Facility**

As part of a project at the Group’s Köln site to replace part of its incineration or cogeneration unit, the Group

entered into a €120.0 million loan facility on December 22, 2017 (as amended, including by an amendment and
restatement agreement dated April 28, 2021, the “Köln CoGen Facility”). The Köln CoGen Facility is made up of two
loan facilities, the original €120.0 million loan facility and an additional €60.0 million loan facility. The total amount
outstanding under the Köln CoGen Facility at September 30, 2022 was €110.3 million (December 31, 2021: €132.0
million) of which €39.0 million (December 31, 2021: €31.5 million) was due within one year.

The original facility matures on December 30, 2024, is to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments of €6.0

million, starting from March 2020, and bears a fixed interest rate of 2.85% per annum. The €60.0 million additional loan
facility was entered into pursuant to the amendment and restatement agreement dated April 28, 2021 and matures on June
30, 2026. It is to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments of €3.75 million starting in September 2022 and bears a fixed
interest rate of 2.00% per annum. The proceeds of the additional loan facility may not be used except in relation to the
cogeneration unit on the Köln site.

The Köln CoGen Facility is secured by pledges over the plant and equipment of INEOS Manufacturing

Deutschland GmbH’s new cogeneration assets.

(iii) any other money or liabilities due, owing or payable by any Obligor to any High Yield Note Issuer or
any Additional Second Secured Borrower or any parent holding company of the Parent which has acceded
to the Intercreditor Deed (other than in respect of any High Yield Proceeds Loan or any Second Secured
Proceeds Loan) (the liabilities referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iii) being, together, the “Subordinated
**Liabilities”), and (iv) any liabilities of the Obligors to the Intra-Group Creditors in such capacity (other**
than liabilities under the Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loans, the Senior Secured Term Loans Proceeds
Loans or certain other loans of the proceeds of any Senior Liabilities to IHL or any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Bottom Swiss Subsidiary (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) (collectively, the “Senior Proceeds
**Loans”)) (the “Intra-Group Liabilities”).**


-----

The Intercreditor Deed does not purport to rank any of the Subordinated Liabilities or Intra-Group Liabilities as

between themselves. The Intercreditor Deed also provides that, subject to the provisions in respect of permitted
payments, the Subordinated Liabilities are postponed and subordinated until the Senior Liabilities, liabilities of the
Obligors and the Parent to the holders of any High Yield Notes and any High Yield Notes Trustee (the “High Yield
**Liabilities”) and the Second Secured Liabilities have been discharged in full.**

The parties to the Intercreditor Deed agree in the Intercreditor Deed that the liens and other security provided by

the Parent and the Obligors rank in the following order:

      - first, the security provided in respect of the Senior Liabilities;

      - second, any security provided separately in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities, if any; and

      - third, the security provided in respect of any High Yield Notes.

Under the Intercreditor Deed, all proceeds from enforcement of security to which the Intercreditor Deed applies

are required to be applied in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Deed, summarized below under “Application
of Proceeds.” Certain security granted by members of the Group (being, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Deed, Lux I
and its subsidiaries), for example certain liens granted by the Obligors, are not governed by the Intercreditor Deed.

**_Permitted Payments_**

The Intercreditor Deed permits, inter alia, payments to be made by the Obligors, each Additional Senior Secured

Borrower (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), and each High Yield Note Issuer to the Senior Lenders under the Senior
Secured Term Loans Agreement, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Trustees, (subject to
certain restrictions) certain hedge counterparties, certain cash management banks and to lenders under any Additional
Senior Finance Documents and holders of any Additional Senior Secured Notes and the Additional Senior Secured Notes
Trustees with respect thereto. The Intercreditor Deed also permits payments to be made without further consents being
obtained:

      - by the Obligors in respect of any Second Secured Liabilities (x) to the extent that the payment is (i) a
payment of scheduled interest (or default interest), (ii) a payment under any customary tax gross-up, tax
indemnity, illegality or increased costs provision, currency indemnity or indemnity in respect of costs and
expenses contained in the Second Secured Documents, or (iii) any consent fee payment customary for the
amendment of the Second Secured Documents, in each case so long as such payment is then due and not
prohibited by any payment blockage described below, and (y) for so long as such payment is not prohibited
by any payment blockage described below, any Obligor may (i) on or after the original maturity date of the
Second Secured Liabilities, and (ii) at any time in connection with any provision of the Second Secured
Documents specifying a mandatory repayment, offer to purchase or redemption which is either permitted
or, if not permitted, provided that consent is obtained from the Majority Senior Lenders, each relevant
Additional Senior Facilities Representative and each relevant Senior Secured Notes Trustee and Additional
Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable), pay the principal amount due or any other amount payable by
it with respect to the Second Secured Liabilities or redeem, acquire or defease the Second Secured
Liabilities;

      - by the Obligors to any holders of High Yield Notes or any High Yield Note Trustee pursuant to the
guarantees to the extent that the payment is (i) a payment of scheduled interest (or default interest), (ii) a
payment under any tax gross-up, tax indemnity or increased costs provisions, provided such provisions are
in customary form, or (iii) a consent fee payment customary for the amendment of any High Yield
Documents, in each case so long as such payment is then due and not prohibited by any payment blockage
as described below (except that payments in respect of High Yield Note Trustee Amounts may always be
made);

      - by IHL or Lux I as borrowers under any High Yield Proceeds Loan to any High Yield Proceeds Lenders in
respect of cash interest on any High Yield Proceeds Loan to enable any High Yield Note Issuer to make a
payment of scheduled interest and default interest in respect of any High Yield Notes (as defined in the
Intercreditor Deed) (the “High Yield Notes”), which payment must fall due within five (5) days of the date
of payment of the corresponding interest by IHL or Lux I to the applicable High Yield Note Issuer, and
certain other payments by IHL or Lux I to any High Yield Proceeds Lender in respect of sums due under
any High Yield Notes (as applicable) and related documents permitted by the Intercreditor Deed, so long as
any such payment is not prohibited by any payment blockage as described below (except that payments in
respect of High Yield Note Trustee Amounts may always be made); and


-----

      - by the Obligors in respect of Intra-Group Liabilities if (i) at the time of the payment no Enforcement Action
(as defined below) has occurred and is continuing in respect of the Senior Liabilities or any Second Secured
Liabilities, (ii) prior to the date on which all Senior Liabilities have been unconditionally discharged in full
(the “Senior Discharge Date”), the consent of the Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed)
to the relevant payment is obtained or (iii) on or after the Senior Discharge Date but prior to the date on
which all Second Secured Liabilities have been unconditionally discharged in full (the “Second Secured
**Discharge Date”), the consent of the Majority Second Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor**
Deed) is obtained.

Prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Second Secured Discharge Date, no Obligor, Additional

Second Secured Borrower or High Yield Note Issuer or any of their subsidiaries may make any payments in respect of
the Subordinated Liabilities unless, prior to the Senior Discharge Date, where the relevant action is prohibited under the
Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Additional Senior Finance Documents or the Senior Secured Note
Documents, the prior consent of the Majority Senior Lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), each security trustee,
facility agent or other similar representative with respect to the creditors under each Additional Senior Finance Document
(the “Additional Senior Facilities Representative”), each Senior Secured Notes Trustee and Additional Senior Secured
Notes Trustee (as applicable and relevant) is obtained and, following the Senior Discharge Date but prior to the Second
Secured Discharge Date, where the relevant action is prohibited under any Second Secured Document, of the Majority
Second Secured Creditors is obtained.

As defined in the Intercreditor Deed, the term “Instructing Group” means the senior creditors under the

Intercreditor Deed whose senior credit participations at the relevant time constitute the simple majority in aggregate
principal amount of the total senior credit participations at the relevant time.

**_Payment Blockage_**

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if any Obligor fails to pay on the due date or within any applicable grace

period any amount payable under the Senior Finance Documents (including relevant hedging agreements and cash
management arrangements), any Additional Senior Finance Document, the Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Senior
Secured Notes or any indenture of any Additional Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes
**Indenture”) or any Additional Senior Secured Notes (all such senior secured notes and indentures, collectively, the**
“Senior Secured Notes And Notes Indentures”) (other than an amount not constituting principal, interest or fees not in
excess of €1,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency)), the Obligors may not make payments in respect of the
Second Secured Liabilities while that failure is continuing. Permitted payments in respect of the Second Secured
Liabilities may be resumed when such payment default is cured or waived.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, if there is any other default that occurs and is continuing under the Senior

Secured Term Loans Agreement, any Additional Senior Finance Documents or any Senior Secured Notes And Notes
Indentures, the Senior Facility Agent (on the instructions of the Majority Senior Lenders (as defined in the Intercreditor
Deed)), or the relevant Additional Senior Facilities Representative or any Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable)
may issue a written stop notice (a “Second Secured Stop Notice”) to each note trustee, security trustee, facility agent or
other similar representative with respect to any holders of interests representing Second Secured Liabilities (the “Second
**Secured Creditors”) (each, a “Second Secured Representative”) and notify IHL. From the date of the issue of such**
notice, the Obligors may not make payments in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities for a period of 179 days (the
“Second Secured Stop Period”), subject to certain exceptions described below.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date, from the date of issue of a Second Secured Stop Notice for the duration of

the Second Secured Stop Period, no payments may be made that would otherwise be permitted by the Intercreditor Deed
in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities unless:

      - the event in respect of which the Second Secured Stop Notice was issued has been cured or waived in
writing by (if the default has occurred and is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing at such
time with respect to the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) the Senior Facility Agent, (if the default is
(or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to any Additional Senior Finance
Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed)) the relevant Additional Senior Facilities Representative,
(if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the Notes) the Trustee,
(if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes), the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the
waiver was) continuing with respect to the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes), the March 2026 Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to
the 2025 Senior Secured Notes), the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Trustee and (if the default is (or
immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to any Additional Senior Secured Notes), the
Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee relating thereto or has ceased to exist;


-----

      - (if at any time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement) the Senior Facility Agent, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing
under any Additional Senior Finance Documents) the relevant Additional Senior Facilities Representative,
(if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the Notes) the Trustee, (if at the time
of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes) the May 2026
Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes) the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if at the time of the
cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes) the 2025 Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under any
Additional Senior Secured Notes) the Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee cancels the Second Secured
Stop Notice or consents to such payment; or

      - if applicable, any Second Secured Standstill Period (as defined below) in effect at the time the Second
Secured Stop Notice was issued has expired and the relevant event of default to which the Second Secured
Standstill Period relates has not been cured or waived.

No Second Secured Stop Notice may be served by the Senior Facility Agent, any Additional Senior Facilities

Representative or any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee in reliance on a
particular payment blockage event more than 75 days after the Senior Facility Agent, any Additional Senior Facilities
Representative, or any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) receives
notice in writing specifying the occurrence constituting that payment blockage event. Not more than one Second Secured
Stop Notice may be served with respect to the same event or set of circumstances. No Second Secured Stop Notice in
relation to a payment blockage event may be served unless (i) 365 days have elapsed since the delivery of any previous
Second Secured Stop Notice in relation to a payment blockage event and (ii) all scheduled payments of interest on the
Second Secured Liabilities that have become due as a result of any previous Second Secured Stop Notice have been paid
in full in cash.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities as a result of the issue of a

Second Secured Stop Notice will not prevent the occurrence of an event of default under the Second Secured Documents
as a consequence of such non-payment or the commencement of an Enforcement Action (defined below) otherwise
permitted by the Intercreditor Deed.

If any Obligor fails to pay on the due date or within any applicable grace period any amount payable under the

Senior Finance Documents (including relevant hedging agreements and cash management arrangements), any Additional
Senior Finance Document, any Senior Secured Notes And Notes Indentures or any Second Secured Document (other
than an amount not constituting principal, interest or fees not in excess of €1,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other
currency)), the Obligors may not make payments (except if such payment is in the form of Permitted High Yield Note
Junior Securities (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) or comprises High Yield Note Trustee Amounts) in respect of the
Subordinated High Yield Liabilities while that failure is continuing. Such payments in respect of any High Yield Notes
may be resumed to the extent permitted under the Intercreditor Deed when such payment default is cured or waived.

Prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Second Secured Discharge Date, if there is any other

default that occurs and is continuing under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, any Additional Senior Finance
Document, any Senior Secured Notes And Notes Indentures or, following the Senior Discharge Date, under any Second
Secured Document, the Senior Facility Agent (on the instructions of the Majority Senior Lenders) or the relevant
Additional Senior Facilities Representative, any Senior Secured Notes Trustee, any Additional Senior Secured Notes
Trustee or the relevant Second Secured Representative (as applicable) may issue a payment blockage notice (a “Stop
**Notice”) to any High Yield Note Trustees and notify each High Yield Representative (as defined in the Intercreditor**
Deed). From the date of the issue of such notice, the Obligors may not make any payments (except if such payment
comprises High Yield Note Trustee Amounts) in respect of the Subordinated High Yield Liabilities or any High Yield
Proceeds Loan for a period of 179 days (the “High Yield Stop Period”), subject to certain exceptions described below.
Prior to the later of the Senior Discharge Date and the Second Secured Discharge Date, from the date of issue of a Stop
Notice for the duration of the High Yield Stop Period, blocked payments may not be made unless:

      - the event in respect of which the Stop Notice was issued has been cured or, prior to the Senior Discharge
Date, waived in writing (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to
the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) by the Senior Facility Agent, (if the default is (or immediately
prior to the relevant waiver was) continuing with respect to any Additional Senior Finance Documents) the
relevant Additional Senior Facilities Representative, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver
was) continuing with respect to the Notes) the Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver
was) continuing with respect to the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes) the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes) the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if the default is (or


-----

immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing with respect to the 2025 Senior Secured Notes) the 2025
Senior Secured Notes Trustee, and (if the default is (or immediately prior to the waiver was) continuing
with respect to any Additional Senior Secured Notes) the relevant Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee
or, following the Senior Discharge Date and prior to the Second Secured Discharge Date, waived in writing
by the relevant Second Secured Representative or has ceased to exist;

      - prior to the Senior Discharge Date, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under
the Senior Facilities) the Senior Facility Agent, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is
continuing under any Additional Senior Finance Documents) the relevant Additional Senior Facilities
Representative, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the Notes) the
Trustee, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes) the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a
default is continuing under the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes) the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, (if at the time of the cancellation or consent, a default is continuing under the 2025 Senior Secured
Notes) the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, and (if at the time of cancellation or consent, a default is
continuing under any Additional Senior Secured Notes) the relevant Additional Senior Secured Notes
Trustee cancels the Stop Notice or consents to such payment;

      - prior to the Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Liabilities have been repaid in full and all the commitments
of the Senior Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) cancelled or following the Senior Discharge
Date the Second Secured Liabilities have been repaid in full; or

      - if applicable, any High Yield Standstill Period (as defined below) in effect at the time the payment Stop
Notice was issued has expired and the relevant event of default to which the High Yield Standstill Period
relates has not been cured or waived.

No Stop Notice may be served by the Senior Facility Agent, an Additional Senior Facilities Representative or

any Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee or a Second Secured Representative (as
applicable) in reliance on a particular payment blockage event more than 75 days after the Senior Facility Agent, each
Additional Senior Facilities Representative, a Senior Secured Notes Trustee, an Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee
or a Second Secured Representative receives notice in writing specifying the occurrence constituting that payment
blockage event. Not more than one Stop Notice may be served by the Senior Facility Agent, each Senior Secured Notes
Trustee or Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee or each Second Secured Representative (as applicable) with respect
to the same event or set of circumstances. No Stop Notice in relation to a payment blockage event may be served unless
(i) 365 days have elapsed since the delivery of any previous Stop Notice in relation to a payment blockage event, and
(ii) all scheduled payments of interest on any High Yield Notes that have become due as a result of any previous Stop
Notice have been paid in full in cash.

Any failure to make a payment due under the indenture for any High Yield Notes (the “High Yield Notes

**Indentures”) or the guarantees of any High Yield Notes as a result of the foregoing will not prevent the occurrence of an**
event of default under any High Yield Notes as a consequence of such non-payment or the commencement of an
Enforcement Action otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Deed.

**_Entitlement to Enforce_**

The Intercreditor Deed provides that the Senior Security Agent will (subject to certain exceptions) enforce the

senior security only at the direction of the Instructing Group. Subject to certain exceptions in relation to the Second
Secured Security (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), prior to the Senior Discharge Date, the Second Secured Creditors
may only take Enforcement Action with respect to the guarantees or security granted pursuant to the Intercreditor Deed
in respect of the Second Secured Liabilities or any Second Secured Proceeds Loan if:

the result of actions of a Second Secured Creditor prohibited under the Intercreditor Deed and provided


-----

occurred.

Prior to the Senior Discharge Date and the Second Secured Discharge Date, the holders of any High Yield Notes

and the trustee under any High Yield Notes (the “High Yield Notes Trustees”) and any lender under any High Yield
Proceeds Loan (together, the “High Yield Creditors”) may only take Enforcement Action with respect to the guarantees
and security granted in respect of any High Yield Notes or the High Yield Proceeds Loan if:

      - the prior written consent of (prior to the Senior Discharge Date) the Instructing Group and (prior to the
Second Secured Discharge Date) the Majority Second Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor
Deed) is obtained;

      - the Senior Creditors and/or any Second Secured Creditors have taken Enforcement Action against an

      - the High Yield Creditors, as applicable, have become entitled to do so as a result of the expiry of any High
Yield Standstill Period unless on the expiry of the High Yield Standstill Period the relevant default to which

The Intercreditor Deed provides that, subject to any consents required from the Majority Senior Lenders and

each Senior Secured Notes Trustee and Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee in certain circumstances being obtained,
the Senior Security Agent is authorized to (i) release any security created by the security documents over the relevant
asset, and (ii) (if the relevant asset comprises all of the shares in the capital of a member of the Group (as defined in the
Intercreditor Deed)) to release that member of the Group and any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries from all past,

(collectively, such indentures, the “Senior Secured Notes Indentures”), a member of the Group sells or
otherwise disposes of (or proposes to sell or otherwise dispose of) any asset at the request or direction of the
Senior Security Agent.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, in the case of any release of the guarantees or security for the Second

Secured Liabilities or for any High Yield Notes, the Second Secured Creditors and the High Yield Creditors will only be
obliged to release and authorize the release set out above in respect of any Obligor or other person which has granted
security or provided a guarantee to the Second Secured Creditors or the High Yield Creditors:

      - in the case of the Second Secured Liabilities and any security in respect thereof, if the Majority Second
Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) have approved the release; or

      - in the case of guarantees and security for any High Yield Notes and High Yield Notes Indenture, if the
trustee or other representative under each High Yield Notes Indenture confirms to the Senior Security
Agent that the holders of any High Yield Notes which it represents have approved the release; or

      - if the shares or assets of an Obligor (or the shares of any direct or indirect holding company of such
Obligor) are sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Security
Agent (or any receiver or administrator) or at the request or direction of the Senior Security Agent, and the
sale or disposal is completed in accordance with applicable law and for a consideration all or substantially
all of which is in the form of cash or certain cash equivalents; and

(1) in the case of a sale or disposal of shares of an Obligor (or the shares of any direct or indirect
holding company of such Obligor) (but only to the extent that any guarantees and security for
any High Yield Notes or High Yield Notes Indenture are to be released), concurrently with the
completion of such sale or disposal, the indebtedness of the relevant members of the Group
being disposed of to (x) the Senior Creditors, (y) the Second Secured Creditors and (z) the
lenders of all Subordinated Debt (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) and Public Debt (as


-----

defined in the relevant High Yield Indenture or other document) that is Pari Passu Debt (as
defined in the Intercreditor Deed) are discharged or released (and not assumed by the relevant
purchaser or any affiliate thereof); provided, however, that performance bonds and similar
instruments will not be required to be so discharged or released; and

(2) if applicable, in the case of a sale or disposal of assets other than shares in an Obligor as
provided above, concurrently with the completion of such sale or disposal the prior ranking
security in favor of the Senior Creditors over such assets is released,

and, in the case of paragraphs (1) and (2) above, either (x) the sale or disposal is made pursuant to a
Public Auction (as defined below) or (y) an internationally recognized investment bank or an
internationally recognized accounting firm selected by the Senior Security Agent has delivered in
respect of the sale or disposal an opinion to (in the case of a sale by or at the request of the Senior
Security Agent (or any receiver or administrator)) the trustee or representative under any High Yield
Notes Indenture and each Second Secured Representative that the amount received in connection with
such sale is fair from a financial point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances including
the method of enforcement; provided that the liability of such investment bank or accounting firm in
giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such engagement.

A “Public Auction” is defined in the Intercreditor Deed to mean an auction in which more than one bidder

participates or is invited to participate conducted with the advice of an internationally recognized investment bank and in
which if the sale is undertaken by or at the request of the Senior Security Agent (or any receiver or administrator),
pursuant to an enforcement requested by (a) the Instructing Group, in which case the Second Secured Creditors and the
High Yield Creditors will have a right to participate in such auction and (b) the Second Secured Creditors, in which case
the High Yield Creditors will have a right to participate in such auction.

The Intercreditor Deed also provides that, subject to any consents required from the Majority High Yield

Creditors being obtained, the Senior Security Agent, any High Yield Notes Trustee and the applicable Second Secured
Representative are authorized to release any security created by the security documents over (i) any assets disposed of in
a manner permitted pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Term Loans, any Additional Senior Secured Term Loans,

the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Indenture, any Additional
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Second Secured Documents with effect from whichever is the earlier of (1) the
date such receivable is disposed of or (2) the date such receivable is offered for disposal or, if not in existence when
offered for disposal, the date it subsequently comes into existence.

The Intercreditor Deed further provides that, if it is necessary to do so in order to give effect to certain

provisions of the Intercreditor Deed providing that in connection with any refinancing, restructuring, replacement,
extension, supplement, increase or incurrence of additional Senior Liabilities and any Second Secured Liabilities such
indebtedness shall be secured in priority to the Subordinated High Yield Liabilities, each High Yield Notes Trustee or
other representative shall release any security interest which has been granted to it provided that such release occurs on
the date of such refinancing, restructuring, replacement, extension, supplement, increase or incurrence and a new security
interest is granted to the High Yield Notes Trustee or other representative immediately upon the grant of security
interests in respect of such refinancing, restructuring, replacement, extension, supplement, increase or incurrence.

**_Option to Purchase Debt under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indentures_**

If the Senior Creditors under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, any Senior Secured Notes Indenture,

any Additional Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any Additional Senior Finance Document have taken any Enforcement

-----

debt and accrued and unpaid interest and fees and expenses, (ii) in the case of any Senior Secured Notes or Additional
Senior Secured Notes, at a price equal to the principal amount of such debt and accrued and unpaid interest, any
prepayment fees and other fees and expenses and (iii) in the case of any Second Secured Documents, at a price equal to
the principal amount of such debt and accrued and unpaid interest, any prepayment fees and other fees and expenses. The
Intercreditor Deed also provides for the price to be paid in relation to hedging agreements and cash management
arrangements. Upon such purchase, the purchasers will assume the rights and obligations of the lenders under the Senior
Secured Term Loans, and any Additional Senior Lender Liabilities, including hedging arrangements, and the rights and
obligations of the holders of any Senior Secured Notes, any Additional Senior Secured Notes and the rights and
obligations of the creditors under any Second Secured Documents.

**_Amendment_**

The terms of the Intercreditor Deed may only be amended or waived with the written agreement of each of the

Senior Facility Agent, each Additional Senior Facilities Representative, any High Yield Notes Trustee, any Second
Secured Representative, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the
2025 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Trustee, any Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee and IHL unless (i) any
amendments are made to cure defects, resolve ambiguities or reflect changes of a minor, technical or administrative
nature, which may be made by the Senior Security Agent and IHL, (ii) any amendments are made to meet the
requirements of any person proposing to act as a senior secured note trustee or high yield note trustee which are
customary for persons acting in such capacity, which amendments may be made by the Senior Security Agent and IHL,
(iii) any amendments which only affect the rights and obligations of one party or class of parties and are not adverse to
the rights of the other parties or class of parties, which may be made by only IHL and the party or class of parties affected
thereby, or (iv) any amendments are made to give effect to the appointment of an Additional Senior Facilities
Representative in respect of the Additional Senior Finance Parties or a Second Secured Representative in respect of the
Second Secured Creditors, which amendments may be made by the Senior Security Agent and IHL. Subject to (i) and
(ii) in the previous sentence, no amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Deed may impose new or additional
obligations on any party to the Intercreditor Deed or affect the rights or obligations of the Senior Facility Agent, the May
2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, the Trustee, any Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Senior Security Agent or the trustee or
representative under any High Yield Notes Trustee, or certain other persons in each case without their prior written
consent.

The Senior Security Agent may amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of, or grant consents under,

any of the Senior Security Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) acting on the instructions of the Senior
Facility Agent and (where such consent is required under any Additional Senior Finance Document) of each relevant
Additional Senior Facilities Representative and (where such consent is required under any Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, Additional Senior Secured Notes Indenture or related documents) of the applicable Senior Secured Notes
Trustee or Additional Senior Secure Notes Trustee. Any such amendment, waiver or consent will be deemed to be an
amendment, waiver or consent of any equivalent Security Document (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) granted in
favor of the Second Secured Creditors or any High Yield Notes Trustee and the holders of any High Yield Notes but only
to the same extent and to no greater extent than the amendment, waiver or consent in relation to the relevant Senior
Security Document. Any such amendment, waiver or consent will also be binding on the hedge counterparties save to the
extent that in respect of such amendment, waiver or consent the hedge counterparties are treated in a manner which is
different to the other Senior Creditors in which event the consent of the hedge counterparties shall also be required. No
such amendment, waiver or consent will (without prejudice to any other provision of the Intercreditor Deed) release any
security granted to the Second Secured Creditors or any High Yield Notes Trustee or holders of any High Yield Notes
except as permitted under the Second Secured Documents or a High Yield Notes Indenture, as applicable.

Notwithstanding the above, any High Yield Notes Trustee, each Second Secured Representative, any Senior

Secured Notes Trustee, any Additional Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Senior Facility Agent, each Additional Senior
Facilities Representative and the Senior Security Agent are authorized to enter into such agreement or agreements with,
among others, the Obligors and each High Yield Notes Issuer, whether by way of supplement, amendment or restatement
of the Intercreditor Deed or by a separate deed, as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions under the
Intercreditor Deed relating to, among others, a permitted refinancing of the Senior Liabilities, the Second Secured
Liabilities or the liabilities in respect of any High Yield Notes.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Deed, the provisions of the Intercreditor Deed override

anything in any of the finance documents to the contrary.

The Intercreditor Deed is governed by English law.

The €400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6 ⅝% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Euro Notes”) and

$425,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6 ¾% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Dollar Notes”) were issued
under an indenture (the “Indenture”) dated as of February 16, 2023 (such date, the “Issue Date”) among, inter alios,
INEOS Finance plc, as issuer (the “Issuer”), the guarantors party thereto (the “Guarantors”), BNY Mellon Corporate
Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), and Barclays Bank PLC, as security trustee (in
such capacity, the “Security Trustee”). Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,”

Additional Notes that are issued under the Indenture.

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the guarantees provided by

the Guarantors (the “Guarantees”) and the Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements and refers to the Security Documents and

provisions of those agreements, such provisions, including the definitions of certain terms, are qualified in their entirety
by reference to all of the provisions of such agreements.

The Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Documents will be subject to the terms of the

Intercreditor Deed and any additional intercreditor agreements entered into in the future. The terms of the Intercreditor
Deed are important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees. Please see the section
entitled “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed” for a summary of certain material terms of the
Intercreditor Deed.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as its owner for all purposes. Only registered holders will have

rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies.
The Notes have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. The
Indenture is not required to be nor will it be qualified under and will not include or incorporate any provisions by
reference to (except with respect to certain communications by Holders) or otherwise be subject to the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act.

For definitions of certain capitalized terms used in the following summary, please see “—Certain Definitions.”

of the Issuer, the Company (as defined below), the Parent, any other Guarantor or a Surviving Entity, the Issuer, the
Company, the Parent, such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity, as the case may be, may, at its election, satisfy such
delivery requirement by the delivery of a certificate, or equivalent, of an officer of any of the Issuer, the Parent, the

officer, the senior management or the Board of Directors thereof, or the Company or an officer, the senior management
or the Board of Directors thereof, Luxco I or an officer, the senior management or the Board of Directors thereof, or IHL
or an officer, the senior management or the Board of Directors thereof (in each case, as applicable), at the Parent’s
election.

**Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

      - be general senior obligations of the Issuer;

      - be secured as set forth below under “—Security”;

      - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are not expressly
subordinated to the Notes, including, without limitation, the obligations under the March 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Credit Facilities;

      - be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors;


-----

      - rank effectively senior to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are unsecured or secured by
Liens junior to the Liens securing the Notes to the extent of the value of the Collateral;

      - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the Issuer that are expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; and

      - will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the liabilities of, including trade payables and
letters of credit issued by, INEOS Luxembourg I S.A.’s (the initial “Company”) Subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes.

The Issuer is a finance company that has no Subsidiaries. Upon completion of the offering of the Notes, the only

significant assets of the Issuer will be the Notes Proceeds Loan, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan,
the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan and the
euro-denominated SFA Proceeds Loans and, as such, the Issuer will be dependent on payments by IHL on such proceeds
loans in order to service its Indebtedness, including the Notes.

As of September 30, 2022, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes and the application of the

proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds” and the Post-Q3 Transactions and the Transactions, the Parent
would have had total consolidated loans and borrowings of €9,276.0 million.

The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other obligations of the

Issuer that are secured by Liens senior to the Liens securing the Notes or secured by property and assets that do not
secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness and other obligations.

Certain Liens securing the Notes created under German and French law will, as a matter of local law, be granted

as junior ranking Liens in relation to the Liens in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Nevertheless, the Intercreditor
Deed provides that as a contractual matter as among Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the
Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured
Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging obligations and certain cash
management obligations and will be treated as such for purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement of
such Collateral.

The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured

Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York,
Luxembourg and Norwegian law will remain in place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some jurisdictions, the
Security Documents creating the existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes will be amended to
extend such Liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these Liens extend) to the Notes (or, with respect
to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security interests will be granted). The existing
first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026
Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Jersey law, Scottish law
and Singapore law will remain in place, and new Liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to
secure the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new Liens are created, the ranking of these new Liens relative to the
existing Liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the Liens, the order
of creation of the Liens, compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the Liens and the
order of giving notices with respect to the Liens, and accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new Liens would be
likely to rank after the existing Liens. However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the Liens
securing the Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will rank pari passu and will be treated as having equal priority with
respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any Collateral.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Deed, the proceeds of any enforcement of the Collateral will be applied,

subject to the rights of creditors mandatorily preferred by law applying to companies generally, pro rata to repayment of
the Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the Hedging Obligations to the extent the relevant counterparties accede to the
Intercreditor Deed (the “Hedging Liabilities”) and the Cash Management Arrangements to the extent the relevant
counterparties accede to the Intercreditor Deed (the “Cash Management Liabilities”). The Intercreditor Deed limits the
ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Trustee to take enforcement action. Please see
“—Enforcement of Security,” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.”

In addition, the Notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities

of the Company’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.


-----

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Deed will permit the Issuer to issue Indebtedness secured by Liens on the

Collateral securing the Notes, which Liens may, under certain circumstances, rank ahead of the security interests on the
Collateral securing the Notes. Please see “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens.”_

**_The Guarantees_**

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors. Each Guarantee will:

      - be joint and several and will be the general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

      - be secured as set forth below under “—Security;”

      - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor that are
not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee, including with respect to the Guarantee
of the Notes by each Guarantor, Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the Guarantees
of the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured
Notes, the guarantees by IGH and IHL under the Rain Facility, the guarantee from IGH under the Rafnes
Facility and the debt service undertaking by IGH, IHL and INEOS US I Inc. under the Project ONE
Facilities;

      - rank effectively senior to all existing and future obligations of such Guarantor that are unsecured or secured
by Liens junior to the Liens securing the Guarantees to the extent of the value of the Collateral; and

      - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future obligations of the applicable Guarantor that are
expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Guarantee.

The Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and other obligations of

such Guarantor that are secured by Liens senior to the Liens securing such Guarantee or secured by property and assets
that do not secure such Guarantee, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness and
other obligations. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency, each such secured lenders will have a prior secured claim to
any collateral of such Guarantor securing the debt owed to them.

Not all of the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. However, each of the Company’s

Subsidiaries that as of the Issue Date will guarantee the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will also guarantee the Notes. As of the
Issue Date, the Notes will be jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. The
Guarantors together represent 91.7% of the Parent’s consolidated EBITDA before exceptionals for the 12-month period
ended September 30, 2022 and hold 87.0% of the Parent’s consolidated total assets as of September 30, 2022 (in each
case, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by, the guarantor maintenance covenant in the Senior
Secured Term Loans Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date after giving effect to the exclusion of the Consolidated
EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) and consolidated total assets of certain subsidiaries
of the Parent (including Unrestricted Subsidiaries), which represent approximately 1.1% of the Parent’s consolidated
EBITDA before exceptionals for the same period and hold approximately 6.9% of the Parent’s consolidated total assets
as of September 30, 2022). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Structural
_Subordination—The Notes and each guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and any preferred stock_
_of the non-Guarantor subsidiaries.” In addition, on December 31, 2020, the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest_
in the Gemini HDPE LLC which increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100% through Unrestricted Subsidiaries. On
the Issue Date, the Company has designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries INEOS Real Estate GmbH & Co. KG, which
owns an office building in Köln, Germany; Gemini HDPE LLC, INEOS Gemini HDPE LLC and INEOS Gemini HDPE
Holding Company LLC, which produce high density polyethylene in La Porte, Texas, United States; INEOS China
Holdings Limited, INEOS China Holdings II Limited, INEOS China Holdings III Limited, INEOS Tianjin Holdings
Limited, INEOS Investment (Tianjin) Company Limited and INEOS Investment (Shanghai) Company Limited, which
include the holder of the 50% interest in SECCO and, upon completion, will include the holder of the 50% interest in the
Tianjin Nangang Ethylene Project; and INEOS Nitriles (UK) Limited.

The obligations of the Guarantors under their Guarantees will be limited as necessary to recognize certain

limitations imposed due to local law and defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable
law. Please see “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our
_Capital Structure—Insolvency laws—Relevant insolvency laws in England, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions may_
_provide you with less protection than U.S. bankruptcy law,” “—Guarantees and Collateral Limitations—The guarantees_


-----

_and pledges of Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or_
_subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” and “—Enforcement of French share_
_pledges—Under the security interests governed by French law, you may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you_
_decide to enforce the pledge of the shares by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares of_
_INEOS France SAS or INEOS Technologies France SAS rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction” and_
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees, the Collateral and Certain Insolvency Considerations.”

The obligations of any Guarantor under its Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and

discharged in certain circumstances. Please see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed” and “—Release
_of the Guarantees.”_

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

The Guarantee provided by any Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and terminated,

without any action by, or the necessity of the consent of, the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the holders of the Notes as
follows (and each holder of the Notes will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized the Trustee and the Security Trustee

execute and deliver) any document to the extent necessary or reasonably requested by the Company to evidence such
release and termination):

Guarantor (other than the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the Issuer)) that

release, the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement) of the
Issuer and the Guarantors is at least 85% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Parent, the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries and the consolidated total assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors is at least
85% of the consolidated total assets of the Parent, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each
case, calculated in accordance with, and in the manner provided by and subject to the same exceptions


-----

as those set forth in, Section 7.11(a) of the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement as in effect on the
Issue Date (after giving effect to the modifications included in Exhibit L-1 thereto), including the
exclusion of the Consolidated EBITDA and consolidated total assets of any Receivables Subsidiary,
any Project Finance Subsidiary, any Project Finance Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
special purpose entity, bankruptcy remote entity, captive insurance company or any not-for-profit
entity, INEOS Belgium and its subsidiaries, to the extent any Rafnes Entity is a Restricted Subsidiary,
the Rafnes Entities, any Restricted Subsidiary organized under the laws of an Excluded Jurisdiction and
any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary and its subsidiaries, any
cash, cash equivalents and Temporary Cash Investments of the LC Account Parties, any receivables
that are subject to any Permitted Receivables Financing and any inventory or assets relating thereto that
are subject to any inventory financing or similar arrangement permitted under the Indenture;

(j) with respect to any Guarantor, upon written notice from the Company to the Trustee, as part of any
Permitted Reorganization;

(k) upon the full and final payment of all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture; and

(l) in accordance with the Intercreditor Deed;

_provided, however, that the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Trustee delivered_
prior to the automatic release and termination of any Guarantee as specified above, to (A) waive such automatic release
and termination of such Guarantee and maintain such Guarantee in effect until such time as the Company shall instruct
and direct the Trustee in writing to release and terminate such Guarantee or (B) elect that the release and termination of
such Guarantee shall not occur automatically as contemplated by this paragraph but shall occur at such other time or
times, in such manner and order and upon the occurrence of such other events as shall be specified by the Company in
such notice to the Trustee; provided further that nothing in this clause (B) shall allow the Company to require the release
and termination of any Guarantee prior to (unless such release and termination is to occur substantially concurrently
with) the occurrence of the applicable event(s) set forth in clauses (a) through (l) above providing for the release and
termination thereof.

In addition, the Intercreditor Deed will provide for the release of certain Guarantees upon an enforcement sale

and as otherwise specified in the Intercreditor Deed. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed”. The
Indenture will provide that any release of a Guarantee may be evidenced, at the Issuer’s option, by the delivery by the
Issuer to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, and the Trustee shall, at the Issuer’s request, acknowledge
and confirm receipt of such Officer’s Certificate.

**_Security_**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will be

secured by, subject to Permitted Collateral Liens, first-ranking Liens over the Collateral (or, with respect to French and
certain German security interests, junior ranking security interests) as described in “Description of the Collateral and the
_Guarantees”._

Certain Liens securing the Notes created under German and French law will, as a matter of local law, be granted

as junior ranking Liens in relation to the Liens in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Nevertheless, the Intercreditor
Deed provides that as a contractual matter as among Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the
Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured
Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain
Cash Management Arrangements and will be treated as such for purposes of the application of proceeds from the
enforcement of such Collateral.

The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured

Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York,
Luxembourg and Norwegian law will remain in place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some jurisdictions, the
Security Documents creating the existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes will be amended to
extend such Liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these Liens extend) to the Notes (or, with respect
to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security interests will be granted). The existing
first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026
Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Jersey law, Scottish law
and Singapore law will remain in place, and new Liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to
secure the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new Liens are created, the ranking of these new Liens relative to the


-----

existing Liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the Liens, the order
of creation of the Liens, compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the Liens and the
order of giving notices with respect to the Liens, and accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new Liens would be
likely to rank after the existing Liens. However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the Liens
securing the Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will rank pari passu and will be treated as having equal priority with
respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any Collateral.

The Collateral will also secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior

Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the Hedging Liabilities and the
Cash Management Liabilities on a pari passu basis. The Liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
are already in place. In some jurisdictions, the Security Documents creating such Liens will be amended to extend such
Liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these Liens extend) to the Notes (or, with respect to French
and certain German security interest, junior ranking security interests will be granted). The existing first-ranking Liens
securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes
and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York, Luxembourg and Norwegian law will remain in
place and will extend to secure the Notes. The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were
created under English law, Jersey law, Scottish law and Singapore law will remain in place, and new Liens over the same
Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new Liens are created, the
ranking of these new Liens relative to the existing Liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors,
such as the nature of the Liens, the order of creation of the Liens, compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection
requirements with respect to the Liens and the order of giving notices with respect to the Liens, and accordingly without
the Intercreditor Deed, the new Liens would be likely to rank after the existing Liens. However, the Intercreditor Deed
provides that, as a contractual matter, the Liens securing the Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026
Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will rank pari passu and
will be treated as having equal priority with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any
Collateral.

The Collateral is granted pursuant to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Deed to the Security Trustee

on behalf of the holders of the secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral, including the Notes. For a
description of the Collateral and the Security Documents, see “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees”. For a
discussion of the ranking of the Collateral and the application of the proceeds thereof, see “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed”._

The requirements for the granting of Liens under the Indenture, arising at any time on or after the Issue Date,

will generally be subject to certain security principles described under “—Security Principles”. In addition, the Liens on
the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations and are at all times in all cases subject to the requirements of
applicable law. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Insolvency laws—
_Relevant insolvency laws in England, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions may provide you with less protection than U.S._
_bankruptcy law”, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Guarantees and Collateral_
_limitations—The guarantees and pledges of Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability”, “Risk Factors—_
_Enforcement of French share pledges—Under the security interests governed by French law, you may be required to pay_
_a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges of the shares by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the_
_Collateral consisting of shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and INEOS France SAS rather than by a sale of such_
_Collateral in a public auction” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests”._

A Lien on certain of the Collateral described under “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees—

_Summary of the Guarantees and Collateral for the Notes” will be granted to secure the Obligations under the Indenture,_
the Notes and the Guarantees on the Issue Date (such Collateral, the “Initial Collateral”), and, to the extent not also
granted on the Issue Date, the Issuer and the Guarantors will be required to grant the other Collateral described under
“Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees—Summary of the Guarantees and Collateral for the Notes” (such
other Collateral, the “Additional Collateral”) no later than 30 days after the Issue Date or, in the case of certain deposit
accounts and security account control agreements and certain real property collateral, 60 and 90 days after the Issue Date,
respectively. The Notes and the related Guarantees will be secured by first priority Liens (subject to certain exceptions)
on the same assets that secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes
_and Our Capital Structure—Post-Closing Collateral—The Post-Closing Collateral will not initially secure the Notes”._

The Issuer and each Guarantor shall take such necessary actions and shall cause its respective Restricted

Subsidiaries to take such necessary actions so that Liens over the Collateral in respect of the Notes shall be granted to the


-----

Security Trustee on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the holders of the Notes pursuant to the Security Documents as
contemplated by the Indenture.

The Issuer and each Guarantor shall, and shall procure that each of its respective Subsidiaries shall, at its own

expense, execute and do all such acts and things and provide such assurances as the Security Trustee may reasonably
require (i) for registering any Security Document relating to the Collateral in any required register and for perfecting or
protecting the security intended to be afforded by such Security Document relating to the Collateral and (ii) if such
Security Document has become enforceable in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the relevant Security
Document and the Intercreditor Deed, for facilitating the realization of all or any part of the Collateral which is subject to
such Security Document and for facilitating the exercise of all powers, authorities and discretions vested in the Security
Trustee or in any receiver of all or any part of such Collateral. The Issuer and each Guarantor shall, and shall procure that
each of its respective Subsidiaries shall, execute such transfers, conveyances, assignments and releases of that property
whether to the Security Trustee or to its nominees and give such notices, orders and directions which the Security Trustee
may reasonably request.

**_Security Documents_**

The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by, subject to Permitted Collateral Liens, first-ranking Liens over

the Collateral (or, with respect to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security interests). Certain
of the Liens on the Initial Collateral will be perfected after the Issue Date and certain of the Liens on the Additional
Collateral will be perfected after the date that is 30 days following the Issue Date or, in the case of certain deposit
accounts and security account control agreements and certain real property collateral, 60 and 90 days after the Issue Date,
respectively, in each case in accordance with applicable law. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
_Our Capital Structure—Perfection of security interests—Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the_
_failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral”. The Collateral will be granted pursuant to the Security Documents_
to the Security Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes.

Certain Liens securing the Notes created under German and French law will, as a matter of local law, be granted

as junior ranking Liens in relation to the Liens in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities the March 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. Nevertheless, the Intercreditor
Deed provides that as a contractual matter as among Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the
Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured
Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, certain Hedging Obligations and certain
Cash Management Arrangements and will be treated as such for purposes of the application of proceeds from the
enforcement of such Collateral.

In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of security

interests in such jurisdictions, the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Deed will provide for the creation of “parallel debt”
obligations in favor of the Security Trustee, and the security interests in such jurisdictions will secure the parallel debt
(and not the Indebtedness under the Notes). The parallel debt construct has not been tested under law in certain of these
jurisdictions. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Decisions regarding
_Collateral—Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral”._

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—

_Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”, the Issuer and the Guarantors are_
permitted to grant Liens on the Collateral in connection with certain future incurrences of Indebtedness, including any
Additional Notes permitted under the Indenture, on terms consistent with the relative priority of such Indebtedness. In
addition, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Deed also will permit the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue
Indebtedness secured by Liens on the Collateral, which Liens may, under certain circumstances, rank ahead of the Liens
on the Collateral securing the Notes. Please see “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”_

Each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed (i) to have authorized (a) the Trustee and the

Security Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Deed and (b) the Security Trustee to enter into the Security Documents
and (ii) in each case, to have agreed to be bound thereby. Each holder of the Notes, by accepting a Note, appoints the
Security Trustee as its agent under the Security Documents and authorizes it to act as such.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents (including the terms

described under “—Enforcement of Security” and “—Release of Security”), the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable,
will be secured by the Liens on the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been
discharged.


-----

In the event that the Issuer, the Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries enters into insolvency,

bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Liens securing the Notes created under the Security Documents could be subject
to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of such Liens is successful, the holders of the Notes may not be
able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and
_Our Capital Structure—Insolvency laws—Relevant insolvency laws in England, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions may_
_provide you with less protection than U.S. Bankruptcy Law”, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital_
_Structure—Guarantees and Collateral Limitations—The guarantees and pledges of Collateral will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their_
_validity and enforceability”, and “Risk Factors—Enforcement of French share pledges—Under the security interests_
_governed by French law, you may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the pledges of the_
_shares by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS_
_and INEOS France SAS rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction”._

**_Security Principles_**

The Indenture will provide that certain requirements for the providing of Guarantees and the granting and

perfecting of Liens in favor of the holders of the Notes and the Trustee will generally be subject to the Security Principles
as set forth in the Indenture. The Security Principles embody recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and
practical difficulties in obtaining Guarantees or granting or perfecting Liens. In particular:

(a) Factors that will be considered when determining whether Guarantees or Liens will be provided or
granted, or the extent to which the Guarantees or Liens will be granted or perfected (including the
maximum amount guaranteed or secured), will include general statutory limitations, financial
assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, “thin capitalization” and
similar laws, rules and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, retention of title claims, employee
consultation or approval requirements and the extent to which the giving or the terms of a Guarantee,
the granting of Liens or, prior to the Liens created under the Security Documents becoming enforceable
in accordance with the Security Documents, the extent of the perfection requirements would materially
and adversely impact the business, or commercial relationships with third parties, of the Issuer or the
relevant Guarantor, as applicable, in the ordinary course. Subject to the Security Principles, if any
Guarantee or the amount secured by any Lien is to be limited, the Guarantee and the Liens provided or
granted will extend to the maximum amount that the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor may provide in
accordance with applicable law, rules, regulations and current and customary market practice in the
relevant jurisdiction. In furtherance of and without limiting the foregoing:

(i) No Guarantee will be required to be provided, and no Lien will be required to be granted or
perfected, if to do so would reasonably be expected to result (or, if the provision, grant or
perfection thereof would not, in and of itself, reasonably be expected to result in such breach,
the applicable Guarantee and the granting or perfection of the applicable Lien will be limited
to the extent consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction
to the extent the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result) in a breach of general
statutory limitations, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, “thin capitalization” or similar laws, rules or regulations of any applicable
jurisdiction, provided that the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts (A) to assist
in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to the Issuer and each relevant
Guarantor, as applicable, (B) to complete any whitewash or similar procedure required under
any relevant financial assistance laws and (C) otherwise to overcome or mitigate any such
limitations through measures reasonably available to the Issuer and the relevant Guarantors, as
applicable.

(ii) Each Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available
to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, capital maintenance, corporate benefit or similar laws, rules
or regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other similar
considerations under applicable law.

(iii) No Guarantee will be required to be provided, and no Lien will be required to be granted or
perfected, if to do so would reasonably be expected (or, if the provision, grant or perfection
thereof would not, in and of itself, reasonably be expected to result in such conflict or
violation, the applicable Guarantee and the granting or perfection of the applicable Lien will
be limited to the extent consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant
jurisdiction to the extent the failure to do so would reasonably be expected) (A) to conflict
with the fiduciary duties of directors or officers of the Issuer, the applicable Restricted


-----

Subsidiary or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, or to give rise to or result in personal, civil
or criminal liability on the part of any director, officer, legal representative or shareholder of
the Issuer, the applicable Restricted Subsidiary or Guarantor, as applicable (and the
Guarantees and Liens will be limited so as to mitigate any risk of any of the foregoing) or
(B) to give rise to or result in any violation of applicable law, rule or regulation that, in each
case, cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the
Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary.

(b) The Guarantees and the Liens and the extent of their perfection (and the extent of legal opinions, title
insurance, surveys or other deliverables or formalities in connection therewith) will take into account
the cost (which term, for purposes of the Security Principles, shall include internal costs and the scope
of business disruption and administrative burden) to the Financial Group of providing the Guarantees
or granting, perfecting or maintaining the Liens (or providing or taking such deliverables or
formalities), as applicable, which shall not be disproportionate relative to the benefit accruing to the
holders of the Notes (taking into account, without limitation, the extent of the obligations that can be
guaranteed or secured and the priority that will be achieved thereby). In furtherance of and without
limiting the foregoing:

(i) No Guarantee will be required to be provided, and no Lien will be required to be granted or
perfected (and no deliverables or other formalities in connection therewith will be required to
be provided or taken), if or to the extent to do so would reasonably be expected to result in any
cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect of any Taxes) which is
disproportionate relative to the benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes (taking into
account, without limitation, the extent of the obligations that can be secured and the priority
that will be achieved thereby) (it being understood and agreed that the cost of providing a
Guarantee or granting, perfecting or maintaining a Lien shall in any event be deemed to be so
disproportionate (and such Guarantee or Lien, as the case may be, shall not be required to be
provided or perfected) if such cost shall exceed the realizable value of such Guarantee or Lien,
as the case may be).

(ii) Where there is a material incremental cost involved in creating Liens over all or any particular
assets owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor, the Liens to be taken and the extent of their
perfection will take into account the cost to the Financial Group in doing so, which shall not
be disproportionate relative to the benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes (taking into
account, without limitation, the extent of the obligations that can be secured and the priority
that will be achieved thereby).

(iii) Where a class of assets to be subject to a Lien includes material and immaterial assets
(including real property), if the cost of granting or perfecting Liens over the immaterial assets
is disproportionate relative to the benefit of such Liens accruing to the holders of the Notes
(taking into account, without limitation, the extent of the obligations that can be secured and
the priority that will be achieved thereby), Liens will be granted over the material assets only.

(iv) The maximum amount guaranteed or secured may be limited in a manner consistent with
current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction to minimize stamp duty,
notarization, registration or other applicable fees, Taxes and duties, in each case, where the
level of such costs, fees, Taxes and duties is disproportionate relative to the benefit to the
holders of the Notes of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount (taking into account,
without limitation, the extent of the obligations that can be guaranteed or secured and the
priority that will be achieved thereby).

(c) No Guarantee or Liens will be required to be provided by (i) any Unrestricted Subsidiary, (ii) any LC
Account Party, (iii) any Receivables Subsidiary or any other special purpose entity or bankruptcy
remote entity, (iv) any captive insurance company, (v) any not-for-profit Restricted Subsidiary, (vi) any
Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary, (vii) any Project Finance
Subsidiary or any Project Finance Entity, (viii) any Restricted Subsidiary organized under the laws of
an Excluded Jurisdiction, (ix) any of INEOS Belgium and its Subsidiaries, (x) any Rafnes Entity and
(xi) any Person that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date and that is prohibited by any
contractual obligation, or the Guarantee by which would require any approval or consent of any third
party, in each case which prohibition or requirement is permitted by the Indenture and is in existence at
the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary (so long as such prohibition or requirement is
not created in contemplation of or in connection with such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary).


-----

(d) [Reserved]

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Notes Documents:

(i) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected (in each case only for as long as, and to the
extent that, such circumstances exist) over any assets (other than Capital Stock in Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiaries) subject to third-party arrangements that are not prohibited by
the Indenture and that prohibit or restrict (including if the grant of a Lien created under the
Notes Documents would constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or
give rise to a right on the part of any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, any
contract or agreement governing such arrangement) those assets from being subject to such
Lien created under the Notes Documents and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected (in each case only as long as, and to the
extent that such circumstances exist):

(A) in respect of any asset owned or acquired by the Issuer or any Guarantor that is
subject to a Lien securing a purchase money, project financing, capital or finance
lease obligation or Acquired Indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to the
Indenture (or a refinancing of any of the foregoing) if the contract or other agreement
in which such security interest is granted (or the documentation providing for such
purchase money, project financing, capital or finance lease obligation or Acquired
Indebtedness or such refinancing) prohibits or restricts the creation of any other Lien
on such assets (including if the grant of any other Lien would constitute a breach or
default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a right on the part of any
party thereto to terminate or materially modify, such contract or agreement or such
documentation);

(B) in the case of any Capital Stock of any Person that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiary (including any Permitted Joint Venture), if such Lien is prohibited or
restricted (including if the grant of a Lien created under the Notes Documents would
constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of, or give rise to a right
on the part of any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, any such
document, contract or other agreement) by any organizational or governance
documents of such Person, any applicable shareholder or similar agreement or any
contract or other agreement governing Indebtedness of such Person; or

(C) with respect to any bank or securities accounts, or assets credited thereto, and any
cash, cash equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments that, in each case, are subject
to Permitted Liens securing any LC Facility, any bids, trade contracts, leases,
performance, surety, appeal or tax bonds or similar instruments or any other
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business (other than any Indebtedness
for borrowed money);

(ii) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected (in each case only for as long as, and to the
extent that, such circumstances exist) with respect to any Receivables Assets, or any Capital
Stock or assets of any Receivables Subsidiary, that are subject to Permitted Liens securing
obligations in connection with any Permitted Receivables Financing;

(iii) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any asset to the extent that, and only
for so long as, the creation of such Lien under the Notes Documents over such asset (A) is
prohibited or restricted by applicable law, rule or regulation or (B) requires a consent not
obtained from any Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable law, rule or regulation;
_provided that the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, shall use commercially_
reasonable efforts, to the extent consistent with current and customary market practice in the
relevant jurisdiction, to overcome any such obstacle or obtain such consent;

(iv) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any (A) bank or securities accounts,
and assets credited thereto, used solely to hold funds in trust for any director, officer or
employee of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan maintained by
the Parent or any of the Subsidiaries, (B) bank or securities accounts, and assets credited
thereto, the funds in which consist solely of cash earnest money deposits, deposits to defease
or to satisfy and discharge any Indebtedness or deposits under escrow or similar arrangements
not prohibited under the Indenture or that represent Escrowed Proceeds, (C) bank or securities


-----

accounts, and assets credited thereto, that constitute trust or fiduciary accounts and (D) bank
accounts used solely for collections of receivables under any Permitted Receivables
Financing;

(v) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any Intellectual Property, lease,
license or other agreement to the extent that a grant of a security interest therein is prohibited
or restricted under such Intellectual Property, lease, license or other agreement (including if
the grant of such Lien would constitute a breach or default under, result in the termination of,
or give rise to a right on the part of any party thereto to terminate or materially modify, such
Intellectual Property, lease, license or other agreement), in each case except to the extent such
prohibition or restriction is rendered ineffective pursuant to applicable law (including, where
applicable, Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 or 9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in
effect in the State of New York) or principles of equity;

(vi) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any Capital Stock of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(vii) with respect to any U.S. Obligor, no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any
intent-to-use trademark application prior to the filing of a “Statement of Use” or “Amendment
to Allege Use” with respect thereto, to the extent that the grant of a security interest therein
would impair the validity or enforceability of such intent-to-use trademark application under
applicable United States Federal law;

(viii) [Reserved];

(ix) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any Excluded Buildings; and

(x) no Lien will be required to be granted or perfected over any Capital Stock of any Project
Finance Entity or Project Finance Subsidiary;

in each case other than any proceeds of the foregoing (unless such proceeds would constitute
assets described in clauses (i) through (x) above or would otherwise be excluded from
Collateral pursuant to the Security Principles) (the foregoing being collectively referred to as
the “Excluded Property”).

(f) Except where such Liens may be created pursuant to a floating charge or other similar all-asset security
(including, in the case of clause (ii) below, a German law global assignment agreement and, in the case
of clause (iii) below, a German law security transfer agreement covering a defined security area
(Raumsicherungsubereignung)), no Lien will be required to be granted and, except where such Lien
may be perfected by filing of a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial Code (or a similar
unitary filing in any relevant jurisdiction) with respect to the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as
applicable, no Lien will be required to be perfected over:

(i) any Capital Stock owned by the Issuer or any Guarantor in any Restricted Subsidiary that is
not the Issuer or a Guarantor;

(ii) (A) any intercompany advance, balance or loan in a principal amount of €200,000 or less and
(B) any intercompany advance, balance or loan that is due or to be repaid or otherwise
discharged within 30 days of the making thereof;

(iii) any trucks, trailers, tractors, service vehicles, automobiles, rolling stock or other registered
mobile equipment or equipment covered by certificates of title or ownership (or the equivalent
thereof in any relevant jurisdiction);

(iv) any Intellectual Property that is not material to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or,
with respect to any Intellectual Property that is so material, (A) with respect to the granting of
such Lien, other than in the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor,
as applicable, or the United States and (B) with respect to the perfection of such Lien, other
than in the United Kingdom, the United States, at the European Community level or the
jurisdiction of the law governing the granting of such Lien;

(v) any right or interest in, to or under any Interest Rate Agreement, Currency Hedging
Agreement or Commodity Price Protection Agreement;


-----

(vi) any right or interest in, to or under any insurance policy, other than property damage, business
interruption, marine cargo insurance and, to the extent constituting property damage
insurance, contractors all-risk insurance policies;

(vii) any right or interest in, to or under any insurance policy that is not material to the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(viii) (A) bank or securities accounts, and assets credited thereto, used primarily for payroll, payroll
taxes, other employee wage and benefit payments and VAT and other taxes, (B) disbursement
accounts, (C) bank or securities accounts, and assets credited thereto, that are part of a cash
pooling arrangement of the Restricted Group, so long as the assets credited thereto are
transferred, on a regular basis, to one or more accounts that are either subject to a valid Lien
under the Security Documents or that are not required to be subject to such Lien in accordance
with the Security Principles and (D) any other bank or securities accounts (which are not
subject to a valid Lien under the Security Documents) held at any one or more banks or
securities intermediaries, provided, in the case of this clause (D), that the aggregate amount
held in such accounts by the Issuer and the Guarantors does not exceed €100,000,000 (or its
equivalent in any other currency) at any time (the “Cash Limit”), provided further that should
the Cash Limit be exceeded at any time, then such excess shall reasonably promptly be
transferred to a bank or securities account that is subject to a valid Lien under the Security
Documents;

(ix) any owned real property that is not a Material Real Property and any real property leasehold
interest; and

(x) with respect to any U.S. Obligor, any commercial tort claim as to which the applicable U.S.
Obligor has determined that it reasonably expects to recover less than €20,000,000 (or its
equivalent in any other currency) or any letter of credit rights (other than letter of credit rights
constituting supporting obligations).

(g) Perfection of Liens, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed (i) within the time
periods specified therefor in the applicable Notes Documents (subject to any extensions thereof where
the Company, acting reasonably, determines that such action cannot be accomplished without undue
effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be required to be accomplished by
the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other Notes Document) or (ii) if not so specified, as soon
as practicable but within the time periods specified by applicable law.

(h) Subject in each case to the Security Principles, each Guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and
downstream guarantee and, to the extent legally possible, the Issuer and each Guarantor shall create
first-ranking Liens over all assets of the Issuer or such Guarantor that are material, and each Guarantee
and Lien will be for all obligations of the Issuer or such Guarantor under the Notes and the Indenture,
as applicable, in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of each relevant jurisdiction.

(i) Where the Issuer or a Guarantor pledges specific Capital Stock or a specific bank account, the Security
Document will be governed by the law of the country of organization of the Person whose Capital
Stock is being pledged or the law of the country in which such bank account is located to the extent
necessary to ensure the perfection of such pledge.

(j) Where the Issuer or a Guarantor acquires assets of material value and/or significance after the date on
which it initially grants Liens under the Security Documents, the Issuer or such Guarantor, as
applicable, shall grant the Liens in accordance with the Security Principles in respect of such assets if
they are of a type over which, if owned on the Issue Date, Liens would have been created in accordance
with the Security Principles and to the extent that such assets are not subject to the existing Liens
created by the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable.

(k) No perfection action will be required with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor in jurisdictions other
than the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, or the jurisdiction of
the law governing the creation of the relevant Lien, other than in respect of Intellectual Property as set
forth in clause (f)(iv) of this paragraph and except that perfection action may be required in the
jurisdiction of organization of one Guarantor or the Issuer in relation to Liens granted by another
Guarantor or the Issuer organized in a different jurisdiction.


-----

(l) Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to take any action with respect to any Guarantee
or any Lien created under the Notes Documents as a result of any assignment, transfer or participation
by any holder of the Notes.

(m) In the case of any Person that becomes a Guarantor after the Issue Date, the application of the Security
Principles to such Guarantor will be made in a manner that is no less favorable to such new Guarantor
than the application thereof is to any then-existing Guarantor that is organized in the same jurisdiction
as such new Guarantor (or, in the case of a new Guarantor that is organized in a different jurisdiction
than any then-existing Guarantor, in a manner that is no less favorable to such new Guarantor than the
application thereof to the Guarantor on the Issue Date).

The following principles will be reflected in the Security Documents:

(a) The Liens will be first ranking, to the extent possible and subject to Permitted Liens and the Security
Principles.

(b) All Liens will be created (including, where necessary, pursuant to any “parallel debt” provisions or
similar) in favor of, and be enforceable solely by, the Security Trustee (including at the request or
direction of the Trustee), and not by holders of the Notes individually, in each case, except to the extent
otherwise required under applicable law or current and customary market practice in the relevant
jurisdiction.

(c) Except where it is inappropriate under applicable law, Liens will not be enforceable and will not
crystallize until notice of intention to enforce has been given by the Security Trustee following the
occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing.

(d) Subject to the limitations set forth in clause (p) of this paragraph or elsewhere in the Security
Principles, prior to the giving by the Security Trustee of a notice of intention to enforce its Liens
following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, the Issuer and each Guarantor shall,
subject to any restrictions required as a matter of law, or otherwise consistent with current and
customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction, (i) remain in possession and retain exclusive
control over the Collateral (including, in the case of any bank or securities accounts, the right to
withdraw or otherwise transfer any assets credited thereto and to close such account) and retain the
right to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and (ii) otherwise be free to deal with
assets and properties subject to the Liens (including by permitting any Intellectual Property that is not
material to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to lapse or expire or adjusting or compromising
any receivable), and exercise any voting rights related thereto.

(e) Prior to the giving by the Security Trustee of a notice of intention to enforce its Liens following the
occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, (i) no notice of any Lien over trade receivables,
Intellectual Property, lease, license or other agreement or any insurance policy shall be required to be
given to any debtor, counterparty or insurer, as the case may be, in each case, unless the giving of such
notice would be consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant jurisdiction, and
the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, shall remain entitled to collect any payments
thereunder, and (ii) no proceeds of any trade receivables shall be required to be paid into any blocked
bank account.

(f) (i) Prior to the giving by the Security Trustee of a notice of intention to enforce its Liens following the
occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall be entitled to
collect (and, if requested by the applicable insurer, the Security Trustee shall confirm to such insurer
the authority of the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, to collect) any payments under
insurance policies constituting Collateral and (ii) no loss payee or other endorsement will be made on
any insurance policy and neither the Security Trustee, the Trustee nor any holder of Notes will be
named as co-insured.

(g) To the extent such actions are consistent with current and customary market practice in the relevant
jurisdiction, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will be required to provide customary
notices of a Lien over its bank accounts to the applicable bank and to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain customary acknowledgements from the applicable banks (it being agreed, subject to
any other provision of the Security Principles, that (i) while such notice may request a waiver of any
Liens, rights of set-off or other rights that such bank may have, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor
shall be required to procure any such waiver, (ii) neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required
to close any bank account in respect of which the applicable bank fails to provide any such


-----

acknowledgements and (iii) neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to change its banking
arrangements or standard terms and conditions in connection with the granting of bank account
security). No control agreements will be required in respect of any deposit, securities or commodities
account located in the United States or Canada.

(h) Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to obtain any collateral access agreements,
landlord waivers, warehouse agreements or any similar agreements.

(i) No Liens will be taken over parts, inventory, moveable plant, equipment or receivables to the extent
that the creation or perfection of such Lien requires labelling, segregation or periodic listing, filing,
notification or specification of such parts, inventory, moveable plant, equipment or receivable. Subject
to the foregoing, where, under applicable local law, supplemental pledges or notices are required in
respect of future acquired assets in order to create or perfect a Lien over such class of assets, such
supplemental pledges or notices will be provided only upon request of the Security Trustee and, in any
event, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, no more frequently than once
in any calendar year.

(j) Subject to the Security Principles, to the extent practicable and consistent with the current and
customary market practice and applicable law in the relevant jurisdiction, Liens created under the
Security Documents will automatically create security over future assets of the same type as those
already subject thereto.

(k) The Security Documents will expressly provide that the proceeds of enforcement of any Liens granted
thereunder will be applied in the manner set forth in the Intercreditor Deed.

(l) Representations and covenants and undertakings in the Security Documents shall be strictly limited to
those necessary for the creation, perfection or maintenance of the security and shall not be included to
the extent that the subject matter thereof is the same as the corresponding covenant or undertaking in
the Indenture; provided that representations (which, if included, will in any event be given only as of
the date of the relevant Security Document), covenants and undertakings may be included to the extent
consistent with applicable law and current and customary practice in the relevant jurisdiction, in which
event such representation, covenant and undertaking shall be on the same terms as the corresponding
provisions in the Indenture.

(m) Without prejudice to, or the limiting of, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors as set forth in
the definition of Excluded Property, to the extent and for so long as any asset constitutes an Excluded
Property, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall have any obligation in respect of such Excluded
Property under any “further assurances” or similar covenants or undertakings set forth in the Security
Documents.

(n) The Security Documents shall not contain any rights of set-off, expense reimbursement or indemnity
provisions, provided that the Security Documents may include such provisions to the extent consistent
with applicable law and current and customary practice in the relevant jurisdiction, in which event such
provisions shall be in the form no less favorable to the Issuer and the Guarantors than the terms of the
corresponding provisions in the Indenture.

(o) Each Security Document shall expressly provide that (i) in the event of any conflict or inconsistency
between such Security Document and the Intercreditor Deed, the Intercreditor Deed will control and
(ii) nothing in such Security Document (A) shall restrict any action, transaction or other matter that is
permitted or not restricted under the Finance Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) secured
thereby (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding such Security Document) or (B) shall require any
additional notices or consents with respect to any such action, transaction or other matter (it being
understood that nothing in this clause (B) shall affect any such notices or consents required under such
applicable Finance Documents); provided that clause (ii) shall not apply to the extent that its
application would adversely affect the validity, ranking, priority or enforceability of the security
interest(s) created under such Security Document (other than any such security interests that, in
accordance with the Security Principles, would not have been required to be created).

(p) In respect of pledges of Capital Stock, the customary limitations on the exercise of voting rights
attaching to any Capital Stock pledged by any pledgor and on the right to receive and retain dividends
or other distributions on any Capital Stock pledged by them, in each case, to the extent these purport to
protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens over such Capital Stock shall apply. In addition,
until notice of intention to enforce has been given by the Security Trustee following the occurrence of


-----

an Event of Default which is continuing, the pledgors will be permitted to retain and to exercise voting
rights attaching to any Capital Stock pledged by them and to receive and retain dividends or other
distributions on any Capital Stock pledged by them, in each case, in a manner that does not adversely
affect the validity or enforceability of the Liens or cause an Event of Default to occur and the pledgors
will be permitted to pay dividends or other distributions upstream on pledged Capital Stock to the
extent permitted by the Indenture.

(q) The Security Trustee and the Trustee shall only be able to exercise a power of attorney granted to it
following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing or if the Issuer or the relevant
Guarantor, as applicable, has failed to comply with a further assurance or perfection obligation (after
the passage of any applicable grace period).

(r) Any security interest created for the benefit of any Second Secured Creditor (as defined in the
Intercreditor Deed) pursuant to any Security Document governed by the laws of the United States, any
State thereof or the District of Columbia must be created as a separate and distinct junior Lien from any
security interest granted for the benefit of any Priority Creditor (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed).

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Security Principles that would result in such Guarantees or such Liens not

being required (but subject to the other provisions hereof), (a) each Parent Intermediate Holdco shall be required to
provide a Guarantee and (b) the Parent and each Parent Intermediate Holdco shall be required to grant a Lien over the
Capital Stock of each Parent Intermediate Holdco and the Company.

Subject to the Security Principles, the Issuer and the Guarantors will be responsible for payment of all

registration costs, disbursements, taxes, notary fees and other costs (including the reimbursement for fees, disbursements
and other charges by counsel to the Security Trustee) incurred in implementing the Guarantee and security package
agreed upon in accordance with the Security Principles (including any of the foregoing arising in connection with a
resignation of an existing Security Trustee and an appointment of a new Security Trustee), it being understood and
agreed that, consistent with clause (l) of the first paragraph above, neither the Issuer nor Guarantor shall be responsible
for payment of any registration costs, disbursements, taxes, notary fees or other costs arising as a result of any
assignment, transfer or participation by any holder of the Notes or in case of voluntary registration in Luxembourg with
the Administration de l’enregistrement, des domaines et de la TVA of any of the Security Documents or of the
Intercreditor Deed by a holder of Notes or the Security Trustee where such registration, submission or filing is or was not
required to maintain, preserve, establish or enforce the rights of such holder of Notes or of the Security Trustee under any
Security Document or the Intercreditor Deed.

Extensions of time for the creation and perfection of security interests in, or the obtaining of title insurance,

legal opinions, surveys or other deliverables or formalities with respect to, particular properties or assets or the provision
of any Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary (including extensions in connection with assets acquired, or Restricted
Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Issue Date) may apply where the Company, acting reasonably, determines that
such action cannot be accomplished without undue effort or expense by the time or times at which it would otherwise be
required to be accomplished by the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other Notes Document.

Exceptions to any requirement to create or perfect security interests in, or to obtain title insurance, legal

opinions, surveys or other deliverables or formalities with respect to, particular properties or assets or to provide any
Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary (including exceptions in connection with assets acquired, or Restricted
Subsidiaries formed or acquired, after the Issue Date) may apply where the Company, acting reasonably, determines that
any such security interests or Guarantees would, under the Indenture and the other Notes Documents, be required or
permitted to be released and discharged reasonably promptly after the creation, perfection or provision thereof.

The application of the Security Principles will be by the Company, acting reasonably and in a manner which is

consistent with current market practice at the time.

Each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate of

the Company delivered to it in connection with the Security Principles as to any matter of fact or any determination to be
made under the Security Principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, amendments, supplements and other modifications to the Security Documents

contemplated by the Indenture shall be permitted as so contemplated.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

The Security Documents generally will only become enforceable after the Security Trustee gives notice of an

intention to enforce following the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Term Loans, an event of


-----

default under the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, an event of default under the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, an event of default under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, an Event of Default under the
Indenture or an event of default (or similar event, however described) under other Senior Secured Indebtedness which is
subject to the Intercreditor Deed. The Security Trustee will only be permitted to enforce the Security Documents in
accordance with instructions permitted to be given under the Intercreditor Deed and each relevant Security Document.

The Intercreditor Deed restricts the ability of the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security

Trustee to take enforcement action, and the Security Trustee will act only at the direction of creditors holding a simple
majority in aggregate principal amount of committed or funded debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the Notes, any
Additional Notes and any other Senior Secured Indebtedness incurred in the future will be able to instruct the Security
Trustee to enforce the security. For a description of security enforcement and other intercreditor provisions, please see
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed”.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority among (a) the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, (b) the Trustee and the

holders of the Notes, (c) the trustee under the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the holders of the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes, (d) the trustee under the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the holders of the
May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, (e) the trustee under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the holders of the
2025 Senior Secured Notes, (f) the Hedge Counterparties to the extent that they are owed Hedging Liabilities and (g) the
Cash Management Banks to the extent they are owed Cash Management Liabilities with respect to the Liens on the
Collateral that are created by the Security Documents and secure obligations under the Notes or the Guarantees and the
Indenture, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor Deed and the Security Documents, which will provide that
the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the Hedging Liabilities, the Cash Management Liabilities and the Notes
are secured equally and ratably by, subject to Permitted Collateral Liens, a first priority interest in the Collateral (or, with
respect to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security interests).

Certain Liens securing the Notes created under German and French law will, as a matter of local law, be granted

as junior ranking Liens in relation to the Liens in respect of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Nevertheless, the
Intercreditor Deed provides that as a contractual matter as among Senior Secured Creditors (as defined in the
Intercreditor Deed), the Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, certain
hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations and will be treated as such for purposes of the application
of proceeds from the enforcement of such Collateral.

The existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured

Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under New York,
Luxembourg and Norwegian law will remain in place and will extend to secure the Notes. In some jurisdictions, the
Security Documents creating the existing first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes will be amended to
extend such Liens (or, with respect to Belgian security, to confirm that these Liens extend) to the Notes (or, with respect
to French and certain German security interests, junior ranking security interests will be granted). The existing
first-ranking Liens securing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026
Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Jersey law, Scottish law
and Singapore law will remain in place, and new Liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to
secure the Notes. In these jurisdictions where new Liens are created, the ranking of these new Liens relative to the
existing Liens will, as a matter of general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the Liens, the order
of creation of the Liens, compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the Liens and the
order of giving notices with respect to the Liens, and accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new Liens would be
likely to rank after the existing Liens. However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the Liens
securing the Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will rank pari passu and will be treated as having equal priority with
respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any Collateral.

**_Release of Security_**

The Liens on the Collateral will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged, without any

action by, or the necessity of the consent of, the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the holders of the Notes, as follows (and
each holder of the Notes will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized the Trustee and the Security Trustee to execute
and deliver (and, at the request and cost of the Issuer, each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee will execute and
deliver) any document to the extent necessary or reasonably requested by the Issuer to evidence such release and
discharge):


-----

(a) in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of such Collateral (other than
Capital Stock in the Company) to a Person that is not the Parent, a Parent Intermediate Holdco, the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or, subject to the requirements of clause (iv) of the first paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”, to any other
Person that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, in each case, if such sale, assignment, transfer or other
disposition does not violate the requirements of the covenant set forth under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sale of Assets” or is otherwise permitted by the Indenture;_

(b) if such Collateral is an asset of any Guarantor (other than the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco or
the Company) or any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with any sale, assignment, transfer or other
disposition of Capital Stock of such Guarantor or such Subsidiary (or of the Capital Stock of any direct
or indirect parent company of such Guarantor or such Subsidiary, in each case, other than the Parent,
any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the Issuer) as a result of which such Guarantor or
such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, if such sale, assignment,
transfer or other disposition does not violate the requirements of the covenant set forth under “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets” or is otherwise permitted by the Indenture;_

(c) in the case of any Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
any Security Document or the Intercreditor Deed or any additional intercreditor agreement (which
release shall be of the Liens on the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor);

(d) in connection with any Permitted Receivables Financing (which release shall be of the Liens on the
Receivables Assets transferred in connection therewith);

(e) in connection with any inventory financing or similar arrangement incurred pursuant to clause (22) of
the definition of Permitted Indebtedness (which release shall be of the Liens on the inventory and
related assets transferred in connection therewith);

(f) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Unrestricted Subsidiaries” (which release shall be of the
Liens on the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary);

(g) with respect to the Collateral, upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge
of the Indenture as provided below under the captions “—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of
_Indenture” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(h) as described under “—Modifications and Amendments” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens”;_

(i) if the Lien granted in favor of each of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured Notes is released
(only to the extent that there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets constituting such
Collateral that would result in the requirement for the Notes and/or the Guarantees to be secured on
such property or assets pursuant to the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens”, it being understood that the foregoing limitation will not be applicable to the_
extent that such Indebtedness is secured by a Permitted Lien, provided that, for the purposes of this
provision only, clauses (a) and (bb) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” shall not apply and clause
(hh) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” shall not apply to any Indebtedness that was outstanding on
the Issue Date);

(j) in accordance with the Intercreditor Deed;

(k) in the case of any Collateral (other than any Capital Stock in the Company), upon written notice by the
Company to the Trustee and the Security Trustee if such Collateral is intended to secure
(A) Indebtedness incurred under Capital Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations or other
Indebtedness of the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the acquisition, development, construction or
improvement of real or personal, movable or immovable, property or assets (including Capital Stock)
used or to be used in the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, or any refinancing of
any such Indebtedness, or (B) Indebtedness incurred under lines of credit, bilateral facilities, working
capital or overdraft facilities or other operating facilities permitted to be incurred by the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”; provided that the Fair Market
Value of all the Collateral released since the Issue Date from Liens under this clause (k) (excluding any


-----

portion thereof to the extent Liens thereon are subsequently granted in favor of the Security Trustee, for
the benefit of the holders of the Notes, and with the Fair Market Value of any Collateral being
measured at the time of the release and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) does not
exceed €50.0 million in the aggregate;

(l) in the case of any Escrowed Proceeds, in accordance with the release provisions set forth in the
applicable Security Documents creating Liens thereon;

(m) with respect to Liens on any Proceeds Loan, upon the payment in full or other discharge of such
Proceeds Loan (including as a result of any merger or consolidation of the payor or the payee
thereunder);

(n) to release and/or re-take any Lien on any Collateral to the extent otherwise permitted by the terms of
the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Deed or any additional intercreditor
agreement;

(o) to the extent set forth in “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, in connection with any merger,
consolidation, amalgamation, sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer or other disposition made in
compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger and Sale
_of Assets”;_

(p) in accordance with “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests”;

(q) with respect to all Collateral, upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the
Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture;

(r) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(s) in connection with the funding of, or by, German pension trusts or in respect of sale and leaseback
transactions funded directly or indirectly by any such pension trusts;

(t) with respect to Liens on any Capital Stock of INEOS Belgium, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is
not a Guarantor, any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Project Finance Entity,
in connection with incurrence of Indebtedness by any such Restricted Subsidiary or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or by any such Project Finance Entity; or

(u) in the case of any Collateral, upon written notice by the Company to the Trustee and the Security
Trustee, if the release of the Lien on such Collateral is for bona fide purposes in connection with any
commercial transaction, so long as the Fair Market Value of the Collateral being released does not
exceed €2.5 million in the aggregate for any release or series of related releases;

_provided, however, that the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Trustee and the_
Security Trustee delivered prior to the automatic release and discharge of any Lien as specified above, to (A) waive such
automatic release and discharge of such Lien and maintain such Lien in effect until such time as the Company shall
instruct and direct the Trustee to instruct the Security Trustee in writing to release and discharge such Lien or (B) elect
that the release and discharge of such Lien shall not occur automatically as contemplated by this paragraph but shall
occur at such other time or times, in such manner and order and upon the occurrence of such other events as shall be
specified by the Company in such notice to the Trustee and the Security Trustee; provided further that nothing in this
clause (B) shall allow the Company to require the release and discharge of any Lien prior to (unless such release and
discharge is to occur substantially concurrently with) the occurrence of the applicable event(s) set forth in clauses (a)
through (u) above providing for the release and discharge thereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Notes Documents, the Issuer and each Guarantor may,

without any release or consent by the Security Trustee or the Trustee, take any action in the ordinary course in respect of
the Collateral not prohibited under the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Deed and the Indenture, including any sale,
transfer, assignment or other disposition of assets in the ordinary course of business. See “—Other”.

The Indenture will provide that any release of a Lien on Collateral may be evidenced, at the Company’s option,

by the delivery by the Company to the Security Trustee and the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate, and that the Trustee
and the Security Trustee shall, at the Company’s request, acknowledge and confirm receipt of such Officer’s Certificate
and the release of such Lien evidenced thereby.


-----

**_Other_**

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, and subject to certain exceptions required to ensure the Liens

securing the Notes and the Guarantees under the Security Documents are perfected, the Issuer and the Guarantors will
have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral, to collect, invest and dispose of any
income therefrom and to vote in relation to the pledged shares. The Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things,
without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Security Trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to
the Collateral, including, without limitation but subject to the covenant contained under the caption “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets”, (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, in any transaction or series of related_
transactions, any property and assets subject to Liens under the Security Documents which has become worn out,
defective or obsolete or no longer used or useful in the business, and (ii) selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of
assets in the ordinary course of business.

No appraisal of any of the Collateral has been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer, the Parent or the Company

in connection with the issuance of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral
remaining after sharing with other creditors entitled to share in such proceeds would be sufficient to satisfy the
obligations owed to the holders of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral will be able to be sold in a
short period of time, if at all. In addition, the Intercreditor Deed places limitations on the ability of the Security Trustee to
cause the sale of the Collateral, by reference to the interests of certain creditors, including holders of the Notes, lenders
under the SFA Loans, the holders of the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the May 2026 Senior Secured
Notes and the holders of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of
the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation.

The Indenture will provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have authorized the

execution and delivery of, and to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Deed.

**_The Notes Proceeds Loans_**

Upon the issuance of the Notes, the Issuer, as lender, and IHL, as borrower, will enter into the Dollar Notes

Proceeds Loan Agreement and the Euro Notes Proceeds Loan Agreement pursuant to which the Issuer will loan to IHL
the proceeds from the issuance of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes, respectively.

The Euro Notes Proceeds Loan will be denominated in euro and will be in an aggregate principal amount equal

to the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes. The Euro Notes Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least
equal to the rate required to enable the Issuer to make payments of principal, premium and interest (including Additional
Amounts and default interest) and any costs, fees and expenses under the Euro Notes. The Dollar Notes Proceeds Loan
will be denominated in dollars and will be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
the Dollar Notes. The Dollar Notes Proceeds Loan will bear interest at a rate at least equal to the rate required to enable
the Issuer to make payments of principal, premium and interest (including Additional Amounts and default interest) and
any costs, fees and expenses under the Dollar Notes.

The Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Deed and will provide

that IHL will pay the Issuer interest and principal due and payable on the Notes and, in each case, any Additional
Amounts due thereunder and any costs, fees and expenses. All amounts payable under the Notes Proceeds Loans will be
payable to such account or accounts with such Person or Persons as the Issuer may designate. The maturity date of the
Notes Proceeds Loans will be the same as the maturity date of the Notes.

The obligations of IHL in respect of the Notes Proceeds Loans will rank pari passu with the obligations of IHL

in respect of its guarantee of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the SFA Proceeds Loans, its Guarantee of the Notes, its
guarantee of the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, its obligations under the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Proceeds
Loan, its guarantee of the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, its obligations under the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes
Proceeds Loan, its guarantee of the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and its obligations under the 2025 Senior Secured Notes
Proceeds Loan. Except as otherwise required by law, all payments under the Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements will be
made without deductions or withholding for, or on account of, any applicable tax. In the event that IHL is required to
make any such deduction or withholding, it shall gross-up each payment to the Issuer to ensure that the Issuer receives
and retains a net payment equal to the payment which it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been
made.

The Notes Proceeds Loan Agreements will provide that IHL will make all payments pursuant thereto on a

timely basis in order to ensure that the Issuer can satisfy its payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture,


-----

taking into account the administrative and timing requirements under the Indenture with respect to amounts payable on
the Notes.

The Notes Proceeds Loans will be assigned by way of security to the Security Trustee for the benefit of holders

of the Notes, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes and the 2025 Senior Secured
Notes, the creditors under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Hedge Counterparties and the banks in respect of Cash
Management Arrangements as described in “Description of the Collateral and the Guarantees.”

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Euro Notes initially will be issued in the aggregate principal amount of €400.0 million and will mature on

May 15, 2028, unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The Dollar Notes initially will be issued in the
aggregate principal amount of $425.0 million and will mature on May 15, 2028, unless redeemed prior thereto as
described herein. The Indenture will allow additional Euro Notes (the “Additional Euro Notes”) and additional Dollar
Notes (the “Additional Dollar Notes” and, together with the Additional Euro Notes, the “Additional Notes”) to be
issued from time to time, subject to certain limitations described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness”; provided, however, that any Additional Notes that are issued with the same ISIN, common code or CUSIP_
number will be fungible with the previously issued applicable series of Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Each
of the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes will constitute a separate series of Notes. The Notes and any Additional Notes
will be treated as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase, except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture.

The Euro Notes will bear interest at the rate of 6.625% per annum and the Dollar Notes will bear interest at the

rate of 6.750% per annum, in each case, from and including February 16, 2023 or from and including the most recent
interest payment date to which interest has been paid, payable semi-annually in arrear on May 15 and November 15 in
each year, commencing on November 15, 2023. The Issuer will make each interest payment to the holders of record of
the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes on the immediately preceding May 1 and November 1. Interest on the Notes will accrue
from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the interest payment date it was most recently
paid. Interest on the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve
30-day months. Interest on overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, on overdue installments of interest will
accrue at the rate of interest borne by the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes, as applicable.

Principal of, premium, if any, any applicable Additional Amounts (as defined below) and interest on the Notes

will be payable, and the Notes will be exchangeable and transferable, at the office or agency of the Issuer in London
maintained for such purposes (which initially will be the corporate trust office of the Trustee). Principal, interest and
premium, if any, on the global notes (as described below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more
Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to Notes represented by one or more global notes registered
in the name of or held by a depositary common to Euroclear and/or Clearstream or a nominee of DTC, as applicable, will
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the holder or holders thereof. The
initial Paying Agent will be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch.

The Euro Notes will initially be represented by one or more global notes and will be issued in fully registered

form without coupons attached and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof. The Dollar Notes will initially be represented by one or more global notes and will be issued in fully registered
form without coupons attached and in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof. The global notes will be deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee or
with a custodian for DTC or its nominee, as applicable. Ownership of interests in the global notes, referred to as
“book-entry interests,” will be limited to Persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, or Persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-entry interests will be shown on, and
transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, and their participants. Please see “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

Settlement for the Notes will be made in same day funds. All payments of principal, any applicable Additional

Amounts and interest will be made by the Issuer in same day funds.

If the due date for any payment in respect of the Notes is not a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next

succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

When issued, the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes will each be a new issue of securities with no established

trading market. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Notes. Application has been
made for the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to
be traded on the Euro MTF Market thereof.


-----

On the maturity date, the Notes will be repayable at 100.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus

any applicable Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the maturity date
(subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date)

the relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest payment date). In determining whether the Holders of at

**_Selection and Notice of Optional Redemption_**

If less than all of any series of Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall

select the Notes of such series for redemption on a pro rata basis or by lot (or, in the case of Notes issued in global form
as discussed under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form”, based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata or by


-----

lot selection as Euroclear, Clearstream, DTC or such successor depositary, as applicable, deems fair and appropriate)
unless otherwise required by applicable law or applicable stock exchange or depositary requirements. None of the
Trustee, any Paying Agent, or the Registrar shall be liable for any selection made under this paragraph.

No Euro Notes shall be redeemed in part if the resulting Euro Note would have a minimum denomination that is

less than €100,000. No Dollar Notes shall be redeemed in part if the resulting Dollar Note would have a minimum
denomination that is less than $200,000. Notices of redemption shall be mailed by first class mail at least five but not
more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except
that a redemption notice may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or as specified in the next paragraph, in
each case in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. For Notes represented by global certificates held on behalf
of Euroclear and Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, notices may be given by delivery to Euroclear and Clearstream or
DTC for communication to entitled account owners in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

A notice of redemption shall state: the redemption date and the record date; the redemption price and the amount

of accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, to be paid; the paragraph of the applicable Notes
pursuant to which such Notes are being redeemed; the name and address of the Paying Agent; that the applicable Notes
called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any; that, unless the Issuer defaults in making the redemption payment,
interest, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the applicable Notes called for redemption shall cease to accrue on
and after the redemption date; if any series of Notes is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such
series of Notes to be redeemed; that the only remaining right of the holders of such series of Notes is to receive payment
of the redemption price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Notes; that, if less than all of any series of Notes is to
be redeemed, the identification of the particular Notes and the principal amount (or portion thereof) of such Notes to be
redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes to be outstanding after such partial redemption; whether the
redemption is conditioned on any events and, if so, a detailed explanation of such conditions; and that no representation
is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the ISIN, Common Code or CUSIP numbers, if any, listed in such notice or
printed on the applicable Notes. Subject to the satisfaction of any conditions precedent set forth in a notice of redemption,
Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. If such redemption is subject to the
satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the
Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or
waived (provided that in no event shall the redemption date be delayed to a date later than 60 days from the date of the
original notice of redemption, except that redemption notices may be given more than 60 days prior to a redemption date
if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture), and
the Issuer shall provide notice of the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions prior to the redemption date for any
conditional redemption, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed. On
and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the series of Notes, or the portions thereof, called for
redemption.

So long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are admitted to

trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so
require, the Issuer will inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of any such redemption and will publish a notice
regarding such redemption in a leading newspaper having a general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be
the Luxemburger Wort) or on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s official website, www.luxse.com.

**Redemption upon Changes in Withholding Taxes**

If, as a result of:

(a) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or treaties (or regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below under “—Payment of Additional Amounts”); or

(b) any change in the official application or the official interpretation or administration of such laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”), the Issuer, any Guarantor or any Surviving Entity
(as defined below under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”) would be obligated to pay, on the next date for
any payment, Additional Amounts, as described below under “—Payment of Additional Amounts”, with respect to the
Notes of any series which the Issuer, such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity cannot avoid by the use of reasonable
measures available to it (including, without limitation, making payment through a paying agent located in another
jurisdiction), then the Issuer or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, may redeem, at its option, all, but not less than


-----

all, of the Notes of the relevant series at any time on or after the Issue Date and following such Change in Tax Law, upon
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the relevant series of Notes, at a redemption price of
100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date.

In the case of the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction that is a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on the Issue

Date, the applicable Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum. In the
case of a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the Issue Date, the applicable Change in Tax Law
must become effective after the date that such jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.

Prior to the giving of any notice of redemption described in this section, the Issuer or the Surviving Entity, as

the case may be, will deliver to the Trustee in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee:

(i) an Officer’s Certificate of the Issuer, or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, stating that the
obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Issuer, such Guarantor or such
Surviving Entity taking reasonable measures available to it; and

(ii) a written opinion of independent legal counsel of recognized standing addressed to the Issuer or the
Surviving Entity, as the case may be, to the effect that the Issuer, such Guarantor or such Surviving
Entity has or will become obligated to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax
Law described above.

The Trustee will accept without further inquiry such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of

the satisfaction of the conditions to a redemption upon a Change in Tax Law, including any changes in withholding
Taxes, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on

which the Issuer or the relevant Surviving Entity or Guarantor, as the case may be, would be obligated to pay such
Additional Amounts if a payment were then due and (b) unless, at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay
such Additional Amounts remains in effect.

**Payment of Additional Amounts**

All payments by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Surviving Entity under or with respect to the Notes, or by or

on behalf of any Guarantor or any Surviving Entity with respect to any Guarantee, will be made free and clear of, and
without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes, unless such withholding or deduction is required by
law or by the official interpretation or administration of law, or by an applicable certification, identification, information
or other reporting requirement or agreement, if entering into or complying with such requirement or agreement is
required by law or by a taxing authority as a precondition to relief or exemption from such Tax. If any amount for, or on
account of, Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in which the Issuer, any Guarantor or, if
applicable, any Surviving Entity, is incorporated, organized, resident for Tax purposes or otherwise subject to Tax or
from or through which any payment is made on or with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee by any taxing authority
therein or political subdivision thereof (each, as applicable, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”) is required to be withheld
or deducted from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, the Issuer, such Guarantor or
such Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will pay such additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be
necessary to ensure that the net amount received after such withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount that
would have been received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Additional Amounts will be payable in respect of or on account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the holder’s or
beneficial owner’s present or former connection with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, including,
without limitation, the holder or beneficial owner being, or having been, a citizen, national, or resident,
being, or having been, engaged in a trade or business, being, or having been, physically present in or
having or having had a permanent establishment in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (but not including,
in each case, any connection arising from the mere holding of Notes or the receipt of payments
thereunder or under a Guarantee or the exercise or enforcement of rights under any Notes or the
Indenture or a Guarantee);

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by reason of the failure of the holder or beneficial owner of Notes
(or any financial institution through which the holder or beneficial owner holds the Notes or through
which payment on the Notes is made), following the written request of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any
Surviving Entity (as the case may be) made at a time that would enable the holder or beneficial owner
(or any such financial institution) acting reasonably to comply with that request and in accordance with


-----

the notice procedures set forth in the Indenture, to comply with any certification, identification,
information or other reporting requirements, whether required by statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of withholding or deduction of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a certification that the holder or beneficial owner is not
resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sale, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax that is payable otherwise than by withholding or deduction from payments made under or with
respect to the Notes or a Guarantee;

(e) any Tax that is imposed or levied by reason of the presentation (where presentation is required in order
to receive payment) of such Notes for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which
such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for,
whichever is later, except to the extent that the beneficial owner or holder thereof would have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had the Notes been presented for payment on any date during such
30-day period;

(f) any Tax that is imposed or levied on or with respect to a payment made to a holder or beneficial owner
of Notes who would have been able to avoid such withholding or deduction by presenting the Notes to
another Paying Agent in a Member State of the European Union;

(g) [Reserved];

(h) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the
Issue Date (or any amended or successor version of such sections), any regulations promulgated
thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to
Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code, any intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and
the United States with respect to the foregoing or any law or regulation implementing any such
intergovernmental agreement;

(i) any Tax that is payable in accordance with the Luxembourg law of 23 December 2005 (as amended)
introducing a withholding tax on certain interest paid to Luxembourg resident individuals; or

(j) any combination of items (a) through (i) above.

Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this section, Additional Amounts will not be paid with respect to the

Notes to a holder who is a fiduciary, a partnership, a limited liability company or any person other than the sole
beneficial owner of the payment under or with respect to the Notes, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect
to the fiduciary, a member of that partnership, an interest holder in that limited liability company or a beneficial owner
would not have been entitled to the Additional Amounts had it been the holder of the Notes.

The Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will (i) make such

withholding or deduction as is required by applicable law and (ii) remit the full amount withheld or deducted to the
relevant taxing authority in accordance with applicable law.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and

payable, if the Issuer, any Guarantor or a Surviving Entity will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to
such payment (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to the date on which
payment under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuer,
the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Surviving Entity (as the case may be) will deliver to the Trustee (with a copy to the
Paying Agent) an Officer’s Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee stating that such
Additional Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to
enable the Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to holders on the payment date. The Trustee shall be entitled to
rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Issuer, the relevant
Guarantor or the relevant Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will promptly publish a notice in accordance with the
notice provisions set forth in the Indenture stating that such Additional Amounts will be payable and describing the
obligation to pay such amounts.

Upon written request, the Issuer, the relevant Guarantor or the relevant Surviving Entity, as the case may be,

will furnish to the Trustee or to a holder of the Notes copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes by the
Issuer, such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity in such form as provided in the normal course by the taxing authority


-----

imposing such Taxes and as is reasonably available to the Issuer, such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity. If,
notwithstanding the efforts of the Issuer, such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity to obtain such receipts, the same are
not obtainable, the Issuer, such Guarantor or such Surviving Entity will provide the Trustee or such holder with other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or such holder.

In addition, the Issuer, any Guarantor and any Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will pay any present or

future stamp, issue, registration, court, documentation, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes, charges and duties,
including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by or in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in respect of the
execution, issue, enforcement or delivery of the Notes or any other document or instrument referred to thereunder (other
than on or in connection with (i) a transfer of the Notes other than the initial resale by the Initial Purchasers, (ii) the issue
of replacement Notes or certificated Notes pursuant to the Indenture or (iii) Luxembourg registration duties (droits
_d’enregistrement) payable due to a voluntary registration, submission or filing with the Administration de_
_l’enregistrement, des domains et de la TVA of any Security Document or the Intercreditor Deed by a holder of Notes or_
the Security Trustee where such registration, submission or filing is or was not required to maintain, preserve, establish
or enforce the rights of such holder of Notes or the Security Trustee under any Security Document or the Intercreditor
Deed).

Whenever the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” refers to, in any context, the payment of

principal, premium, if any, interest or any other amount payable under or with respect to any Note or with respect to any
Guarantee, such reference includes the payment of Additional Amounts, if applicable.

**Currency Indemnity**

The Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any Guarantor under

the Euro Notes and any Guarantee of the Euro Notes. Any amount received or recovered in currency other than Euro in
respect of the Euro Notes (whether as a result of, or as a result of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of
any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Parent, the Issuer, any Subsidiary of the Parent or otherwise) by
the Trustee or holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or any Guarantor of the Euro Notes
shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer or any Guarantor of the Euro Notes only to the extent of the Euro amount which
the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt
or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do so). If
that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any Euro Note, the Issuer and
each Guarantor of the Euro Notes, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such
purchase. For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for the holder to certify (indicating the sources of
information used) that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of Euro been made with the amount so
received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of Euro on such date had not been
possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible).

The Dollar is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer or any Guarantor

under the Dollar Notes and any Guarantee of the Dollar Notes. Any amount received or recovered in currency other than
Dollars in respect of the Dollar Notes (whether as a result of, or as a result of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of
a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Parent, the Issuer, any Subsidiary of the Parent or
otherwise) by the Trustee or holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or any Guarantor of
the Dollar Notes shall constitute a discharge of the Issuer or any Guarantor of the Dollar Notes only to the extent of the
Dollar amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on
the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it
is possible to do so). If that Dollar amount is less than the Dollar amount expressed to be due to the recipient under any
Dollar Note, the Issuer and each Guarantor of the Dollar Notes, jointly and severally, shall indemnify the recipient
against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this indemnity, it will be sufficient for the holder to
certify (indicating the sources of information used) that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of Dollars
been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of
Dollars on such date had not been possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible).

Each of the above indemnities will, to the extent permitted by law:

      - constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other obligations of the Issuer and any Guarantor;

      - give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

      - apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any holder; and

      - continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.


-----

**Sinking Fund**

The Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of any sinking fund.

**Open Market Purchases**

The Parent, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes

in the open market or otherwise.

**Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control**

If a Change of Control shall occur at any time, then each holder of Notes shall have the right to require that the

Issuer purchase such holder’s Notes in whole or in part (equal to €100,000 or $200,000, as the case may be, or an integral
multiple of €1,000 or $1,000, as the case may be, in excess thereof), at a purchase price (the “Change of Control
**Purchase Price”) in cash in an amount equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes, plus any Additional**
Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (the “Change of Control
**Purchase Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of record on relevant record dates to receive interest due on an interest**
payment date), pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) and in accordance with the other
procedures set forth in the Indenture; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase any series of
Notes as described under this caption “—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control” in the event and to the extent that
it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as described under “—Optional
_Redemption”. No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity of the Notes held by any holder to_
below €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes, or $200,000, in the case of the Dollar Notes.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee thereof and give written

notice of such Change of Control to each holder of Notes by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address appearing in
the security register, stating, among other things:

      - that a Change of Control has occurred and the date of such event;

      - the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control (including, but not limited to,
applicable information with respect to pro forma historical income, cash flow and capitalization after giving
effect to the Change of Control);

      - the purchase price and the purchase date which shall be fixed by the Issuer on a Business Day no earlier
than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, or such later date as is necessary to
comply with requirements under the U.S. Exchange Act;

      - that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest and, unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the
Change of Control Purchase Price, any Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date; and

      - any other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw
such acceptance.

The Issuer shall make available to the newswire service of Bloomberg (or if Bloomberg does not then operate,

any similar agency) or, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are
admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, a
newspaper having general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange’s official website, www.luxse.com, the notice described above.

The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number

of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would constitute an event of
default under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of
control under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture.
The future Indebtedness of the Issuer, the Parent and its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that
would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control.
Moreover, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause
a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
repurchase on the Issuer, the Parent and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the holders of the
Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by its and the Company’s then-existing financial resources. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.


-----

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the

Indenture are applicable, except, for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as
described under “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” has occurred or the Issuer has elected to exercise its option for Legal
Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as described under “—Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture,” in each
case prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the
Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem
the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder’s right to require the
Issuer to repurchase such holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from
seeking to acquire the Issuer, the Parent or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party

makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

The Paying Agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control

Purchase Price for such Notes and the Trustee will, in respect of the global notes, make such notations thereon as are
necessary to reflect the Notes (or interest therein) purchased in such Change of Control Offer, and the Paying Agent will,
in respect of certificated notes, cause to be authenticated and mailed to each holder a new certificated note or notes equal
in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new note will be in
a principal amount of €100,000 or $200,000, as applicable, or an integral multiple of €1,000 or $1,000, as applicable, in
excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on, or as soon as practicable
after, the Change of Control Purchase Date.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the

Company. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a
degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets of the Company. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the
Issuer must make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The Issuer will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange

Act, and any other applicable securities laws or regulations, including administrative interpretations thereof (including
those of the United States and the United Kingdom), in connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant (other than the
obligation to make an offer pursuant to this covenant), the Issuer will comply with the securities laws and regulations and
will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in this covenant by virtue thereof.

**Certain Calculations**

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or any other Note Document, solely for the
purposes of determining whether a Limited Condition Transaction may be consummated or any related
transaction, including the assumption or incurrence of any Indebtedness or Liens, may be consummated
in connection therewith, (i) each of the Parent’s Consolidated EBITDA, the Parent’s Consolidated
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Parent’s Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio, the Parent’s
Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and the Total Assets may, at the Company’s election,
be determined as of the last day of or for the most recent period of four full fiscal quarters for which
financial statements are available as of the date the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition
Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, in the case of any Acquisition or Investment made
pursuant to a tender or similar offer, as of the date such offer has been commenced or, in the case of a
Permitted Payment or Restricted Payment, as of the date of the declaration thereof or the date of the
delivery of irrevocable (which may be conditional) notice with respect thereto) (and shall not be tested
again on the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction or any related transaction, including
the assumption or incurrence of any Indebtedness or Liens, is consummated) and shall be calculated
giving pro forma effect to both the consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction and any
related transaction, including the assumption or incurrence of any Indebtedness or Liens; provided that,
following any such election by the Company with respect to any Limited Condition Transaction (and
which Limited Condition Transaction has not yet been consummated and with respect to which such
definitive agreement, tender or similar offer, declaration or notice has not been terminated or been
revoked without the consummation thereof), any subsequent calculation or determination (including
any subsequent calculation or determination made in reliance on this paragraph (a)) of any such ratio or
other metric shall be made giving pro forma effect to the consummation of such Limited Condition
Transaction and any related transaction, including the assumption or incurrence of any Indebtedness or


-----

Liens and (ii) any condition thereto as to the absence of any Default or Event of Default may, at the
Company’s election, be determined as of the date the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition
Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, in the case of any Acquisition or Investment made
pursuant to a tender or similar offer, as of the date such offer has been commenced or, in the case of a
Permitted Payment or Restricted Payment, as of the date of the declaration thereof or the date of the
delivery of irrevocable (which may be conditional) notice with respect thereto) (and shall not be tested
again on the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction or any related transaction, including
the assumption or incurrence of any Indebtedness or Liens, is consummated). For the avoidance of
doubt, in making any determination contemplated by this paragraph (a) as to any amounts in Dollars,
Euro or any other currency, it is understood that the Company may, at its election, select currency
exchange rates in effect (x) as of the last day of the most recent period of four full fiscal quarters for
which financial statements are available as of the date the definitive agreement for such Limited
Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, in the case of any Acquisition or Investment
made pursuant to a tender or similar offer, as of the date such offer has been commenced or, in the case
of a Permitted Payment or Restricted Payment, as of the date of the declaration thereof or the date of
the delivery of irrevocable (which may be conditional) notice with respect thereto), (y) as of the date
the definitive agreement for such Limited Condition Transaction is entered into (or, if applicable, in the
case of any Acquisition or Investment made pursuant to a tender or similar offer, as of the date such
offer has been commenced or, in the case of a Permitted Payment or Restricted Payment, as of the date
of the declaration thereof or the date of the delivery of irrevocable (which may be conditional) notice
with respect thereto) or (z) as of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction or such related
transaction, including the assumption or incurrence of any Indebtedness or Liens, is consummated.

(b) For purposes of determining Consolidated EBITDA, the Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Income Tax Expense, Consolidated Interest Expense, Consolidated Net Income (Loss),
Consolidated Non-Cash Charges, Consolidated revenues, Excess Proceeds, Net Cash Proceeds
(including for purposes of paragraph (b) under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments”) or any other financial ratio, basket calculation or financial_
measurement of any kind whatsoever of the Parent, the Company, the Financial Group or the Restricted
Group in respect of a period commencing prior to the date of completion of any Permitted
Reorganization and ending on or after such date, such determination shall be made using the results for
the applicable period prior to such date of the Parent, the Company, the Financial Group or the
Restricted Group as in effect during such prior period and the results for the applicable period on and
after such date of the Parent, the Company, the Financial Group or the Restricted Group as in effect
during such subsequent period. For purposes of each of clauses (1) and (2) under the first paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Provision of Financial Statements”, at any time
when the most recent fiscal year or fiscal quarter, as applicable, ended after the date of the completion
of any Permitted Reorganization and the comparable prior year period ended prior to such date, the
financial statements delivered in respect of such prior period may be those of the Parent as of the last
day of such prior fiscal year or fiscal quarter, as applicable.

(c) For purposes of determining the permissibility of any action, change, transaction or event that requires
a calculation of any financial ratio, Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets, Fair Market Value or any
other financial metric, such financial ratio or such other test shall be calculated at the time such action
is taken, such change is made, such transaction is consummated or such event occurs, as the case may
be (or, in each case, such other time as is applicable thereto pursuant to paragraph (a) of “—Certain
_Calculations”), it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that for purposes of determining_
compliance with any Consolidated EBITDA or Total Asset percentage restriction in connection with
any Acquisition or Investment, the amount of the Consolidated EBITDA or the Total Assets will be
determined after giving pro forma effect thereto, and no Default or Event of Default shall occur solely
as a result of a subsequent change in such financial ratio, Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets, Fair
Market Value or other financial metric, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”,
(i) in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness, or any Lien securing any Indebtedness, in
each case, in reliance on any exception set forth in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” that is based on a percentage of_
Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, the amount of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets shall be
determined after giving pro forma effect to the application of the proceeds of such Indebtedness (and
any other Indebtedness incurred substantially concurrently therewith), and any Indebtedness, or any
Lien securing any Indebtedness, in each case, incurred in reliance on any exception set forth in “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” that_
is based on a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets will be permitted to be refinanced


-----

under such exception (if otherwise complying with the requirements of such exception)
notwithstanding that, at the time of and after giving effect to such refinancing, the amount thereof
might exceed the applicable percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets and (ii) in the case of
any obligation to purchase or repurchase any inventory as part of any inventory financing or similar
arrangement, no Default or Event of Default shall occur solely as a result of a change in the Fair
Market Value of such inventory after the date of the initial incurrence of such obligation, and such
inventory financing or similar arrangement incurred in reliance on any exception set forth in “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens” will_
be permitted to be refinanced under such exception (if otherwise complying with the requirements of
such exception) notwithstanding that, at the time of and after giving effect to such refinancing, the
amount thereof might exceed the applicable cap set forth in such exception. For purposes of the
Indenture, whenever pro forma effect is to be given to any transaction or calculation, the pro forma
calculations will be as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Parent.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with
any of the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants” or “—Consolidation, Merger
_and Sale of Assets”, in the event that any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment,_
Investment, Asset Sale or other transaction (each of the foregoing, an “Item”) (or any portion thereof)
meets the criteria of more than one of the exceptions set forth under such captions (or in any applicable
defined term used under such captions), the classification of such Item (or any portion thereof) on the
date of its incurrence, making, undertaking or consummation under any such exception shall be made
by the Company in its sole discretion and the Company may, at any time or from time to time
thereafter, in its sole discretion, reclassify such Item (or any portion thereof) as having been incurred,
made, undertaken or consummated under one or more other exceptions set forth under such captions
(or in any applicable defined term used under such captions) if such Item (or such portion thereof) (i) at
the time of its incurrence, making, undertaking or consummation, would have been permitted under
such other exception or exceptions (but after giving effect to such other Item or Items (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, any other change in circumstance) that were incurred, made, undertaken or
consummated since such time in reliance on such other exception or exceptions) or (ii) solely in the
case of any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Investment, at the time of
such reclassification would have met the criteria set forth in such other exception or exceptions if then
incurred, made, undertaken or consummated and, in each case, such Item shall constitute a usage of any
availability under such exception only to the extent so classified or reclassified. In addition, the
Company may, at any time or from time to time thereafter, in its sole discretion, reclassify (or deem
such reclassification to have occurred automatically) any Indebtedness, Lien, Restricted Payment,
Permitted Payment or Investment (or any portion thereof), as applicable, previously incurred, made,
undertaken or consummated under any basket other than a “ratio-based” basket as having been
incurred, made, undertaken or consummated under any applicable “ratio-based” basket set forth in such
Section (or in any applicable defined term used in such Section) if such Item (or such portion thereof)
would, using the figures as of the last day of or for any period of four full fiscal quarters for which
financial statements are available on or after the date of such incurrence, making, undertaking or
consummation, be permitted under the applicable “ratio-based” basket. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Indebtedness incurred under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the SFA Loans to be borrowed in connection with the
Transactions) shall be deemed to have been incurred pursuant to clause (1)(A) of paragraph (b) of “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and may not be subsequently reclassified._

(e) For purposes of assessing whether any financial ratio or test set forth in any of the covenants described
under the captions “—Certain Covenants” or “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” (or in any
applicable defined term used under such captions) has been or would be complied with in connection
with any Item (or any portion thereof) incurred, made, undertaken or consummated in reliance on an
exception that requires compliance with such financial ratio or test, any other Item (or any portion
thereof) substantially contemporaneously incurred, made, undertaken or consummated, in each case, in
reliance on any other available exceptions that do not require such other Item (or such portion thereof)
to comply with such financial ratio or test (including, in the case of Indebtedness limited by
clause (1)(D) of paragraph (b) under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”, any other
sub-clause of such clause (1)) shall be disregarded (even if part of the same transaction and, in the case
of Indebtedness or Liens securing any Indebtedness, even if such other Item is Indebtedness of the
same tranche or series as such Indebtedness being incurred under such financial ratio or test); provided
that full pro forma effect shall be given to such other Item (or such portion thereof) for purposes of
determining any increase in the amount of Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets resulting therefrom.


-----

(f) For purposes of determining compliance with the Indenture, (i) the outstanding principal amount of
Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof shall be equal to the amount
thereof that would appear on a consolidated balance sheet of the Parent prepared in conformity with
IFRS and (ii) the accrual of interest, the accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest or a dividend in the form of additional
Indebtedness and/or any increase in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of any
fluctuation in the exchange rate of any applicable currency shall not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness and, to the extent secured, shall not be deemed to result in an increase of the obligations
so secured or to be a grant of a Lien securing any such obligations.

(g) Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Indenture, all terms of an accounting or financial nature
used therein will be construed in accordance with IFRS as in effect from time to time; provided that if
the Company, by written notice to the Trustee, shall request an amendment to any provision hereof to
eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the Issue Date in IFRS or in the application thereof
on the operation of such provision, regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such
change in IFRS or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of
IFRS as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such
notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance herewith and therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of any calculations pursuant to the Indenture (but not for
purposes of the financial statements required to be delivered pursuant to the covenant described under
the caption “—Certain Covenants—Provision of Financial Statements”), IFRS shall be deemed to treat
operating leases in a manner consistent with the treatment thereof under IFRS as in effect on January 1,
2018, notwithstanding any modifications or interpretative changes thereto that may have occurred or
may occur after such date.

(h) For all purposes under the Notes Documents, in connection with any division or plan of division under
Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right,
obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different
Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent
Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been
organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Capital Stock at such time.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants:

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

(a) The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, issue,
incur, assume or guarantee (collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including any Acquired
Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur
Indebtedness if, on the date of such incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including
giving pro forma effect to the use of the proceeds thereof, including, in the case of any Escrow
Indebtedness, upon the release of such Indebtedness from escrow), the Parent’s Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the most recent period of four full fiscal quarters for which financial
statements are available immediately preceding the incurrence of such Indebtedness is at least 2.00 to
1.00.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur each and
all of the following (collectively, the “Permitted Indebtedness”):

(1) Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries under Credit Facilities, including
such Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities outstanding on the Issue Date,
_provided that, with respect to any incurrence of such Indebtedness after the Issue Date, at the_
time of incurrence thereof and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including the use of
proceeds thereof, including, in the case of any Escrow Indebtedness, upon the release of such
Indebtedness from escrow), the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness under
this clause (1) shall not exceed the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness
outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement on the Issue Date (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the SFA Loans to be borrowed in connection with the
Transactions), plus (B) the greater of (x) €300.0 million and (y) 4.50% of Total Assets, plus
(C) the aggregate amount of fees (including original issue discount), underwriting discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with any refinancing of any


-----

Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1), plus (D) an additional amount so long as, in the
case of this clause (D), at the time of incurrence thereof and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including use of proceeds thereof, including, in the case of any Escrow Indebtedness,
upon the release of such Indebtedness from escrow), the Parent’s Consolidated Net Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the most recent period of four full fiscal quarters
for which financial statements are available immediately preceding the incurrence of such
Indebtedness is not greater than 3.00 to 1.00, provided that solely for the purpose of
determining Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio as set forth in this clause (D),
any Indebtedness incurred in reliance on this clause (D) shall be deemed to be (whether or not
it actually is) Senior Secured Indebtedness;

(2) [Reserved];

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer pursuant to the Notes (other than Additional Notes) and

(i) guarantees, Liens or obligations with respect to letters of credit, bank guarantees, bankers’
acceptances or similar instruments supporting Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of any such particular amount will be disregarded, (ii) in the case of any new
Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries the net proceeds of which are to be
applied to refinance any existing Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, the

occurred on the date of incurrence thereof, (iii) any Proceeds Loans made by a Parent Holdco or a
Financing Subsidiary with the proceeds of any Indebtedness incurred by such Parent Holdco or
Financing Subsidiary, which Indebtedness is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in accordance with this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, will be disregarded and
(iv) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bank guarantees, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments are incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to
clause (1), (12), (13), (21), (22) or (25) of paragraph (b) of this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”
covenant or pursuant to paragraph (a) of this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, then to the
extent such letters of credit, bank guarantees, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments support
other Indebtedness, such other Indebtedness will be disregarded.

(e) For purposes of determining compliance with this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant and the
“—Limitation on Liens” covenant:

(i) in the case of any exception requiring compliance with any financial ratio or test, to the extent
the committed amount of any Indebtedness has been tested, such committed amount may
thereafter be borrowed and, in the case of commitments of a revolving nature, reborrowed in
whole or in part, from time to time, without any further testing under this “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” covenant or the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Liens”,_
it being understood, however, that for purposes of any subsequent determination of
compliance with such financial ratio or test, such Indebtedness (other than, for purposes of
paragraph (a) under this “—Limitation on _Indebtedness” covenant, any Indebtedness that is_
revolving in nature) shall, solely to the extent of the reliance at such time on this clause (i)
with respect to such committed amount, be deemed to be outstanding;

(ii) any Escrow Indebtedness shall be deemed to be incurred on the date of the original incurrence
thereof (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not on the date of the release of such Indebtedness
from escrow or the date on which the obligor in respect of such Indebtedness becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary or transfers its assets to, or merges, consolidates or amalgamates with,
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Escrow Indebtedness that is redeemed pursuant to a special mandatory redemption or the
proceeds of which are not released to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary for any other
reason shall be deemed not to have been incurred by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary on the date of original incurrence thereof; and

(iii) such determinations and calculations in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction or
any related transaction shall be subject to paragraph (a) under “—Certain Calculations”
above.

(f) For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness where Indebtedness is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such
Indebtedness will be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided,
_however, that if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a_
Currency Hedging Agreement (with respect to Euro) covering principal amounts payable on such
Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in Euro will be adjusted to take into account
the effect of such agreement. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, if
incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be the Euro Equivalent of the


-----

Indebtedness refinanced, determined on the date such Indebtedness being refinanced was initially
incurred. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, if incurred in a different
currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, will be calculated based on the currency exchange
rate applicable to the currencies in which such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that
is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness” covenant, the maximum amount that the Company or any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, solely as a result of fluctuations in the
exchange rates of currencies (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such Indebtedness will be permitted to be
refinanced notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing, such excess will continue).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any determinations and calculations pursuant to this paragraph (f) in
connection with any Limited Condition Transaction or any related transaction shall be subject to
paragraph (a) under “—Certain Calculations”.

retirement and (y) any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to clause (7) or (8) of paragraph (b) of
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”) or (B) any Subordinated

the definition of such term, the payment of interest on Subordinated Shareholder Funding is
not subject to this clause (3));

rights to acquire shares of such Qualified Capital Stock or in Subordinated Shareholder
Funding); or

(5) make any Investment in any Person;

Investment (including by way of dividend, distribution, interest payment,
return of capital or other transfer of assets) to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary;

Restricted Subsidiary, the Fair Market Value of such Investment as of the
date such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; and

transaction or series of related transactions is entered into in good faith and:

(1) such transaction or series of related transactions is on terms that are no less favorable to the

such Disinterested Director and (B) a written opinion of an accounting, appraisal or
investment banking firm of international standing, or other recognized independent expert
with experience appraising the terms and conditions of the type of transaction or series of

engagement policies.

respect to such agreement or arrangement, which will cover all transactions entered into
pursuant thereto);

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create,

incur, assume, affirm or suffer to exist any Lien (the “Initial Lien”) of any kind securing any Indebtedness upon any
property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, including any Capital Stock or intercompany notes or
other Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary, owned on the Issue Date or acquired thereafter, or any income, profits or
proceeds therefrom, except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (i) Permitted Liens
and (ii) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Guarantees are, subject to the
Security Principles, directly secured equally and ratably or on a prior basis with the Indebtedness secured by such Initial
Lien (and if such Indebtedness so secured is Subordinated Indebtedness, on a senior priority basis) and (b) in the case of
any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens (for the avoidance of doubt, it being
understood that any Lien existing in reliance on clause (a)(ii) above shall not also be required to be a Permitted Collateral
Lien notwithstanding that the assets subject thereto shall have become Collateral).

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the preceding paragraph

of this covenant will, and will be deemed to, provide by its terms that such Lien will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged, without any action by the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the holders of the
Notes (and each holder of the Notes will be deemed to have irrevocably authorized the Trustee and the Security Trustee
to execute and deliver (and, at the request and cost of the Company, each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee will
execute and deliver) any document to the extent necessary or reasonably requested by the Company to evidence such
release and discharge), (a) upon the release and discharge of the applicable Initial Lien, (b) upon the sale or other
disposition of the property or assets subject to such Initial Lien (or the sale or other disposition of the Person that owns
such property or assets) in compliance with the terms of the Indenture, (c) with respect to the property or assets of, or the
Capital Stock in, any Guarantor that is encumbered by such Lien, upon the release of the Guarantee of such Guarantor in


-----

accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (d) with respect to the property or assets of, or the Capital Stock of, any
Restricted Subsidiary that are encumbered by such Lien, upon the designation of such Restricted Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, (e) upon effectiveness of any defeasance or
satisfaction and discharge of the Notes as specified in the Indenture, (f) in the case of any Lien on any Proceeds Loan,
upon the payment in full or other discharge of such Proceeds Loan (including as a result of any merger, consolidation or
amalgamation of the payor or the payee thereunder) or (g) as otherwise provided under the caption “—Brief Description
_of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of Security”; provided, however, that the Company_
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Trustee delivered prior to the
automatic release and discharge of any such Lien as specified above, to (i) waive such automatic release and discharge of
such Lien and maintain such Lien in effect until such time as the Company shall instruct and direct the Security Trustee
in writing to release and discharge such Lien or (ii) elect that the release and discharge of such Lien shall not occur
automatically as contemplated by this paragraph but shall occur at such time or times, in such manner and order and upon
the occurrence of such other events as shall be specified by the Company in such notice to the Trustee and the Security
Trustee (and the Trustee and the Security Trustee, at the request of the Company, shall execute and deliver any document
requested by the Company to effect and evidence the release and discharge of such Lien); provided further that nothing
in this clause (ii) shall allow the Company to require the release and discharge of any Lien prior to (unless such release
and discharge is to occur substantially concurrently with) the occurrence of the applicable event(s) set forth in clauses (a)
through (g) above providing for the release and discharge thereof.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the incurrence of any Lien

where the Indebtedness secured by such Lien is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Indebtedness
shall be the Euro Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided, however, that if any such
Indebtedness is Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency and is subject to a Currency Hedging Agreement
(with respect to Euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness
expressed in Euro shall be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this “—Limitation on Liens” covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness secured by any Lien that the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may incur pursuant to this “—Limitation on Liens” covenant shall not be
deemed to be exceeded, with respect to any outstanding Indebtedness, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the
exchange rates of currencies (and such Indebtedness will be permitted to be refinanced with other secured Indebtedness
notwithstanding that, after giving effect to such refinancing, such excess shall continue). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any determinations and calculations pursuant to this paragraph in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction or
any related transaction shall be subject to paragraph (a) of “—Certain Calculations”).

**_Limitation on Sale of Assets_**

(a) The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset Sale or series of related Asset Sales is
received (A) in cash, cash equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments or (B) in the form of
the assumption by the purchaser of liabilities of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (other than liabilities (or guarantees thereof) that are by their terms subordinated
to the Notes or Guarantees) as a result of which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
are no longer obligated with respect to such liabilities; and

(2) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset
Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the properties or assets subject to such Asset
Sale.

(b) Within 540 days after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale consummated after the
Issue Date, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may apply all or a portion of such Net
Cash Proceeds (at the option of the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary):

(1) to invest in properties and other assets (including Capital Stock) that (as determined by the
Board of Directors or senior management of the Company) replace the properties and assets
(including Capital Stock) that were the subject of such Asset Sale or in properties and assets
that will be used in or are related to the businesses of the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries existing on the Issue Date or prior to such Asset Sale;

(2) to either (i) purchase the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes or any other series of Additional
Notes issued under the Indenture pursuant to an offer to all holders of such series of Notes at a
purchase price equal to or greater than 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of purchase (a “Notes Offer”) and/or (ii) redeem


-----

the Euro Notes or the Dollar Notes or any other series of Additional Notes on a pro rata basis
pursuant to the redemption provisions set forth above under the caption “—Optional
_Redemption”;_

(3) to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or otherwise acquire for value (A) any Indebtedness
under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May
2026 Senior Secured Notes or the 2025 Senior Secured Notes (or, in each case, any Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) or (B) any Pari Passu Indebtedness that is
secured by a Permitted Collateral Lien on the properties or assets that are the subject of such
Asset Sale that ranks equal to or prior to any Lien thereon securing the Notes, any Guarantee
or the Indenture;

(4) to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or otherwise acquire for value Indebtedness that is (or,
immediately prior to such Asset Sale, was) secured by a Lien (other than a Permitted
Collateral Lien (except a Permitted Collateral Lien referred to in clause (k) of the definition of
such term)) on any of the properties or assets which are the subject of such Asset Sale;

(5) to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or otherwise acquire for value any Indebtedness of the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary that is not Pari Passu Indebtedness or Subordinated
Indebtedness; or

(6) pursuant to a binding commitment (including pursuant to an offer to purchase) to apply such
Net Cash Proceeds in a manner described in any of clauses (1) through (5) above; provided
that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of such Net Cash
Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (A) the date on which such
application of such Net Cash Proceeds occurs and (B) the 180th day following the expiration
of the aforementioned 540-day period.

The amount of Net Cash Proceeds not applied as specified above within such 540-day period shall
constitute “Excess Proceeds”. Pending the final application of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset
Sale, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, invest such Net
Cash Proceeds in Temporary Cash Investments or otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds for general
corporate purposes.

(c) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €100.0 million, the Company (or another
Restricted Subsidiary on the Company’s behalf) will apply the Excess Proceeds to the repurchase,
prepayment, redemption, repayment or acquisition for value of Indebtedness under the Notes and any
_Pari Passu Indebtedness secured by a Permitted Collateral Lien that ranks equal to or prior to any Lien_
on the applicable assets securing the Notes (which, solely for the purposes of this clause (c), shall be
deemed to include any Permitted Receivables Financing) outstanding with similar provisions requiring
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to make an offer to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or
acquire for value such Indebtedness with the proceeds from any Asset Sale as follows:

(1) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary will make an offer to purchase (an “Asset Sale
**Offer”) from all holders of the Notes in accordance with the procedures set forth in the**
Indenture in respect of an aggregate maximum principal amount of Notes (expressed as a
multiple of €1,000, in the case of the Euro Notes, or $1,000, in the case of the Dollar Notes)
(the “Note Amount”) equal to the product of such Excess Proceeds multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, and the denominator
of which is the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes and such Pari Passu
Indebtedness (subject to proration in the event the Note Amount is less than the aggregate
Offered Price (as defined herein) of all Notes tendered);

(2) to the extent required by such Pari Passu Indebtedness to permanently reduce the principal
amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be, will make an offer to repurchase, prepay, redeem, repay or otherwise acquire for
value such Pari Passu Indebtedness (a “Pari Passu Offer”) in an amount (the “Pari Passu
**Debt Amount”) equal to the excess of the Excess Proceeds over the Note Amount; provided**
that in no event will the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary be required to make a Pari Passu
Offer in a Pari Passu Debt Amount exceeding the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness plus the amount of any premium required to be paid to repurchase such Pari
_Passu Indebtedness; and_


-----

(3) the offer price for the Notes will be payable in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date (the “Offer
**Date”) such Asset Sale Offer is consummated (the “Offered Price”), in accordance with the**
procedures set forth in the Indenture.

To the extent that the aggregate Offered Price of the Notes tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer is
less than the Note Amount relating thereto or the aggregate amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness that is
repurchased, prepaid, redeemed, repaid or otherwise acquired for value in a Pari Passu Offer is less
than the Pari Passu Debt Amount, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may use any remaining
Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, including reinvesting in assets useful to the business
of the Restricted Group. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall select the
Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis, unless otherwise required by applicable law or applicable
stock exchange or depositary requirements. Upon the completion of the purchase of all the Notes
tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer and the completion of a Pari Passu Offer, the amount of
Excess Proceeds, if any, shall be reset at zero.

The Issuer, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Sale Offer
prior to the expiration of the 540-day period referred to in paragraph (b) above.

(d) If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary becomes obligated to make an Asset Sale Offer pursuant to
paragraph (c) above, the Notes and the Pari Passu Indebtedness shall be purchased by the Company or
a Restricted Subsidiary, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part (in a principal amount
of €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes, or $200,000, in the case of the Dollar Notes) or an integral
multiple of €1,000 or $1,000, as applicable, in excess thereof, such that no Euro Note of less than
€100,000 and no Dollar Note of less than $200,000 remains outstanding thereafter) on a date that is not
earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Asset Sale Offer is given
to holders, or such later date as may be necessary for the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to
comply with the requirements under the U.S. Exchange Act or other applicable laws or regulations
(including, without limitation, those of any securities exchange on which the Notes are listed).

(e) If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary is required to make an Asset Sale Offer or makes a Notes
Offer, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, will comply with the applicable
tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act, and any other applicable
securities laws or regulations, including administrative interpretations thereof (including those of the
United States and the United Kingdom, to the extent applicable), in connection with such Asset Sale
Offer or Notes Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations
conflict with the provisions of this covenant (other than the obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer
pursuant to this covenant), the Company and such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, will
comply with the securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in this covenant by virtue thereof.

(f) If the Offer Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date,
any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the
close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders of the Notes
who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer or Notes Offer.

(g) Compliance with paragraph (a) of this covenant shall be determined as of the date of consummation of
the applicable Asset Sale, without giving effect to any post-closing purchase price adjustments not then
determined, and for purposes of sub-clause (1) thereof, the following will be deemed to be cash:

(1) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash, cash equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments within 180 days following the closing
of such Asset Sale;

(2) liabilities of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Sale, provided that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company are released from any guarantee of payment of such liabilities in connection with
such Asset Sale;


-----

(3) consideration consisting of liabilities of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons that are not the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) any properties and assets (including Capital Stock of a business) of the kind referred to in
clause (b)(1) above; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all
other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that
time outstanding, not to exceed (for the avoidance of doubt, with the Fair Market Value of
each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of (x) €475.0 million and
(y) 5.00% of Total Assets.

**_Limitation on Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(a) The Company will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary (which is not a Guarantor or the
Issuer), directly or indirectly, to guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor under
any Credit Facilities or (ii) any Public Debt (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any guarantee of
Public Debt) of the Issuer or any Guarantor, in each case, unless such Restricted Subsidiary (if not the
Issuer or a Guarantor) simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to the Indenture
providing for a Guarantee of the Notes on the same terms (subject to any applicable Guarantee
limitations) as the other Guarantees of the Notes by the Guarantors; provided that:

(1) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee of Indebtedness that existed at the
time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the guarantee was not incurred in
connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee in connection with a Permitted
Receivables Financing or any inventory financing or similar arrangement;

(3) such Guarantee need not be secured unless required pursuant to the “—Limitation on Liens”
covenant;

(4) if such Indebtedness is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Notes or any Guarantee, any
such guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary of such Indebtedness shall be subordinated to
such Restricted Subsidiary’s Guarantee of the Notes at least to the same extent as such
Indebtedness is subordinated to the Notes or any other Guarantee;

(5) no Guarantee shall be required as a result of any guarantee given in connection with any Cash
Management Arrangement of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(6) no Guarantee shall be required under this covenant if such Guarantee would not be required
under the Security Principles, including if such Guarantee could reasonably be expected to
give rise to or result in (A) personal, whether civil or criminal, liability for any officers,
directors, legal representatives or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary, (B) any violation
of applicable law that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably
available to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or (C) any significant cost, expense,
liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of
pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
governmental or regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to
clause (B) undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee, which cannot be avoided through
measures reasonably available to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (it being
understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the cost of providing a Guarantee shall in any
event be deemed to be significant and unreasonable (and such Guarantee shall not be required
to be provided) if the cost shall exceed the realizable value of such Guarantee); and

(7) each such Guarantee will be limited as set forth in or contemplated by the Indenture and the
Security Principles, including as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, rules


-----

or regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company created
pursuant to paragraph (a) above will be deemed to provide by its terms that it shall be automatically
and unconditionally released and discharged, without any action by the Trustee, the Security Trustee or
the holders of the Notes, upon:

(1) any sale, exchange or transfer, directly or indirectly, to any Person that is not the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, of all of the Capital Stock held by the Company and other
Restricted Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the assets of, such Restricted Subsidiary
(which sale, exchange or transfer is not prohibited by the Indenture) and such Restricted
Subsidiary is released from all guarantees, if any, by it of other Credit Facilities and Public
Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) with respect to any Guarantee created after the Issue Date, the release by the holders of the
Credit Facilities and Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor described in paragraph (a)
above of their guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary at such time as (A) no other Credit
Facility or Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor has been guaranteed by such Restricted
Subsidiary or (B) the holders of all other Credit Facilities and Public Debt of the Issuer or any
Guarantor which is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary also release their guarantee by
such Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) any defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in “—Defeasance or Covenant
_Defeasance of Indenture” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge”; or_

(4) the satisfaction of the requirements of any of the other provisions described under the caption
“—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—The Guarantees—
_Release of the Guarantees”;_

_provided, however, that the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the_
Trustee delivered prior to the automatic release and discharge of any such Guarantee as specified
above, to (A) waive such automatic release and discharge of such Guarantee and maintain such
Guarantee in effect until such time as the Company shall instruct and direct the Trustee in writing to
release and discharge such Guarantee or (B) elect that the release and discharge of such Guarantee shall
not occur automatically as contemplated by this paragraph (b) but shall occur at such time or times, in
such manner and order and upon the occurrence of such other events as shall be specified by the
Company in such notice to the Trustee (and the Trustee, at the request of the Company, shall execute
and deliver any document requested by the Company to effect and evidence the release of such
Guarantee); provided further that nothing in this clause (B) shall allow the Company to require the
release and discharge of any Guarantee prior to (unless such release and discharge is to occur
substantially concurrently with) the occurrence of the applicable event(s) set forth in clauses (1)
through (4) above providing for the release and discharge thereof.

**_Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(a) The Company will not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or
indirectly, create or otherwise cause to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distribution on its Capital Stock or any other interest or
participation in, or measured by, its profits to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(4) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) any Indebtedness owed to the Company or


-----

any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph (a) above, the provisions of such paragraph will
not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (A) the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement,
any LC Facility, the March 2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the May 2026 Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Indenture, other
Senior Secured Notes Documents (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), any High Yield
Documents, the Intercreditor Deed, the Proceeds Loans Documents and the other Notes
Documents, (B) any other agreement in effect on the Issue Date and (C) any indenture for any
Public Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company on the Issue Date in existence at the time such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and not incurred in connection with, or in
contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such
encumbrances and restrictions are not applicable to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
or the properties or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary other than such Person
(and its properties or assets or Capital Stock) that is becoming a Restricted Subsidiary;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating
to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person which is assumed by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary in connection with any Acquisition or any other acquisition of assets
(other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any
portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions
pursuant to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into such acquisition)
and outstanding on the date of consummation of such acquisition, which encumbrance or
restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than
the Person, or property or assets or Capital Stock of the Person, so acquired;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction under the Indenture, the Notes (including Additional Notes)
and any other Notes Documents;

or a Lien on any property or assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary not otherwise

(D) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth
in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or (E) in
respect of Intellectual Property contained in licenses or sublicenses of, or other grants of rights
to use or exploit, such Intellectual Property;

(7) any encumbrances or restrictions pursuant to contracts for the sale of assets, including any
encumbrance or restriction with respect to any Restricted Subsidiary imposed pursuant to an
agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Capital Stock
or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or disposition as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the senior management of the Company;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses and other agreements restricting the assignment
thereof;

(9) any encumbrances or restrictions created under any agreement (A) with respect to
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions


-----

of the covenant described under the caption “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes
than those contained in the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the Indenture, the March
2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
2025 Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in each case, on the Issue Date or in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) or (ii) the Company determines at
the time of the incurrence of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
materially adversely affect the ability of the Issuer to make principal or interest payments on
the Notes or (B) constituting an additional intercreditor agreement entered into in compliance
with the covenant described under “—Intercreditor Deed; Additional Intercreditor
_Agreements”;_

(10) any encumbrances or restrictions required by any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any of their businesses;

(11) in the case of (A) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary
or (B) the Capital Stock in any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary (including any
Unrestricted Subsidiary), encumbrances and restrictions imposed by the organizational
documents of such Restricted Subsidiary or such other Person or contained in any related joint
venture, shareholders’ or similar agreement or in any agreement or instrument relating to
Indebtedness of such Person; provided that such encumbrances and restrictions apply only to
such Restricted Subsidiary (and its properties and assets) and/or to any Capital Stock in such
Restricted Subsidiary or such other Person; provided further that the Company determines that
such encumbrances or restrictions will not materially adversely affect the ability of the Issuer
to make principal or interest payments on the Notes;

(12) encumbrances or restrictions existing by reason of any Lien permitted under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Liens”;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed under leases,
agreements with customers entered into in the ordinary course of business or other agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations or Cash Management
Arrangements;

management of the Company, is necessary or advisable to effect such Permitted Receivables
Financing and (B) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with any inventory
financing or similar arrangement that, in the good faith determination of the Board of
Directors or senior management of the Company, is necessary or advisable to effect such
inventory financing or similar arrangement;

(16) contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, not relating to Indebtedness, and that
do not, individually or in the aggregate, (A) detract from the value of property or assets of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company in any manner material to the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (B) materially adversely affect
the ability of the Issuer to make principal or interest payments in respect of the Notes; or

(17) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any agreement that extends, renews, refinances
or replaces the agreements containing the encumbrances or restrictions in the foregoing
clauses (1) through (16) or in this clause (17); provided that the terms and conditions of any
such encumbrances or restrictions are no more restrictive in any material respect than those
under or pursuant to the agreement so extended, renewed, refinanced or replaced, as
determined by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company in good faith.

**_Limitation on Layered Debt_**

The Company and the Issuer will not, and the Company will not permit any other Guarantor to, directly or

indirectly, incur or otherwise permit to exist any Indebtedness (including Permitted Indebtedness) that is contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as the case may be, unless
such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the applicable Guarantor’s


-----

Guarantee on reasonably similar terms (or, for the avoidance of doubt, on terms consistent with the provisions of the
Intercreditor Deed); provided, however, that no Indebtedness consisting of, or Indebtedness consisting of guarantees of,
Second Secured Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) incurred after the Issue Date shall be subject to the
limitations set forth in this covenant; and provided further, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be subordinated in
right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue
of being secured with different collateral, by virtue of being secured on a first or junior priority basis, by virtue of claims
with respect thereto being subject to a waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of
Indebtedness or by virtue of not being guaranteed. In addition, junior liens, second liens and other contractual
arrangements that provide for priorities among holders of the same or different issues of Indebtedness with respect to any
collateral or the proceeds of collateral or tranching of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities shall not constitute
subordination in right of payment.

**_Limitation on Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate after the Issue Date (a “Designation”) any Subsidiary of the Company (other than

the Issuer) as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the Indenture; provided that:

(a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of or after giving
effect to such Designation or would occur as a consequence of such Designation;

(b) either (i) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total assets of €1,000 or less or (ii) the Company would
be permitted to make a Restricted Payment, Permitted Payment or Permitted Investment at the time of
such Designation (assuming the effectiveness of such Designation) pursuant to the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” in an amount (the “Designation Amount”) equal to the
greater of (1) the net book value of the Company’s interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance
with IFRS and (2) the Fair Market Value of the Company’s interest in such Subsidiary;

(c) such Subsidiary does not own directly or indirectly any Capital Stock of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company which is not simultaneously being designated an Unrestricted
Subsidiary; and

(d) such Subsidiary is not a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding at the time of
such Designation with the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than any Restricted Subsidiary
that is to be simultaneously designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary) unless (i) the terms of any such
agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding are no less favorable in any material respect to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that might be obtained at the time from Persons that
are not Affiliates of the Company or would be permitted under the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates” or (ii) to the extent the requirements of clause (i) above are_
not satisfied, the value of such agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding to such Unrestricted
Subsidiary (to the extent, for the avoidance of doubt, not already included in the Designation Amount)
shall be deemed a Restricted Payment.

For purposes of the foregoing, the Designation of a Subsidiary of the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary

shall be deemed to be the Designation of all of the Subsidiaries of such Subsidiary as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

In the event of any Designation, unless sub-clause (i) of clause (b) of the first paragraph of this covenant applies,

the Company will be deemed to have made an Investment in an amount equal to the Designation Amount.

The Company will not and will not cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a guarantee of, or

subject any of its property or assets (other than the Capital Stock of any Unrestricted Subsidiary) to the satisfaction of,
any Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, in each case, except to the extent permitted under the covenants
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Company may redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary (a “Redesignation”) if:

(a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of and after giving
effect to such Redesignation or would occur as a consequence of such Redesignation; and

(b) all Liens and Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary outstanding immediately following such
Redesignation would, if incurred at such time, have been permitted to be incurred for all purposes of
the Indenture.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent and the Company will not, and the Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or

knowingly or negligently omit to take any action which action or omission would have the result of materially impairing
the security interests with respect to the Collateral for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the
Parent and the Company shall not, and the Company shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person
other than the Security Trustee or the Trustee, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any Lien whatsoever on any of the Collateral, in each case, except as
otherwise permitted by the Indenture (including pursuant to the following paragraph or as described under “—Suspension
_of Covenants and Release of Guarantees on Achievement of Investment Grade Status” or “Brief Description of the Notes,_
_the Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of Security”) or the Security Documents, including (i) the grant of_
any Permitted Collateral Liens or any other Lien that is not prohibited by the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Liens”, (ii) the implementation of any transaction that is subject to the covenant described under the caption “—_
_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” and is completed in compliance therewith, (iii) the implementation of any_
transaction as part of a Permitted Reorganization and (iv) any sale, transfer or other disposition of Collateral that is
permitted by the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sale of Assets” or that does not constitute an Asset Sale
under the definition thereof; provided that in the case of any sale, transfer or other disposition, other than in the ordinary
course of business, by the Issuer or any Guarantor to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of any assets that
constitute Collateral and that are material to the business and operations of the Issuer or such Guarantor, unless (A) the
transferee thereof would be permitted, were it a Guarantor, to be released from its Guarantee pursuant to clause (a), (b),
(c), (d) and (g) under the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Release of the
_Guarantees”, (B) the transferee thereof would be permitted, were it a Guarantor, to be released from its Guarantee_
pursuant to clause (i) under the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Release of
_the Guarantees” if the calculations set forth therein were redetermined on a pro forma basis to give effect to such sale,_
transfer or other deposition or (C) the release of Liens on such assets would be permitted under clause (d), (e), (f), (k),
(s), (t) or (u) under the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of
_Security”, then either the transferee thereof shall have granted or shall grant, substantially concurrently with such sale,_
transfer or other disposition, a Lien on such Collateral to the Security Trustee for the benefit of the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes or an existing Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Security Trustee for the benefit of the Trustee
and the holders of the Notes shall remain in effect immediately after such sale, transfer or other disposition, subject to
any subsequent release thereof as provided under the caption “—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the
_Security—Security—Release of Security”._

At the request of the Company from time to time, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall, and will be deemed

to have been irrevocably authorized and directed by the holders of the Notes to, in each case on behalf of such holders
and without any further consent, authorization or other action by such holders, execute and deliver one or more
amendments, supplements or other modifications to the Security Documents to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein or reflect changes of a minor, technical or
administrative nature;

(ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens;

(iii) add to the Collateral;

(iv) make any change necessary or desirable, in the good faith determination of the Board of Directors or
senior management of the Company, in order to implement any transaction that is subject to, and is
completed in compliance with, the covenant described under the caption “—Consolidation, Merger and
_Sale of Assets”;_

(v) implement any transaction as part of a Permitted Reorganization (including any such change to any
Security Document to provide for upstream security and guarantees or security and guarantees over or
in favor of Proceeds Loans);

(vi) provide for the release of any properties and assets constituting Collateral from the Liens created under
the Security Documents; provided that such release is followed by the substantially concurrent (as
determined in good faith by the Company, it being agreed that in making such determination the
Company may take into account the occurrence of any related transactions and that the re-taking need
not occur on the same day as the release) re-taking (irrespective of the Security Principles) of a Lien in
favor of the Security Trustee, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, securing the
Notes and/or the applicable Guarantees, as the case may be, on such properties or assets of at least
equivalent priority (subject to any Liens thereon permitted under the Indenture); provided further that,
in the case of this clause (vi), the Company will deliver to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion, in


-----

form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an accounting, appraisal or investment
banking firm of national standing confirming the solvency of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions relating to such release and/or
re-taking, (2) a certificate substantially in the form of an exhibit attached to the Indenture from the
chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the Company (acting in good faith) which confirms
the solvency of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to
any transactions relating to such release and re-taking or (3) an opinion of counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary exceptions and qualifications),
confirming that, after giving effect to any such transactions, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes and/or
the applicable Guarantees created under the applicable Security Documents are valid and perfected
Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
to which such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject immediately prior to such release and re-taking;

(vii) (A) provide for the release of the Liens on any Proceeds Loans upon the payment in full or other
discharge or repurchase or redemption of such Proceeds Loans (including as a result of any merger,
consolidation or amalgamation of the payor or the payee thereunder) (and the release of the Liens on
any amounts so repaid or discharged) or (B) with respect to any repayment, defeasance, satisfaction,
cancellation or other discharge of all or any portion of the underlying Indebtedness giving rise to any
Proceeds Loans, provide for the repayments, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or other discharge of
such Proceeds Loans, provided that any amount remaining under such Proceeds Loan after such
repayments, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or discharge remains subject to a valid Lien;

(viii) make any other change to the Security Documents to provide for additional Indebtedness (which may
be Pari Passu Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness) or other obligations that are permitted by
the terms of the Indenture to be secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a senior, pari passu or junior
basis with the Liens securing the Notes or the Guarantees, including changes to the definition of the
term “Secured Obligations” in the Security Documents (or any other term, however described, relating
to the obligations of the Company, the Guarantors and the Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that
are subject to the security interest created therein); provided that, in the case of this clause (viii), the
Company shall deliver to the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee from an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
standing confirming the solvency of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to any transactions relating to such change, (2) a certificate substantially in the form
of an exhibit attached to the Indenture from the chief financial officer or the Board of Directors of the
Company (acting in good faith) which confirms the solvency of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the transactions relating to such change or (3) an
opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (subject to customary
exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to the transactions relating to such
change, the Lien or Liens securing the Notes and/or the applicable Guarantees created under the
applicable Security Documents are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject immediately prior to such transactions;

(ix) amend or otherwise modify any Security Document to the extent necessary (A) to conform any
restriction or limitation contained therein to any analogous restriction or limitation contained in the
Indenture or to eliminate any restriction or limitation therein that is not contained in the Indenture
except to the extent such restriction or limitation is necessary to create, perfect, preserve or enforce the
security interest in the Collateral purported to be created by such Security Document, (B) to conform to
the Security Principles or the security principles under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement
(“SFA Security Principles”) (including any amendment or other modification to exclude from the
Liens created or purported to be created by such Security Document any assets that, in accordance with
the Security Principles or the SFA Security Principles, would not or would no longer be required to be
subject to such Liens (it being understood and agreed that such exclusion may provide that its
effectiveness is delayed until the satisfaction of any requirement set forth on the Security Principles or
the SFA Security Principles that must be satisfied in order for such assets to not be required, in
accordance with the Security Principles or the SFA Security Principles, to be subject to such Liens)),
(C) to amend, supplement or modify any one or more Security Documents to eliminate or reduce
administrative burdens imposed on the Parent, the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries by
(i) eliminating, reducing the frequency of or delaying the timing of notices or other informational
requirements, (ii) limiting representations and covenants and undertakings in the Security Documents
to those necessary for the creation, perfection or maintenance of the security and excluding such
representations and covenants and undertakings to the extent that the subject matter thereof is the same
as the corresponding covenant or undertaking in the Indenture or the Senior Secured Term Loans


-----

Agreement; provided that (x) representations (to the extent included) need only be given as of the date
of the relevant Security Document and (y) representations, covenants and undertakings may be
included to the extent consistent with applicable law and current and customary practice in the relevant
jurisdiction, in which event such representation, covenant and undertaking shall be on the same terms
as the corresponding provisions in the Indenture or the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, and
(iii) eliminating restrictions on any action, transaction or other matter that is permitted or not restricted
under the Notes Documents (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding such Security Document) and any
required additional notices or consents with respect to any such action, transaction or other matter (it
being understood that nothing in this clause (iii) shall affect any such notices or consents required
under such applicable Notes Documents); provided that each of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not apply
to the extent that its application would adversely affect the validity, ranking, priority or enforceability
of, or materially adversely affect the ability to take enforcement over, the security interest(s) created
under such Security Document (other than any such security interests that, in accordance with the
Security Principles or the SFA Security Principles, would not have been required to be created), in each
case, as determined by the Company in good faith or (D) to amend, supplement or modify any one or
more Security Documents to the extent necessary or appropriate to eliminate any conflict or
inconsistency between provisions of the Security Documents and those of any other Note Document;

(x) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the holders of the Notes in any material
respect; or

(xi) effect or confirm transfers of Collateral permitted under the first paragraph of this covenant.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Security Document may be amended and no waiver of any of the

requirements of, or granting of any consent under, any Security Document may be made unless any such amendment,
waiver or consent applies equally to all holders of the Notes. In the event of any action under this covenant, the consent
of the Trustee, the Security Trustee or the holders of the Notes shall not be required.

**_Intercreditor Deed; Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Security Trustee is a party to the Intercreditor Deed and the Trustee became a party to the Intercreditor

Deed by executing an accession and/or amendment deed thereto on the Issue Date, and each holder of a Note, by
accepting such Note, will be deemed to have irrevocably (i) authorized and directed each of the Trustee and the Security
Trustee to execute and deliver the Intercreditor Deed and any other intercreditor agreement contemplated by the
Indenture, in each case on behalf of such holder and without any further consent, authorization or other action by such
holder, (ii) consented to the treatment of Liens to be provided for under the Intercreditor Deed and any other intercreditor
agreement contemplated by the Indenture, (iii) agreed that, upon the execution and delivery thereof, such holder will be
bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Deed and/or any other intercreditor agreement contemplated by the Indenture
as if it were a signatory thereto and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of the Intercreditor Deed and any other
intercreditor agreement contemplated by the Indenture, (iv) appointed each of the Trustee and the Security Trustee to act
on its behalf and to perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to them
under the Intercreditor Deed and under any other intercreditor agreement contemplated by the Indenture, (v) authorized
and directed the Trustee and the Security Trustee to carry out the provisions and intent of this section and the
Intercreditor Deed and any other intercreditor agreement contemplated by the Indenture, (vi) authorized and directed the
Trustee and the Security Trustee to take such actions as shall be required to release Liens on the Collateral in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Deed and any other intercreditor agreement contemplated by the Indenture and
(vii) agreed that no holder of the Notes shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Trustee or the Security
Trustee as a result of any action taken by the Trustee or the Security Trustee pursuant to this covenant or in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Deed and/or any other intercreditor agreement contemplated by the Indenture.

At the request of the Company, at the time of, or prior to, the incurrence or establishment of any Indebtedness or

other obligations that are permitted to be secured by Liens on the Collateral pursuant to the definition of Permitted
Collateral Liens, the Trustee and the Security Trustee shall, and by accepting a Note, each holder of the Notes shall be
deemed to have irrevocably authorized and directed the Trustee and the Security Trustee to, in each case on behalf of
such holder and without any further consent, authorization or other action by such holder, execute and deliver (i) an
additional intercreditor agreement (A) on terms that are substantially the same as those contained in the Intercreditor
Deed (or terms that are no less favorable to the holders of the Notes) and/or (B) in the case of any inventory financing or
similar arrangement, on terms that are within the range of terms and conditions customary for intercreditor agreements
that are of the type that govern intercreditor relationships between providers of inventory financings or similar
arrangements, on the one hand, and holders of Public Debt, on the other hand, and do not materially impair the rights of
the holders of the Notes in respect of payment or enforcement, in each case as determined in good faith by the Company
and consented to by the Trustee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, it being
understood that in providing such consent the Trustee may conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate of the Company


-----

setting forth its determination set forth above) or (ii) an accession and/or amendment to the Intercreditor Deed to permit
such Indebtedness or other obligations to be subject to (and benefit from) substantially the same terms with respect to the
release of the Collateral and Guarantees, enforcement of security interests, turnover, limitations on enforcement and other
rights and limitations of the creditors of Senior Secured Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness, as applicable, as
those contained in the Intercreditor Deed (or, in the case of any such terms, terms that are no less favorable to the holders
of the Notes), it being understood and agreed, in each case, that the execution and delivery by the Trustee and the
Security Trustee of any such additional intercreditor agreement or any such accession or amendment shall be conclusive
evidence of the satisfaction of the foregoing requirements as to the terms thereof.

At the request of the Company from time to time, the Trustee and Security Trustee shall, and by accepting a

Note, each holder of the Notes shall be deemed to have irrevocably authorized and directed the Trustee and the Security
Trustee to, in each case on behalf of such holder and without any further consent, authorization or other action by such
holder, execute and deliver one or more amendments, supplements or other modifications to the Intercreditor Deed
(including any other intercreditor agreement contemplated by the Indenture) to:

(i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein or reflect changes of a minor, technical or
administrative nature;

(ii) increase or decrease the amount or change the type of Indebtedness or other obligations covered
thereby that are permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be incurred by the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary and to be subject thereto;

(iii) add Restricted Subsidiaries, Guarantors or other Persons (such as representatives of new issuances or
incurrences of Indebtedness or other obligations) as parties thereto;

(iv) further secure the Notes, including to make provision for the grant of Liens on the Collateral to secure
Additional Notes;

(v) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens and provide for other Liens not prohibited by the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Liens”;

(vi) make any other change to the Intercreditor Deed (or such other intercreditor agreement) to provide for
additional Indebtedness (which may be Pari Passu Indebtedness or Subordinated Indebtedness) or other
obligations that are permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be secured by a Lien on the Collateral on
a senior, pari passu or junior basis with the Liens securing the Notes and the Guarantees;

(vii) provide for the release of the Liens on any Proceeds Loans upon the payment in full or other discharge
of such Proceeds Loans (including as a result of any merger, consolidation or amalgamation of the
payor or the payee thereunder) (and the release of the Liens on any amounts so repaid or discharged) or
the repayment, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or other discharge of the relevant SFA Loans, the
March 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured
Notes, the Notes, other Senior Secured Notes, any High Yield Notes or any other Indebtedness;

(viii) provide for (A) the cancellation and discharge of all or a portion of the principal amount of any
Proceeds Loans in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the corresponding Indebtedness giving
rise thereto then-outstanding, (B) the cancellation and discharge of a corresponding amount of the
principal amount of any Proceeds Loans upon the repayment, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or
other discharge of the corresponding Indebtedness giving rise thereto and (C) the cancellation and
discharge of any Guarantor from its obligations and liabilities in respect of any Proceeds Loans upon
the repayment, defeasance, satisfaction, cancellation or other discharge of all of the corresponding
Indebtedness giving rise thereto then-outstanding;

(xi) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Notes in

the Company;


-----

(xii) reflect appropriately therein any changes made to the definitions in any Senior Secured Term Loans
Agreement that are referred to or included in the Intercreditor Deed (or any such other intercreditor
agreement); provided that no such changes shall be permitted under this clause (xii) to the extent they
affect the ranking of any Note or Guarantee in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
holders of the Notes in any material respect except as otherwise permitted by the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Deed (or any such other intercreditor agreement); or

(xiii) permit payments to be made to the Issuer that would not otherwise have been permitted pursuant to the
terms thereof.

The Company will not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Trustee to enter into any amendment,

supplement or other modification to the Intercreditor Deed and any other intercreditor agreement contemplated by the
Indenture without the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, other than any
such amendment, supplement or other modification that, pursuant to the provisions described under “—Modifications
_and Amendments” or the Intercreditor Deed, does not require the consent of at least the holders of a majority in principal_
amount of the outstanding Notes.

If (i) (A) any payment, repayment, redemption, acquisition or defeasance in respect of any Second Secured

Liabilities, Subordinated High Yield Liabilities, Subordinated Liabilities or Hedging Liabilities (each, as defined in the
Intercreditor Deed) or (B) the taking, acceptance or receipt of the benefit of any Lien, guarantee, indemnity or assurance
against loss in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities is permitted or not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture (each a

Permitted Action may not be permitted, under clauses 4.1 (Second Secured Creditors: Rights and Obligations—
_Payment), 6.1 (High Yield Creditors: Rights and Obligations—Payment), 7.2 (Intra-Group Creditors: Rights and_
_Obligations—Security Interests), 8.1 (Subordinated Creditors: Rights and Obligations—Payment) or, as the case may be,_
9.2 (Hedge Counterparties: Rights and Obligations—Payment) of the Intercreditor Deed, each holder of the Notes shall,
by accepting a Note, be deemed to have agreed that such Permitted Action shall be deemed, for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Deed, to have been prohibited under the Indenture and each holder of the Notes shall, by accepting such
Notes, be deemed to have given its prior consent to such Permitted Action and to have authorized each of the Trustee and
the Security Trustee to execute and deliver such document as the Company may request confirming such consent;
_provided that this paragraph shall be without prejudice to and shall not affect the rights and obligations under clause 11_
(Stop Events and Payment Blockage Events) of the Intercreditor Deed. In this paragraph, capitalized words and
expressions shall have the meaning given them in the Intercreditor Deed.

**_Provision of Financial Statements_**

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Parent will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ended December 31,
2022: (i) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent as of the end of, and the audited
consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Parent for, such fiscal year, setting forth in
each case in comparative form the figures for the prior fiscal year (which may be presented on a pro
_forma combined basis), together with required footnotes to such financial statements and the report of_
the independent auditors on such financial statements (which report shall be prepared in accordance
with IFRS), (ii) pro forma consolidated income statement and balance sheet information of the Parent
(which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X), together with explanatory footnotes, for
any material (as determined by the Company in good faith) acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of such fiscal year, unless pro forma
information with respect thereto has been previously provided pursuant to this covenant, (iii) an
operating and financial review of the audited consolidated financial statements, including a discussion
of the consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the
Parent, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical accounting policies,
(iv) a description of the business, management and shareholders of the Parent, all material affiliate
transactions and all material contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments, (v) a
description of material risk factors (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be limited to risk factors
affecting the business of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) and material recent
developments, (vi) a presentation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
(vii) a presentation of capital expenditures, and (viii) a presentation of depreciation and amortization;
_provided that any disclosure with respect to any item (referred to in clauses (ii) through (viii) above)_
that (x) complies in all material respects with the requirements that would be applicable under
Form 20-F under the U.S. Exchange Act with respect to such item or (y) the Company otherwise
determines to be reasonable as to such item, consistent with the Company’s past practice, in each case,
shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements under this clause (1) with respect to such item;


-----

(2) within 60 days after the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year, beginning with the
fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023: (i) the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet of the
Parent as of the end of such fiscal quarter and the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
income and cash flows of the Parent for such fiscal quarter or the portion of the fiscal year then ended,
setting forth in each case in comparative form the figures for the comparable prior year period (which
may be presented on a pro forma combined basis), together with condensed footnotes to such financial
statements, (ii) pro forma condensed consolidated income statement and balance sheet information of
the Parent (which need not comply with Article 11 of Regulation S-X), together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material (as determined by the Company in good faith) acquisitions, dispositions or
recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of such fiscal year, unless pro forma
information with respect thereto has been previously provided pursuant to this covenant, (iii) an
operating and financial review of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, including
a discussion of the consolidated results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and capital
resources of the Parent, and a discussion of material commitments and contingencies and critical
accounting policies, and (iv) a description of material recent developments and any material changes to
the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; provided that any disclosure with respect to
any item (referred to in clauses (ii) through (iv) above) that (x) complies in all material respects with
the requirements that would be applicable under Form 10-Q under the U.S. Exchange Act with respect
to such item or (y) the Company otherwise determines to be reasonable as to such item, consistent with
the Company’s past practice, in each case, shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements under this
clause (2) with respect to such item; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any acquisition, disposition or restructuring that is material to the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior executive officer changes at
the Parent or the Issuer or change in auditors of the Parent or the Issuer or any other material event that
the Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries announces publicly, a report containing a description of
such event.

Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee shall be for informational purposes only and

the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants under
the Indenture or the Notes (as to which the Trustee shall be entitled to rely exclusively on Officer’s Certificates).

All financial statements and pro forma financial information will be prepared in accordance with IFRS on a

consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1) and (2) above may,
in the event of a change in applicable IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods, subject to the
provisions of the Indenture. Except as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for
Subsidiaries of the Parent or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this offering memorandum. For the purposes of this covenant, IFRS shall be deemed
to be IFRS as in effect from time to time, without giving effect to the proviso in the definition thereof.

Contemporaneously with the furnishing of each such report discussed above, the Company will also post such

report on the Parent’s website. In the event that the Parent becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a)
or 15(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, the Parent will, for so long as it continues to
file the reports required by Section 13(a) or 15(d) with the SEC, make available to the Trustee the annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Parent is required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a)
or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Parent will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding three paragraphs.

The Indenture will also provide that, so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the Parent will make

available to any prospective purchaser of Notes or beneficial owner of Notes in connection with any sale thereof the
information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act. The Parent and the Issuer will also make any of
the foregoing information available during normal business hours at the offices of the listing agent in Luxembourg if and
so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the
Euro MTF Market thereof and the rules of the stock exchange so require.

**_Listing_**

Each of the Company and the Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain on or prior to the first

interest payment date a listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the admission of
the Notes to trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain such listing for so long as such Notes are outstanding; provided that if at any time the Issuer
determines that it will not seek or maintain such listing, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the


-----

first interest payment date or prior to the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
for trading on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, a listing of such Notes on another “recognised
stock exchange” as defined in section 1005 of the United Kingdom Income Tax Act 2007 (the “ITA”) for the purposes of
section 987 of the ITA, or a “regulated recognised stock exchange” (within the meaning of section 987 of the ITA).

**_Limitation on Parent and Parent Intermediate Holdcos Activities_**

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indenture:

(1) neither the Parent nor any Parent Intermediate Holdco will engage in any business activity, except any
such activity (i) reasonably relating to the offering, sale, issuance, incurrence and servicing, purchase,
redemption, amendment, exchange, refinancing or retirement of the Notes or any other Indebtedness
not prohibited by the Indenture or of any Capital Stock; (ii) undertaken with the purpose of fulfilling
any other obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans Agreement, the March 2026 Senior
Secured Notes, the May 2026 Senior Secured Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the Notes or other
Senior Secured Notes, any High Yield Notes, the Proceeds Loans, any Hedging Obligations or any
agreements or instruments relating to any other Indebtedness or other obligations not prohibited by the
Indenture, including any Proceeds Loan or any guarantees or Liens relating to any of the foregoing;
(iii) involving the provision of administrative services (including treasury services), human resources
functions and other corporate and overhead services to its Subsidiaries of a type customarily provided
by a holding company to its Subsidiaries and the receipt of any amounts related thereto; (iv) related to
the establishment and/or maintenance of such Person’s corporate existence or corporate activities, the
acquisition, holding or disposition of assets not prohibited to be held by it under the Indenture or
reasonably related to its function as a holding company, including, for the avoidance of doubt, (1) the
participation in tax and accounting matters as a member of the consolidated group with the Company
and its Subsidiaries, (2) the entry into, and performance of its obligations with respect to, contracts and
other arrangements with officers, directors, employees and consultants, (3) the obtainment of, and the
payment of any fees and expenses for, management, consulting, monitoring, investment banking,
advisory and other services, (4) the payment of dividends and distributions and the purchase of Capital
Stock of, and the making of capital contributions to, its Subsidiaries and (5) preparing reports to
Governmental Authorities and complying with applicable law; (v) undertaken in connection with any
Permitted Investment, any Restricted Payment, any Permitted Payment, any Permitted Reorganization
or the Financing Transactions; or (vi) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are
immaterial in nature; and

(2) neither the Parent nor any Parent Intermediate Holdco will own any assets or property other than
(i) Capital Stock of another Parent Intermediate Holdco, any Financing Subsidiary or the Company,
(ii) intercompany Indebtedness, (iii) any rights under any contract or agreement, provided that the
Parent or such Parent Intermediate Holdco shall remain in compliance with the preceding clause (1),
(iv) any cash, cash equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments, (v) any assets and properties arising
from activities of the Parent or any Parent Intermediate Holdco undertaken in compliance with the
preceding clause (1) and (vi) other assets and properties that are immaterial in nature; provided that
each of the Parent and any Parent Intermediate Holdco may from time to time receive in a transaction
otherwise permitted under the Indenture and the Security Documents properties and assets (including
cash, cash equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments, shares of Capital Stock of another Person and/or
Indebtedness and other obligations) for the purpose of transferring such properties and assets to any
Parent Holdco, any Subsidiary or any other Person, so long as in any case such further transfer is made
promptly by the Parent or such Parent Intermediate Holdco, as applicable, and, after giving effect
thereto, the Parent or such Parent Intermediate Holdco, as applicable, is in compliance with this
clause (2).

**_Limitations on Use of Proceeds_**

The net proceeds from each issue of Notes will be applied by the Issuer outside Switzerland unless (i) use in

Switzerland is permitted under the Swiss taxation laws in force from time to time or (ii) it is confirmed in a tax ruling by
the Swiss Federal Tax Administration that such use of proceeds is permitted, in each case without payments in respect of
the Notes becoming subject to withholding or deduction for Swiss withholding tax as a consequence of such use of
proceeds in Switzerland.


-----

**_Suspension of Covenants and Release of Guarantees on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Investment Grade Requirement shall have been satisfied and no

Default or Event of Default has then occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on such date
and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Investment Grade Requirement ceases to be satisfied,

(a) the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:
“—Limitation on Indebtedness”, “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”, “—Limitation on Transactions
_with Affiliates”, “—Limitation on Sale of Assets”, “—Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment_
_Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”, the first paragraph of “—Impairment of Security_
_Interest”, “—Limitation on Layered Debt”, “—Limitation on Unrestricted Subsidiaries” and clause (c)_
of the covenant described under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets—The Parent, the Parent
_Intermediate Holdcos and the Company” and any related Default or Event of Default provisions of the_
Indenture will cease to have any force and effect (and the Parent, the Parent Intermediate Holdcos, the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not be required to comply therewith); and

(b) the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the Trustee and the
Security Trustee, to request the release and discharge of all Guarantees by any Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company (other than the Guarantee of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a parent entity of the
Issuer) created under the Indenture or any supplemental indenture to the Indenture, whereupon the
Trustee and the Security Trustee shall execute and deliver any document requested by the Company to
effect and evidence the release and discharge of such Guarantees and any related release of Liens
pursuant to “—Brief Description of the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security—Security—Release of
_Security”; provided that such Guarantee shall not be released and discharged unless, substantially_
concurrently with such release and discharge, any guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary in respect of
the SFA Term Loans shall be released and discharged and no other Indebtedness is at that time
guaranteed by the relevant Restricted Subsidiary that would have otherwise given rise to an obligation
to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Issuance of Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries” had the relevant Restricted_
Subsidiary not already been a Guarantor;

_provided further that if the Investment Grade Requirement ceases to be satisfied, then such provisions of the Indenture,_
and any related Defaults or Events of Default, will again apply in accordance with their terms from and after the first day
on which the Investment Grade Requirement ceases to be satisfied (it being understood and agreed, however, that such
provisions of the Indenture, and any related Defaults and Events of Default, will not be of any effect with regard to
actions of the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary properly taken prior
thereto, and the “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it had been in effect since the
Issue Date except that no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted
Payment made while such covenant was suspended).

The Company shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth above in this covenant have been satisfied,

_provided that such notification shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective,_
nor shall failure to notify the Trustee thereof constitute a breach of this covenant or default under the Indenture. The
Trustee shall be under no obligation to notify the holders of the Notes that the conditions set forth in this covenant have
been satisfied.

**_Additional Provisions_**

The Indenture will also contain provisions with respect to the following matters: (a) payment of principal,

premium, any Additional Amounts and interest; (b) maintenance of certain offices or agencies; and (c) arrangements
regarding the handling of money held in trust.

**Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets**

**_The Parent, the Parent Intermediate Holdcos and the Company_**

Subject to the provisions described under “—General” below, none of the Parent, any Parent Intermediate

Holdco or the Company will, in a single transaction or through a series of related transactions, consolidate with,
amalgamate with or merge with or into any other Person (whether or not the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco or
the Company, as applicable, is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its
properties and assets (or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter into any such transaction or series of
transactions) if such transaction or series of transactions, in the aggregate, would result in a sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition to any other Person or group of Persons of all or substantially all of the


-----

properties and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, such Parent Intermediate Holdco and its Restricted
Subsidiaries or the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, on a Consolidated basis, unless at the
time of the transaction and after giving effect thereto:

(a) either:

(1) the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company, as the case may be, will be the
continuing Person; or

(2) the Person (if other than the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company, as the
case may be) formed by such consolidation or amalgamation or into which the Parent, such
Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, such Parent Intermediate
Holdco and its Restricted Subsidiaries or the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, on a Consolidated basis (for the purposes of this subsection of the covenant
described under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, the “Surviving Entity”) will
be a Person duly organized and validly existing under the laws of any EU state which is a
member of the EU on the Issue Date, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, the United
States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia or the Island of Jersey or a
Permitted Jurisdiction and such Person expressly assumes all the obligations of the Parent,
such Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company, as the case may be, under the Notes, the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Deed and the Security Documents to which it is a party pursuant to
agreements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee (and the Guarantees will be confirmed as
applying to such Surviving Entity’s obligations);

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness
not previously an obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries which becomes the
obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having
been incurred at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be
continuing;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (on the assumption that such
transaction occurred on the first day of the most recent four-quarter period for which financial
statements are available ending immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction, with the
appropriate adjustments with respect to such transaction, including treating any obligation incurred by
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with or as a result of such transaction as
having been incurred by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction,
being included in such pro forma calculation), (i) the Company (or the Surviving Entity if the
Company is not the continuing obligor under the Indenture) could incur €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) under the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the Parent’s Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage_
Ratio for such period would not be less than it would be for such period prior to giving pro forma
effect to such transaction; and

(d) at the time of such transaction, the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, will have delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Trustee, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate or an opinion of legal
counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger, transfer, sale, assignment, conveyance, lease
or other transaction and the supplemental indenture in respect thereof comply with the Indenture and
that all conditions precedent therein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with;
_provided that in giving an opinion of counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any_
matters of fact. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate or
opinion of counsel without independent verification.

In the event of any transaction (other than a lease) described in and complying with the conditions set forth in

the immediately preceding paragraph in which the Parent, the applicable Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company, as

exercise every right and power of the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company, as the case may be, and
the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company, as applicable, will, subject to the second paragraph of the
provisions described under “—General”, be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all
obligations and covenants under the Indenture (including its Guarantee and, if the Company shall have been the Issuer,


-----

the Notes) and each of the other Notes Documents to which the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco or the Company,
as applicable, is a party.

**_Issuer_**

Subject to the provisions described under “—General” below, the Issuer (other than, if it shall be the Issuer, the

Company) will not, in a single transaction or through a series of related transactions, consolidate with, amalgamate with
or merge with or into any other Person (whether or not the Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of its properties and assets (or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter into
any such transaction or series of transactions) if such transaction or series of transactions, in the aggregate, would result
in a sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition to any other Person or group of Persons of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis, unless at
the time of the transaction and after giving effect thereto:

(a) either:

(1) the Issuer will be the continuing Person; or

(2) the Person (if other than the Issuer) formed by such consolidation or amalgamation or into
which the Issuer is merged or the Person which acquires by sale, assignment, conveyance,

subsection of the covenant described under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, the
“Surviving Entity”) will be a Person duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
any EU state which is a member of the EU on the Issue Date, the United Kingdom, Norway,
Switzerland, the United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia or the
Island of Jersey or a Permitted Jurisdiction and such Person expressly assumes all the
obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Deed and the
Security Documents to which the Issuer is a party pursuant to agreements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee (and the Guarantees will be confirmed as applying to such
Surviving Entity’s obligations);

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness
not previously an obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries which becomes the
obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having
been incurred at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be
continuing; and

(c) at the time of such transaction, the Issuer or the Surviving Entity will have delivered, or caused to be
delivered, to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s
Certificate or an opinion of legal counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger, transfer,
sale, assignment, conveyance, lease or other transaction and the supplemental indenture in respect
thereof comply with the Indenture and that all conditions precedent therein provided for relating to
such transaction have been complied with; provided that in giving an opinion of counsel, counsel may
rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel without independent verification.

In the event of any transaction (other than a lease) described in and complying with the conditions set forth in

the immediately preceding paragraph in which the Issuer is not the Surviving Entity, the Surviving Entity will succeed to,
and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of the Issuer, and the Issuer will, subject to the second
paragraph of the provisions described under “—General”, be automatically and unconditionally be released and
discharged from all obligations and covenants under the Indenture, the Notes and each of the other Notes Documents to
which the Issuer is a party.

**_Subsidiary Guarantors_**

Subject to the provisions described under “—General”, a Subsidiary Guarantor (other than a Subsidiary

Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Guarantee and the Indenture) will not, in
a single transaction or through a series of related transactions, consolidate with, amalgamate with or merge with or into
any other Person (whether or not such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of its properties and assets (or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter into any such
transaction or series of transactions) if such transaction or series of transactions, in the aggregate, would result in a sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition to any other Person or group of Persons of all or substantially all of


-----

the properties and assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis, unless at

described under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”, the “Surviving Entity”) will
be a Person duly organized and validly existing under the laws of any state that was a member
of the European Union on the Issue Date, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, the
United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, the Island of Jersey or

Person expressly assumes all the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Indenture
(including its Guarantee), the Intercreditor Deed and the other Notes Documents to which
such Subsidiary Guarantor is a party pursuant to agreements reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee (it being agreed that the Guarantee of such Surviving Entity may contain limitations
set forth in or contemplated by “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the Security Interests” and as contemplated by the Security Principles);_

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (and treating any Indebtedness
not previously an obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries which becomes the
obligation of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having
been incurred at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be
continuing; and

(c) at the time of such transaction, such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Company or the Surviving Entity will
have delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Trustee, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate or an opinion of legal counsel, each to the effect that such
consolidation, merger, transfer, sale, assignment, conveyance, lease or other transaction and the

therein provided for relating to such transaction have been complied with; provided that in giving an
opinion of counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact. The Trustee
shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel without
independent verification.

In the event of any transaction (other than a lease) described in and complying with the conditions set forth in

the immediately preceding paragraph in which the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor is not the Surviving Entity, the
Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of such Subsidiary
Guarantor and such Subsidiary Guarantor will, subject to the second paragraph under “—General” below, be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged from all obligations and covenants under the Indenture
(including its Guarantees), the Proceeds Loans Documents and each of the other Notes Documents to which such
Guarantor is a party.

**_General_**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the subsection “—The Parent, the Parent

_Intermediate Holdcos and the Company”, paragraph (b) of the subsection “—Issuer” and paragraph (b) of the subsection_
“—Subsidiary Guarantors” (which shall not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence), (i) any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company may consolidate or otherwise combine with, amalgamate with, merge with or into or sell,
assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of its properties and assets to the Issuer, the
Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary and (ii) the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the
Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, amalgamate with or merge with or into an Affiliate incorporated or
organized for the primary purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco, the
Company or the Issuer in another jurisdiction, reincorporating the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company
or the Issuer in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Parent, such Parent Intermediate Holdco, the
Company or the Issuer (in each case, in a jurisdiction that would be permitted under paragraph (a)(2) under the caption
“—The Parent, the Parent Intermediate Holdcos and the Company” or paragraph (a)(2) under the caption “—Issuer”, as
applicable).


-----

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this covenant, upon the succession and substitution of any

Guarantor by any Surviving Entity in a sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of properties and
assets subject to this covenant, upon the written request of the Company to the Trustee, such Guarantor shall not be
released and discharged from its Guarantee and shall continue to be bound by its obligations and covenants under the
Indenture and the other Notes Documents to which it is a party as a Guarantor; provided that, in the event such Guarantor
is the Parent, any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the Issuer and to the extent provided in such request, such
Guarantor shall continue to be bound by its obligations and covenants under the Indenture and the other Notes
Documents solely in its capacity as a Guarantor and shall not be subject to or bound by any of the obligations and
covenants applicable to the Parent, a Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company or the Issuer, as applicable, and only the
applicable Surviving Entity shall be subject to and bound by such obligations and covenants.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise

established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of
uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Indenture and in any other Notes Document, the Parent,

any Parent Intermediate Holdco, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may implement a Permitted
Reorganization.

**Events of Default**

An Event of Default will occur under the Indenture if:

(a) there shall be a default in the payment of any interest or Additional Amounts on any Note when it
becomes due and payable, and such default shall continue for a period of 30 days;

(b) there shall be a default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise) of the
principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Note;

(c)

(1) there shall be a default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or agreement of the
Issuer or any Guarantor under the Indenture or any Guarantee (other than a default in the
performance, or breach, of a covenant or agreement which is specifically dealt with in
clause (a), (b) or in clause (2), (3) or (4) of this clause (c)) and such default or breach shall
continue for a period of 60 days after written notice has been given, by certified mail, (x) to
the Issuer by the Trustee or (y) to the Issuer and the Trustee by the holders of at least 30% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes voting as a single class,

(2) there shall be a default in the performance or breach of the provisions described in “—
_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”,_

(3) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary shall have failed to make or consummate an Asset
Sale Offer in accordance with the provisions of “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of
_Assets”, or_

(4) the Issuer or the Company shall have failed to make or consummate a Change of Control
Offer in accordance with the provisions of “—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of Control”;

(d) any default in the payment of the principal or premium, if any, on any Indebtedness shall have occurred
under any of the agreements, indentures or instruments under which the Issuer, any Guarantor or any
Significant Restricted Subsidiary then has outstanding Indebtedness in excess of €50.0 million when
the same shall become due and payable in full and such default shall have continued after any
applicable grace period and shall not have been cured or waived and, if not already matured at its final
maturity in accordance with its terms, the holder of such Indebtedness shall have accelerated such
Indebtedness;

(e) any Guarantee by the Parent, the Company or a Significant Restricted Subsidiary is held in any judicial
proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to be, or shall for any reason be
asserted in writing by any Guarantor or the Issuer not to be, in full force and effect and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent contemplated by the Indenture and any such Guarantee;


-----

(f) (i) one or more of the Security Documents that, taken as a whole, create Liens on a material portion of
the Collateral shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect, or shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, other than, in each case, pursuant to limitations on
enforceability, validity or effectiveness imposed by applicable law or the terms of such Security
Document or except in accordance with the terms of such Security Document, the Intercreditor Deed or
the Indenture, including the release provisions thereof, and such failure to be in full force and effect
shall have continued uncured for a period of 15 days after the Company becomes aware of such failure
or (ii) repudiation or disaffirmation by the Issuer or any Guarantor of any of their respective obligations
under the Security Documents that, taken as a whole, create Liens on a material portion of the
Collateral;

(g) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees of any court or regulatory or administrative agency for
the payment of money in excess of €50.0 million, either individually or in the aggregate (to the extent
not covered by independent third-party insurance), shall be rendered against the Issuer, the Company or
any Significant Restricted Subsidiary or any of their respective properties and shall not be discharged
and there shall have been a period of 60 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such
judgment or order, by reason of an appeal or otherwise, shall not be in effect;

(h) [Reserved]; or

(i) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Parent, the
Company, the Issuer or any Significant Restricted Subsidiary shall have occurred.

If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (i) of the prior paragraph) shall occur and be continuing

with respect to the Indenture, the Trustee or the holders of not less than 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding may, and the Trustee, at the request of such holders, shall declare all unpaid principal of, premium, if
any, any Additional Amounts and accrued interest on all Notes to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing
to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the holders of the Notes) and upon any such declaration, such principal,
premium, if any, any Additional Amounts and interest shall become due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default
specified in clause (i) of the prior paragraph occurs and is continuing, then all the Notes shall ipso facto (to the fullest
extent permitted by law) become and be due and payable immediately in an amount equal to the principal amount of the
Notes, together with any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date the Notes become due
and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder. Thereupon, the Trustee may, at
its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the rights of the holders of the Notes by appropriate judicial proceedings. In
the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (d) of the prior
paragraph has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if
the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (d) shall be remedied or cured,
or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default, or such Indebtedness shall be
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the
acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all
existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely
because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

After a declaration of acceleration, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been

obtained by the Trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding by written notice to
the Issuer and the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and annul such declaration and its consequences under the
Indenture if:

(a) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

(1) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee under the Indenture and the properly incurred
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel,

(2) all overdue interest and Additional Amounts on all Notes then outstanding,

(3) the principal of and premium, if any, on any Notes then-outstanding which have become due
otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and interest thereon at the rate borne by the
Notes, and

(4) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate
borne by the Notes;

(b) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; and


-----

(c) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of principal of, premium, if any, and any Additional
Amounts and interest on the Notes, which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration,
have been cured or waived as provided in the Indenture. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent
default or impair any right consequent thereon.

The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes may, by written

notice to the Trustee, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Notes, waive any past default under the Indenture and its
consequences, except a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under the Indenture cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of the holders of not less than 90% of the then-outstanding amount of one or more series
of Notes, in which case the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the then-outstanding Notes or relevant series of
Notes, as applicable, shall be required.

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes

may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust of power. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of
any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or
Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

No holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any

remedy thereunder, unless the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have made
written request, and offered satisfactory indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding), to the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as the Trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such
proceeding within 60 days after receipt of such notice and offer of satisfactory indemnity and/or security (including by
way of pre-funding) and the Trustee, during such 60-day period, has not received directions inconsistent with such
written request from the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. Such limitations
do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a holder of a Note for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in
such Note.

The Company will promptly, and in any event within 15 Business Days of becoming aware of such Default or

Event of Default, notify the Trustee of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default that is continuing. Except in the
case of a Default or an Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on
any Notes, the Trustee may withhold the notice to the holders of such Notes if a committee of its trust officers in good
faith determines that withholding the notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes. If a Default or an Event of
Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing, the Trustee will mail to each holder of the Notes
notice of the Default or Event of Default within five Business Days after being notified of its occurrence. The Company
will deliver to the Trustee, on or before a date not more than 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a written
statement as to compliance with the Indenture, including whether or not any Default has occurred. The Trustee is under
no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the
holders of the Notes unless such holders offer to the Trustee indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding)
satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred thereby.

**Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance of Indenture**

The Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations terminated with respect to the

outstanding Notes of a series and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to the Guarantees of such
series of Notes (“Legal Defeasance”) and cure all then-existing Events of Default with respect to such series of Notes,
except for, among other things, certain obligations, including those relating to the defeasance trust, obligations to transfer
or exchange Notes of such series, to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such series of Notes, to replace mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Notes of such series and to maintain a paying agent for such series of Notes, and obligations with
respect to the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have its obligations and the obligations of the

Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture and the Guarantees (“Covenant
**Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or Event of**
Default with respect to the Notes of a series. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (not including
non-payment, and, solely with respect to the Issuer, bankruptcy and insolvency events) described under “—Events of
_Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes of such series._

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust with the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes
of the applicable series, cash in Euro, European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof (in
the case of the Euro Notes) or Dollars or U.S. Government Obligations, or a combination thereof (in


-----

the case of the Dollar Notes), in such aggregate amounts as will be sufficient to pay the principal of,
interest and premium, if any, on the Notes of such series to maturity;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee:

(1) an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that
(A) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service a ruling or (B) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S.
federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of
counsel will confirm that, the holders of the outstanding Notes of the applicable series will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred; and

(2) an opinion of counsel in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the holders of the Notes of the applicable series will
not recognize income, gain or loss for tax purposes of such jurisdiction as a result of such
Legal Defeasance and will be subject to tax in such jurisdiction on the same amounts and in
the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance
had not occurred; and

(c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee:

(1) an opinion of United States counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the
holders of the outstanding Notes of the applicable series will not recognize income, gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be
subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred; and

(2) an opinion of counsel in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Issuer and reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the holders of the Notes of the applicable series will
not recognize income, gain or loss for tax purposes of such jurisdiction as a result of such
Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to tax in such jurisdiction on the same amounts and
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to transfer or exchange of the

Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all the outstanding Notes of a series issued under the Indenture
when:

(a) either:

(1) all such Notes of the applicable series theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost,
stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid or Notes whose payment has been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the
Issuer or discharged from such trust as provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered to
the Trustee for cancellation, or

(2) all Notes of the applicable series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
(A) have become due and payable, (B) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year, or (C) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name,
and at the expense, of the Issuer; and the Issuer or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust an amount in Euro, European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes or any other
Euro-denominated series) or Dollars, U.S. Government Obligations or a combination thereof
(in the case of the Dollar Notes or any other Dollar-denominated series) sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes of the applicable series not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including the principal of, premium, if any, any


-----

Additional Amounts and accrued interest on, such Notes at such Maturity, Stated Maturity or
redemption date;

(b) the Issuer or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture
with respect to the Notes of the applicable series by the Issuer and any Guarantor; and

(c) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of independent counsel,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, each stating that:

(1) all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture with respect to the Notes of the applicable series have been complied with; and

(2) such satisfaction and discharge will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, the Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Issuer,
any Guarantor or any Subsidiary is a party or by which the Issuer, any Guarantor or any
Subsidiary is bound;

_provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as_
to compliance with this clause (c) and the foregoing clauses (a) and (b)). The Trustee will be entitled to
rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel without independent verification.

If requested by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the holders prior to

maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. In such case, the payment to each holder will equal the amount such
holder would have been entitled to receive at the stated maturity or on the relevant redemption date, as the case may be.
For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth
above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost or any other premium on such amounts.

**Modifications and Amendments**

Without limiting the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ ability to effect modifications or amendments that are

expressly permitted under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” or “—Certain Covenants—
_Intercreditor Deed; Additional Intercreditor Agreements” or are otherwise permitted under this caption “—Modifications_
_and Amendments”, modifications and amendments of the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Deed,_
any additional intercreditor agreement and/or the Security Documents may be made by the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Trustee and the Security Trustee, in each case, to the extent a party thereto, with the consent of the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (unless a modification or amendment will only
affect one series of the Notes, in which case only the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding of such series shall be required); provided, however, that no such modification or
amendment may, without the consent of the holders of at least 90% of the then-outstanding aggregate principal amount of
the Notes (or, if a modification or amendment will only affect one series of the Notes, the consent of the holders of at
least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding of such series):

(a) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of any Additional Amounts or interest
on any Note, or change to an earlier date the time at which any Note may be redeemed, or waive a
default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on, any
such Note or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable
upon the redemption thereof, or change the coin or currency in which the principal of any such Note or
any premium or any Additional Amounts or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case
of redemption, on or after the redemption date);

(b) reduce the percentage in principal amount of such outstanding Notes, the consent of whose holders is
required for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose holders is required for any
amendment, waiver of or compliance with provisions of the Indenture;

(c) modify any of the provisions relating to any supplemental indentures requiring the consent of holders
or relating to the waiver of past defaults or relating to the waiver of certain covenants, except to
increase the percentage of such outstanding Notes required for such actions or to provide that certain
other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of
each such Note affected thereby;

(d) except as otherwise permitted under “—Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets” or the definition of
the term “Parent”, “Parent Intermediate Holdco” or “Company” or as part of a Permitted


-----

Reorganization, assign or transfer any of the rights and obligations under the Indenture of the Issuer or
any Guarantor;

(e) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens created in favor of the Trustee or the
Security Trustee pursuant to the Security Documents or all or substantially all of the Guarantors from
the Guarantees created pursuant to the Indenture or any supplemental indenture thereto, except as
otherwise permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Deed or
any additional intercreditor agreement;

(f) except as permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Deed (or any additional intercreditor
agreement), make any change to any provision of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Deed affecting the
ranking or priority of any Note or Guarantee that would adversely affect the rights of the holders of the
Notes in any material respect;

(g) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture described under “—Payment of Additional
_Amounts” that adversely affects the holder’s or beneficial owner’s entitlement to (x) any exemption, in_
whole or in part, from withholding Taxes or (y) Additional Amounts, in each case as described
thereunder, unless the Issuer agrees to pay Additional Amounts (if any) in respect thereof; or

(h) except as permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Deed (or any additional intercreditor
agreement), release the Guarantee of the Parent or the Company.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, the Indenture will provide that certain Guarantees or Liens on the

Collateral may be released in connection with sales or other dispositions of property or assets (including Capital Stock)
that do not violate the requirements of the covenants described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sale of Assets”, as each such covenant may be amended_
from time to time.

For the avoidance of doubt, it shall not be necessary for the consent of the holders of the Notes to approve the

particular form of any proposed amendment, waiver or other modification but it shall be sufficient if such consent
approves the substance thereof.

For the purposes of determining whether holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of any series of

Notes not denominated in Euro have taken any action under the Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of such series
of Notes will be deemed to be the Euro Equivalent as of the date such series of Notes is first issued of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes.

In addition to any modifications and amendments that are permitted under, or governed by, the covenants set

forth under the captions “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”, “—Certain Covenants—Intercreditor
_Deed; Additional Intercreditor Agreements”, or the other provisions of this caption “—Modifications and Amendments”_
and not in limitation thereof, without the consent of any holders of the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Security
Trustee, in each case to the extent a party thereto (without the need for any consent of or authorization or execution by
any other party to the Indenture) may modify or amend the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Deed,
any additional intercreditor agreement or any Security Document:

(a) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or any Guarantor or any other obligor under
the Notes and the assumption by any such successor of the covenants of the Issuer or such Guarantor in

any additional intercreditor agreement or any Security Document, as applicable, in accordance with “—
_Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets”;_

(b) to add to the covenants of the Issuer, any Guarantor or any other obligor upon the Notes for the benefit
of the holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any

agreement or any Security Document;

(c) to cure any ambiguity, or to correct or supplement any provision in the Indenture (including any

Notes, any Guarantee, the Intercreditor Deed, any additional intercreditor agreement or any Security
Document or any disclosure in the Offering Memorandum or to make any other provisions with respect


-----

to matters or questions arising under the Indenture (including any supplemental indenture), the Notes,

Document that shall not adversely affect the legal rights of the holders of the Notes in any material
respect or that shall improve or increase the rights of the holders of the Notes;

(d) to add a Guarantor under the Indenture and to provide for or confirm the existence of any limitations in
any Guarantee authorized under the Indenture;

(e) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture;

(f) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the Security Trustee for the
benefit of the holders of the Notes as additional security for the payment and performance of the
Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations under the Indenture, in any property, or assets, including any of
which are required to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required
to be granted to the Security Trustee pursuant to the Indenture or otherwise (any such additional
security shall be deemed to be Collateral for all purposes under the Indenture);

(g) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture;

(h) to conform the text of the Indenture or the Notes to any passage in this “Description of the Notes” to
the extent that such passage was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture or
the Notes;

(i) to make, complete or confirm any grant of Collateral permitted or required by the Indenture;

(j) to evidence or provide for the release of any Guarantee or any Lien on any Collateral that is otherwise
permitted by the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Deed or any
additional intercreditor agreement; or

uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code).

In connection with its execution of any amendment pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Trustee shall be

entitled to request and rely on such evidence as to whether such amendment is authorized by such paragraph as the
Trustee may request, which may include an Officer’s Certificate and/or an opinion of counsel.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by

clause (d) above to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture
providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such
additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any amendments permitted by the
Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and the Trustee.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding may waive compliance with

the restrictive covenants and provisions of the Indenture.

For the avoidance of doubt, no modification or amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance

with, any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants”, shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of the
holders of the Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of

the State of New York. The Intercreditor Deed will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, English law. The
Security Documents will be governed by applicable local law of the jurisdiction under which Liens are granted.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint INEOS USA LLC, with its registered

office at Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, United States as its agent for service of
process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees and for actions
brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York and will
submit to such jurisdiction.


-----

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since many of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are outside the United States, any judgment obtained

in the United States against the Issuer or any Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts, redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be
collectable within the United States.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member or shareholder of the Issuer, any Guarantor, any of their

respective parent companies or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates as such, shall have any liability for any
obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture (including the Guarantees), the Notes or the Security Documents or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a Note waives
and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a
waiver is against public policy.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be

prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the
payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the

time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to
certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default occurs (which has not been cured), the
Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own
affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under
the Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes unless such holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and
indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense.

trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the Trustee, on behalf of the
holders of the Notes;

_provided that any event or circumstance that results in such Subordinated Indebtedness ceasing to qualify as_
Subordinated Shareholder Funding shall (A) constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company and

**DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLATERAL AND THE GUARANTEES**

The Notes and the guarantees will be secured by security interests in the assets described below (the

“Collateral”). The security interests in the Collateral will (subject to Permitted Collateral Liens) be first-ranking security
interests, except for certain security interests granted to secure the Notes which, as a matter of local law, will be granted
as junior-ranking security interests in relation to the security granted in respect of the Senior Secured Term Loans and the
Existing Senior Secured Notes. The Intercreditor Deed provides that as a contractual matter among Senior Secured
Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed), the Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Existing Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations
and will be treated as such for purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement of such Collateral. The
existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes that were
created under Luxembourg, New York and Norwegian law will remain in place and will extend to secure the Notes. In
some jurisdictions, the security documents creating the existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term
Loans and the Existing Senior Secured Notes will be amended to extend such liens (or, with respect to Belgian security,
to confirm that these liens extend) to the Notes (or, with respect to French and certain of the German security interests,
junior ranking security interests will be granted). The existing first-ranking liens securing the Senior Secured Term Loans
and the Existing Senior Secured Notes that were created under English law, Scottish law, Jersey law and Singapore law
will remain in place, and new liens over the same Collateral will be created in these jurisdictions to secure the Notes. In
these jurisdictions where new liens are created, the ranking of these new liens relative to the existing liens will, as a
matter of general law, depend on a number of factors, such as the nature of the liens, the order of creation of the liens,
compliance with the jurisdiction’s perfection requirements with respect to the liens and the order of giving notices with
respect to the liens, and accordingly without the Intercreditor Deed, the new liens would be likely to rank after the
existing liens. However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that, as a contractual matter, the liens securing the Notes, the
Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Term Loans will rank pari passu and will be treated as having
equal priority with respect to the application of proceeds from the enforcement of any Collateral. See the specific local
law security interests described below under “—Summary of the Guarantees and Collateral for the Notes” and “Risk
Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Prior ranking security interests—Any other creditors
with prior ranking liens will have prior access to proceeds of certain Collateral and your rights to enforce your security
over the Collateral are limited,” “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and the Security Interests”
and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Deed.” Upon the completion of the implementation of the security
interests in the Collateral, the Notes and the guarantees will, subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture and to
the extent possible, be secured by security interests in all of the assets and property that secure the obligations under the
Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management
liabilities. As of the date of completion of the granting of the guarantees, the Notes will be guaranteed by all of those
entities that guarantee the obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Term Loans.

The following is a country-by-country summary of the guarantees and the Collateral in respect of the Notes that

will be in place following the completion of the grants of the guarantees and the Collateral. This summary is not
complete and does not describe any of the limitations of, existing encumbrances on, and defects in respect of the
guarantees and Collateral, or any of the specific assets, properties and rights that will be excluded from the guarantees
and the Collateral. The granting of the guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral is subject to compliance with
the agreed security principles (the “Security Principles”) to be set forth in an exhibit to the Indenture, which embody the
recognition that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining guarantees and security interests in every
jurisdiction in which the Guarantors are incorporated and hold assets.

In addition, prior to the execution by the parties thereto of the security documents in respect of the Notes, the

composition of the Collateral may change (including due to the application of the Security Principles), and any such
change or changes could be material.

As described herein, the security in respect of the Notes will be implemented in two or more stages. Not all the

Collateral that will secure the Notes will be implemented as of the Issue Date. In addition, there may be delays in the
implementation of the guarantees and the Collateral.

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE**

**SECURITY INTERESTS**

Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the guarantees and the security

interests in each of the jurisdictions in which guarantees or Collateral are being provided.

It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated in any of

these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor of the Notes. The application of these
various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, and could
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes, the guarantees and the
security interests on the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of

the guarantees and security interests for the Notes and certain aspects of insolvency law in Belgium, Canada, England
and Wales, Germany, Jersey, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, which are the
jurisdictions in which the Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security to the Notes are organized or incorporated.
In the event that any one or more of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other of IGH or IHL’s subsidiaries experienced
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**European Union**

Several of the Guarantors or providers of security for the Notes are organized or incorporated under the laws of

Member States of the European Union.

Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency

proceedings (the “Recast EU Insolvency Regulation”) entered into force on June 26, 2017 and is applicable to
insolvency proceedings opened on or after that date, replacing Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on insolvency
proceedings (which continues to apply to insolvency proceedings opened prior to June 26, 2017). Pursuant to the Recast
EU Insolvency Regulation, which applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), the court which shall have
jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State where the
company has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) (which, according to Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation, is “the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is
ascertainable by third parties”). The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on
which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although there is

a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its COMI in the
Member State in which it has its registered office, this presumption only applies if the registered office has not been
moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency
proceedings.

Further, Preamble 30 of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut this

presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered
office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by
third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is
located in that other Member State.” In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where the
company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are
established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. The point at which a
company’s COMI is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has

its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation may only be commenced in such jurisdiction, and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to
commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation. Main
insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in
the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member
State. If the COMI of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the Recast EU
Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “territorial
proceedings” only in the event that such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State.
“Establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation to mean any place of operations
where the company carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those territorial proceedings


-----

are restricted to the assets of the company situated in the territory of such other Member State where proceedings were
opened. If a company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has
jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation.

Where main insolvency proceedings in the Member State in which a company has its COMI have not yet been

opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another Member State where the company has an
establishment, provided either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which that
company’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at
the request of either (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment
situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public
authority which, under the law of the Member State within whose territory the establishment is situated, has the right to
request the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such

proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the
court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of
the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State of the European Union within the territory of
which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action
that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The courts of all Member States of the European Union (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of

the court opening the main proceedings and give the same effect to the judgment so long as no secondary proceedings
have been opened there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State (other than Denmark) which
has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on
him by the law of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark), such as to remove assets of the
company from that other Member State, subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been
opened in that other Member State nor any preservation measure has been taken to the contrary further to a request to
open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the company has assets.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency_**

A number of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Belgium and have their statutory seat (statutaire

_zetel/siège social) in Belgium (the “Belgian Guarantors”). Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any of the_
Belgian Guarantors, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium, to the extent the Belgian Guarantors are viewed
to have their COMI in Belgium. Proceedings opened in Belgium will be governed by Belgian insolvency law, whereby
for secondary proceedings, the effects of Belgian insolvency law will be limited to assets located in Belgium.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for two primary insolvency procedures: a judicial restructuring procedure

(gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and a bankruptcy procedure (faillissement/ faillite). Both types of
insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX (“Insolvency of enterprises”) of the Belgian Code of Economic Law.
Note that, in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/ liquidation déficitaire). The
latter proceeding will not be further discussed.

**_Judicial Restructuring_**

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor) may file a

petition for judicial restructuring if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether immediately or in the future. The
interpretation of this principle is broad and defined by the courts. The fact that the conditions for bankruptcy are met
(entailing that the debtor has the obligation to file for bankruptcy pursuant to Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic
Law) does not preclude the debtor from applying for a judicial reorganization. If the net assets of the debtor have fallen
below 50% of the debtor’s issued capital, the continuity of the enterprise is always presumed to be at risk. A state of
bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition with the relevant court overseeing the judicial reorganization and for as long as

such court has not issued a judgment on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case
the debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order, subject to certain exceptions, none of the
debtor’s assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests that such
creditors may hold with respect to such assets. If the debtor requested the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings


-----

less than six months ago and such request was accommodated, the filing of the petition does not have a suspensory effect,
except if the court decides otherwise.

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of

the petition, the court will hear the debtor and/or his or her legal counsel on the petition for reorganization and will hear
the report from the delegated judge. After such hearing, the court will rule within eight days on the petition for judicial
reorganization. If the conditions for judicial reorganization appear to be met, and all required documents have been
provided, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open, allowing a temporary moratorium for a
maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or of the judicial trustee in case of a procedure of transfer
under judicial authority) and pursuant to the report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be
extended by an additional period of up to six months. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size of the
business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the interest of the creditors,
the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six months.

The granting of the temporary moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to

pre-existing claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s assets from the time that
the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with limited exceptions. During the moratorium, the debtor can also
not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the debtor itself. During the duration of the moratorium, no
attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims. Creditors however retain the possibility to be granted legal
or contractual security.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial restructuring retain their conservatory

character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have a material adverse effect on the
situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of moveable or immovable property has already been
set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization

procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, provided that the receivables are pledged specifically to
that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take
enforcement measures against the estate of the initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during
the moratorium. A pledge on financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15,
2004 (the “Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantor, can be enforced
notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium (unless considered an abuse of right). In the
case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of payment default or if certain
other conditions are met. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not covered by
the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by co debtors, subject to certain
exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals. The moratorium also does not prevent the
voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the
continuity of the enterprise. However, in respect of an enforcement over pledged cash falling within the scope of the
Belgian Financial Collateral Act, the enforcement prohibition applies, with limited exceptions (notably in the event of a
payment default), if the judicial reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial
legal entity within the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but the
creditor is not such an entity.

During the judicial restructuring proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor continue to

exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of the court. However, upon request of the
debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator (ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to assist the debtor
during the moratorium and to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its assets or its activities. The court may also
appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice), upon the request of the debtor, any
interested party or the public prosecutor, in the event of manifestly grave shortcomings (kennelijk grove
_tekortkomingen/manquements graves et caractérisés) of the debtor or any of its corporate bodies threatening the_
continutity of the enterprise facing difficulties or its economic activities and provided such measures can preserve such
continuity, to either execise particular tasks indicated by the court, or to replace the debtor or any of its corporate bodies
for the duration of the moratorium, or if the debtor’s economic activities are endangered, insofar as such measure can
safeguard the continuity of the debtor. In addition, in the event of manifestly gross negligence (kennelijk grove fout/faute
_grave et caractérisée), the court may, upon the request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, appoint a_
temporary administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/administrateur provisoire) replacing the debtor’s corporate bodies for
the duration of the moratorium and charged with the management of the debtor. Furthermore, upon request of any
interested party or upon its own initiative, the court may decide that the company loses all or part of the management of
all or part of its assets or activities in case of important, precise and consistent indications (gewichtige, bepaalde en met
_elkaar overeenstemmende aanwijzigingen/indices graves, précis et concordants) that the conditions for bankruptcy are_
met.


-----

The delegated judge, appointed by the court to assist the debtor in achieving the goal of the reorganization, has

additional powers, including the power to request the court to end the reorganization procedure prematurely if he or she
considers that the debtor is clearly not in a state to ensure the continuity of the whole or part of its business.

The restructuring procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern. Consequently, the

initiation of the judicial reorganization proceedings does not terminate any contracts, and contractual provisions which
provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or approval of a restructuring
procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not be enforceable during such a procedure. Such
enforcement prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial
reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in the meaning of the
Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity but the creditor is not such an entity. A creditor
may not terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the restructuring procedure if the
debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a contract during

the restructuring procedure, provided that the debtor notifies the creditor, and that such default is necessary for the debtor
to be able to propose a reorganization plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the enterprise or its assets. The
exercise of this right does however not prevent the creditor from suspending in turn the performance of its own
obligations. The creditor can however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the
performance of its own obligations.

**_Judicial Restructuring by Amicable Settlement by Collective Agreement, or by Court-ordered Transfer of Enterprise_**

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable

settlement between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of (part of)
the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also depend on the position of the
court and/or third parties. The Law of 26 March 2021 has (temporarily) introduced an additional type of reorganization,
namely the pre-packaged insolvency procedure.

In the case of an amicable settlement, the debtor can draw up an agreement and joint payment scheme plan with

at least two creditors in order to settle its debts. The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its
payment obligations, e.g., in relation to interest payments, pending the negotiation of the agreement. Only the parties
thereto will be bound by the terms they have agreed. If an agreement is reached for reorganization purposes, it is
submitted to the court and entered into a register. Such an amicable settlement will remain enforceable in the event of a
later bankruptcy, subject to certain exceptions.

In the case of a judicial restructuring by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a restructuring plan during

the restructuring procedure.

The debtor must prepare a reorganization plan in which it includes a list of its creditors and of the amount of their

claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if
applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims, as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can
challenge the amounts and the ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed
amounts and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure or
definitively, on the condition that it has jurisdiction in that respect but that the decision relating to the dispute cannot be
taken in a sufficiently short time frame. In addition, the court can, at any time, in the event of absolute necessity and upon
the request of the debtor or by the creditor, change the amount and the ranking of the claim initially declared by the
debtor on the basis of new elements at the latest 15 days before the date on which the creditors will vote on the
reorganization plan. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month in advance
of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the amount of its claim will remain
unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the assistance of

the court-appointed administrator or enterprise mediator, as the case may be. The plan may include measures such as the
reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the conversion of debt into equity (Book XX of the
Belgian Code of Economic Law contains certain limitations, primarily in view of protecting employees of the debtor) and
may be based on a differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities. The maximum duration of the plan
is five years. The reorganization plan must be filed with the electronic registry managed by the Belgian bar associations
(www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to
ratify the reorganization plan prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the
creditors (both in headcount and in principal amount due) and ratified by the court will bind the debtor and all creditors,
including those who voted against it or did not vote and whether secured or not. The reorganization plan can bind
creditors who have a contractual lien over specific assets, pledgees, mortgagees and the so-called creditor-owners,


-----

provided that (i) interest is paid on the principal amount of their outstanding debts, and (ii) their rights are not suspended
for more than 24 months as of the ratification of the collective agreement by the court. Subject to certain conditions, this
period of 24 months may be extended by another 12 months. No other measures can be imposed on such creditors
without their individual agreement. The court may refuse ratification if the conditions of the judicial reorganization
proceeding were not met or if the proposed reorganization plan violates public policy.

To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following the ruling

declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its creditors individually of the
amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the debtor, as well as of details regarding security
interests, if applicable.

Under current Belgian law, a secured creditor may not be crammed down pursuant to a restructuring plan. As

from 1 May 2018, however, a secured claim could be crammed down pursuant to a restructuring plan to the extent it
exceeds (i) the amount recorded in the applicable register in case of registered security, (ii) the book value of pledged
receivables or (iii) in respect of other security, the going concern value of the secured assets. Consequently, the amounts
secured by the mortgage mandates and the business pledge mandates will not be taken into account when determining
which part of the secured claim is protected against a cram down and a creditor benefiting from a mortgage mandate or
business pledge mandate is not protected against cram down under such a mortgage mandate or business pledge mandate.
The court may refuse ratification if the conditions of the judicial restructuring act were not met, or if the proposed
restructuring plan violates public policy.

The court-ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in his petition

or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor or by any party who has an
interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the court can order such transfer in specific
circumstances. The price of the transferred assets should at least be equal to the liquidation value. In the case of
comparable offers, priority will be given to the offer guaranteeing employment by way of a social agreement. The
court-ordered transfer will be organized by one or more judicial administrators appointed by the court. Following the
transfer, the recourse of the creditors will in most cases be limited to the transfer price, subject to some limited
exceptions.

In the case of a court-ordered transfer, co-contractors of ongoing agreements can be forced to continue to perform

the agreement without their consent after the transfer (except in case of intuitu personae agreements), provided historical
debts under such agreement are paid.

**_Pre-packaged insolvency procedure_**

On March 21, 2021, the Belgian Parliament adopted a new act amending Book XX of the Belgian Economic

Law Code introducing a “pre-packaged insolvency procedure” in Belgium, allowing the debtor to confidentially test the
possibility of a court-assisted amicable arrangement or a collective agreement with creditors, outside the scope of formal
judicial reorganisation proceedings. During the negotiation phase, only a limited moratorium may be put in place which
may not exceed four months and by means of which the court may subject unwilling or malicious creditors to payment
terms and enforcement measures for certain creditors may be suspended. If the negotiations are successful, the pre-pack
proceedings may be transformed into formal judicial reorganization proceedings to have the amicable arrangement
sanctioned or the collective agreement put to vote on an expedited timetable. This measure was initially adopted for a
limited period, but was extended several times, most recently, pursuant to a Royal Decree dated July 12, 2022, until
March 31, 2023.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the public

prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of the debtor’s assets or by
the liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) in
accordance with the Recast Insolvency Regulation.

Once the court ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which

all creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification. Conditions for a bankruptcy order
(faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be in a situation of cessation of payments (staking van
_betaling/cessation de paiements) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit)._
Cessation of payments is generally considered as the inability of the debtor to pay its debts as they fall due. Such
situation must be persistent and not merely temporary. The mere fact that debts of a debtor exceed the value of its assets
does not mean that the bankruptcy conditions are met. Companies in liquidation can be declared bankrupt up to six
months after the judgments of the closing of the liquidation. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision


-----

rights concerning the management of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur) becomes
responsible for the operation of the business and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the distribution of the sale
proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in the process are limited to being informed
of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis by the receiver.

The receiver must decide whether or not to temporarily continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e.,

contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The receiver may decide to continue the business of the debtor, provided
the receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors.
However, two exceptions apply:

(a) the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an
automatic early termination or acceleration event; and

(b) _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential_
element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment,
since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to
continue to perform under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party which are still to be

performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy if
such decision is necessary for the management and liquidation of the bankrupt estate. The counterparty to that agreement
may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy (and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured
creditors) and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not seek injunctive
relief or require specific performance of the contract.

The enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of the court order opening

bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy trustee may proceed against the debtor and
liquidate its assets.

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets (other than financial collateral), such suspension would

normally be limited to the period required for the first report of verification of the claims. At the request of the
bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment, provided
that such extension requires a specific order of the court, which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for
a realization of the assets in the interest of all creditors but without prejudicing the secured creditors, and provided that
those secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, such suspension does not
apply to a pledge of financial instruments or cash held on account.

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is necessary

to pursue the sale of the assets, subject to certain exceptions. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given
either at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to pursue the
enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the first report of claims has been finalized. The court may suspend such
enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy if the suspension will allow for a
realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to
be heard by the court.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time insolvency proceedings are

initiated, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such security shall, in accordance
with the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, not be affected by the initiation of such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on its unsecured

debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, such as tax debts or social security debts.

The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules. The following

is a general overview of such rules:

(a) Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings, the
so-called “estate debts,” have a senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to the
realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in priority out of
the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured creditors. Tax and
social security claims incurred during the judicial reorganization proceedings will be preferential debts
of the estate in a subsequent liquidation or bankruptcy;


-----

(b) Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured asset
(whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization);

(c) Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (e.g., tax claims, claims for
social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges on all assets of the
debtor. Certain privileges prevail over security interests;

(d) Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of security
interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will be distributed by
the receiver among the unsecured creditors who rank pari passu (unless a creditor agreed to be
subordinated); and

(e) Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

Book XX of the Belgian Code of Economic Law provides that any assets, amounts and sums of distributions (such

as income generated by a new activity) received after a bankruptcy are excluded from the bankruptcy estate if their
relevant cause dates from after the bankruptcy.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Belgian company for the obligations of another group company must

be for the corporate benefit of the granting company.

The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis and consideration has to be given to any

direct and/or indirect benefit that the company would derive from the transaction. Two principles apply to such
evaluation: (i) the risk taken by the company in issuing the guarantee must be proportional to the direct and/or indirect
benefit derived from the transaction and (ii) the financial support granted by the company should not exceed its financial
capabilities.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable (i) by the

company for negligence in the management of the company and (ii) by third parties in tort. Moreover, the guarantee or
collateral could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the creditor that benefits from the guarantee
or collateral could be held liable for up to the amount of the guarantee. Alternatively, the guarantee or collateral could be
reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit, or the creditor may be held liable for any guarantee amount
in excess of such amount. These rules have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on
this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and collateral to secure liabilities of a direct or

indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate benefit, it is standard market
practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation language”
in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Belgium. Accordingly, the Purchase Agreement, the Indenture
and the security documents will contain such limitation language and the security and the guarantees of the Belgian
Guarantors will be so limited.

The Indenture will expressly provide, substantially to the effect that, the obligations of each Belgian Guarantor

under the guarantee clause of the Indenture:

(a) shall not include any liability which would constitute unlawful financial assistance (as determined in
article 5:152 or 7:227 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code); and

(b) shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the greater of (a) 90% of such Belgian
Guarantor’s net assets (as defined in article 5:142/7:212 of the Belgian Companies and Associations
Code) as shown in its most recent audited annual financial statements as approved at its meeting of
shareholders, and (b) the aggregate of the amounts, either directly or through one or more other
companies of the INEOS Group, made available to such Belgian Guarantor and its subsidiaries (if any)
using all or part of the proceeds of the Notes (increased by all interests, commissions, costs, fees,
expenses and other sums accruing or payable in connection with such amount).

**_Mandates and third-party rights_**

Due to the registration and other fees payable in connection with the grant of Belgian law mortgages in respect

of real property, the amounts secured under these security documents will be capped. Additional amounts will be secured


-----

by way of a mortgage. Pursuant to such mandates, the respective Belgian Guarantors will grant an irrevocable power of
attorney for the purposes of creating one or more mortgages over the relevant property on behalf of the Security Trustee.

The creation of mortgages pursuant to these mandates will not have any retroactive effect, i.e., the security

interest will be created as of the date of conversion of the mortgage mandate into a mortgage and will take rank at that
date. In addition, if a mortgage mandate is converted into a mortgage during the “hardening period” (verdachte
_periode/période suspecte) as security interest for a pre-existing debt, such security interest will not be enforceable against_
the bankrupt estate (niet tegenwerpelijk aan de boedel/inopposable à la masse).

In addition, various rights may have been granted or may exist in favor of third parties on some parcels of

immovable goods on which mortgages will be granted. These rights could either limit the rights of the Security Trustee
under the mortgage or impose an obligation that the prior consent of the relevant third party is obtained before the
mortgage is granted.

**_Trust_**

As there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under the present Belgian legal system, the precise

nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a security agent as agent or trustee for noteholders in
respect of security interests such as pledges are debated under Belgian law.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event that bankruptcy proceedings are governed by Belgian law, certain business transactions may be

declared ineffective against third parties if concluded or performed during a so-called “hardening period.”

Under Belgian law the hardening or suspect period is the period between the date of cessation of payments by

the bankrupt party until the date of the bankruptcy judgment. In principle, a debtor is deemed to have stopped paying its
debts as of the date of the bankruptcy judgment. The court issuing the bankruptcy order may determine, based on serious
and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier
than six months before the date of the bankruptcy judgment, except in cases where the bankruptcy order relates to a
company that was dissolved more than six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an
intent to defraud its creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined as being the date of
such decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the declaration of
bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period.”

The business transactions entered into during the hardening period which will be declared ineffective against

third parties include, among others, (i) transactions entered into on extremely beneficial terms, (ii) payments other than in
money for debts due, and (iii) security provided for existing debt.

The Belgian receiver may request the court to declare payments of a Belgian Guarantor during the hardening

period for debts due ineffective against third parties, provided that it can be proven that the creditor concerned was aware
of the cessation of payment of the company.

Finally, regardless of any declaration by the business court of a hardening period, transactions of which it can be

demonstrated that they have been entered into with fraudulent prejudice to third creditors may be declared ineffective
against third parties.

**_Grace Periods_**

In addition, enforcement rights may, like those of any other creditor, be subject to Article 5.201 of the Belgian

Civil Code.

Pursuant to the provisions of these articles, Belgian courts may, in any civil proceeding involving a debtor, defer

or otherwise reasonably reschedule the payment dates of payment obligations. Belgian courts can also decide that the
interest rate applicable be reduced if it is considered to exceed the normal rate applicable to similar debts.

**Canada**

In the event of the insolvency of INEOS European Holdings Limited, such insolvency proceedings could impact

the ability to recover under the Canadian Security. Canadian insolvency laws and applicable provincial legislation would
govern those proceedings (subject to laws or protocols that may be applicable to international insolvencies if proceedings
also occur in other jurisdictions, and those foreign proceedings are recognized by a Canadian court). The insolvency laws
of Canada and related provincial legislation may restrict, delay or limit certain of your rights and remedies, including in


-----

respect of priority of claims, the ability to obtain post-filing interest and other amounts and the duration of the insolvency
proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due on the Notes or the Security Documents to which
INEOS European Holding Limited is a party.

In Canada, there are two primary Federal statutes that govern insolvency and restructuring proceedings of

corporate debtors. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (the “BIA”) contains provisions for the liquidation of insolvent
companies (in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. Chapter 7 proceedings, although there are important
distinctions) and for the restructuring of corporations (in a manner loosely akin, in substance, to U.S. Chapter 11
proceedings, although there are important distinctions). Similar to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States, a
corporate debtor may be petitioned into bankruptcy (i.e., involuntary proceedings) or file for bankruptcy or
reorganization (i.e., voluntary proceedings). In addition to the BIA, Canada also has the Companies’ Creditors
Arrangement Act (“CCAA”), which is a restructuring statute that operates, in practice, in a manner loosely akin to U.S.
Chapter 11 proceedings (with important distinctions). CCAA proceedings are only available to insolvent debtor
companies having debts in excess of CDN$5 million (or such other amount prescribed by regulation under the CCAA).
Insolvency proceedings in Canada, whether under the BIA or the CCAA, are court-supervised.

Upon the bankruptcy of a debtor corporation, whether voluntarily or upon the application of a creditor, the BIA

imposes an automatic stay of any action, execution or other proceeding by unsecured creditors in respect of the debtor,
unless the creditors obtain leave of the applicable court to continue or commence the proceeding. In a liquidation (as
opposed to restructuring) context, the stay of proceedings does not generally apply to secured creditors, who are free to
exercise their rights of self-help or to otherwise realize on their security outside of the BIA. However, if requested by
formal motion, the court may, in exceptional cases, stay the rights of a secured creditor for up to six months. Upon
becoming bankrupt, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, all of a debtor’s assets (subject to very limited exceptions) vest
in the trustee in bankruptcy (subject to the rights of secured creditors with validly perfected security interests), at which
point the debtor no longer has any ability to deal with those assets. The trustee typically proceeds to liquidate the assets
and distribute the proceeds of the assets in accordance with the provisions of the BIA.

The BIA sets out the priority scheme for the payment of claims against a bankrupt debtor, which priority scheme

takes precedence over any operative priority scheme outside of bankruptcy. Subject to certain statutory priority claims
enumerated in the BIA (including, without limitation, “super priority” charge under the BIA against a debtor’s current
assets for certain employee wages as well as charges to secure certain unremitted source deductions and certain arrears in
pension plan contributions) and true trust claims, secured creditors have the right to look first to the assets charged by
their validly perfected security for payment. Thereafter, the BIA provides a list of preferred creditors who recover their
debts in priority to the general body of unsecured creditors. Preferred claims are paid to the extent of their statutory
priority, in order of their ranking, before any payments to lower-ranking preferred creditors or general unsecured
creditors. All other claims will be considered general unsecured claims and rank pari passu.

If there is any surplus after payment to the unsecured creditors, the balance will be used to pay interest from the

date of the bankruptcy at 5% per annum on all unsecured claims proved in the bankruptcy according to their priority. Any
remaining amount would then be available for shareholders. It is exceedingly rare for there to be surplus proceeds in
bankruptcy proceedings.

The proceeds resulting from the realization of the Canadian Security may not be sufficient to satisfy secured

claims.

Corporate restructurings in Canada may be implemented under either the BIA or the CCAA, with the latter

being more commonly used by larger corporations. In either case, a broad stay of creditors’ rights and enforcement
proceedings is generally implemented (in the case of the BIA by a statutory stay, and in the case of the CCAA by a
court-ordered stay). A CCAA stay generally applies to secured creditors, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under this
court-ordered protection, the debtor may formulate a restructuring proposal or plan or conduct an orderly wind-down or a
sale as a going concern. In the event of a restructuring proposal or plan, a double majority of the creditors (i.e., a simple
majority in number, having two-thirds in value of the claims in question) present and voting either in person or by proxy
at a meeting of creditors for each designated class or claims must approve the proposal or plan, and the proposal or plan
must then be sanctioned by the court. Secured creditors may be included in such a proposal or plan and thereby have their
secured claims compromised, reduced or deducted (in which case they may have a right to vote in a separate class) or
may be dealt with outside of the proposal or plan. As an alternative to a plan, or in addition, a debtor may effect the sale
of all or a portion of its assets in CCAA proceedings. Such sales may be structured as a conventional assets sale, in which
assets are transferred to the purchaser free and clear of liabilities and liens, or as a share sale, where the purchaser
acquires the shares of the debtor company and all or a portion of the debtor’s liabilities are vested out of the debtor by
court order. In the event of a sale, proceeds are generally distributed to creditors in accordance with the priority
established by statute and the court (which may differ in some respects from those in a bankruptcy under the BIA). The
court may also authorize the creation of priority charges ranking ahead of other creditors in both CCAA and BIA
restructurings (for example, for interim or debtor-in-possession financings, directors’ and officers’ indemnification and


-----

administration costs). A sale under BIA restructuring or CCAA out of the ordinary course requires approval by the court
with notice to the secured creditors likely to be affected by the proposed sale. The court may approve such sales absent a
vote by the creditors in certain circumstances.

The manner in which secured and unsecured creditors would be treated in a restructuring proposal or plan would

generally be proposed by a debtor in terms of such plan, subject to (i) the rights of creditors affected by the proposal or
plan to vote on such proposal or plan and (ii) approval by the court.

Where a debtor deals with its property in a manner that prejudices its creditors (particularly where such debtor is

or becomes thereafter insolvent), such transactions by the debtor may be subject to challenge by creditors, bankruptcy
trustees or other interested parties, and the scrutiny of the court as fraudulent preference, transfer-at-undervalue or other
reviewable transaction. Under Canadian Federal and provincial law, there are a number of statutory means to challenge
or void such transactions. Where a transaction subject to review is held to be contrary to Canadian law (including
because it preferred one creditor over others or resulted in a loss of value to the debtor estate), the transaction is subject to
being voided and a wide variety of possible remedies may be imposed.

Secured creditors may also enforce their security by, among other things, applying to the court for the

appointment of a receiver or a receiver/manager. The conduct of the receivership will be governed by provincial law and
the relevant provisions of the BIA and will be under the supervision of the court.

**England and Wales**

**_The United Kingdom’s Withdrawal from the European Union_**

The Issuer of the Notes and a number of the Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of England

and Wales (the “English Obligors”). Therefore, any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the English Obligors
would likely be commenced in England.

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the transition

period, which commenced on January 31, 2020 and expired on December 31, 2020 (the “Transition Period”), in which
case the unmodified Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings,
insolvency proceedings with respect to English Obligors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English
insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an
English Obligor has its COMI in an EU Member State, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast EU
Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant Member State and be subject to the
laws of that Member State (see “—European Union”). In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations
2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”), certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to
oversee insolvency proceedings of any English Obligor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of
operations where it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such
foreign jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available

in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any
company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its COMI in an EU Member State (other than
Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. An “establishment” is defined in the same way as under the
Recast EU Insolvency Regulation (see “—European Union”). While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction
over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will
significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other
jurisdictions.

The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations, which implemented the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border

Insolvency in the United Kingdom, allow a foreign representative to apply to the English courts for recognition of certain
foreign law insolvency proceedings. If recognition is granted, those foreign law proceedings may benefit from certain
protections, some of which may arise automatically (depending on the circumstances) and some of which are at the
discretion of the English courts. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of
arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters
relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention”) and the Lugano Convention 2007 (the
“Lugano Convention”) (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending application to accede to the latter, which was blocked
by the European Commission in 2021) where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles
of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 17,
2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).


-----

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area

of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to
the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention, or
whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to
such treaties, although an initial judgment from 2021 suggests that the latter approach may be followed.

English insolvency law may not be as favorable to the interests of investors as the laws of the United States or

other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that any English Obligor experiences financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings.

The Issuer’s obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantors and secured by security interests

over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of a guarantee against a
Guarantor and the enforceability of security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on

the guarantees or the security interests over the Collateral.

The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the

guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and therefore may limit any amounts that investors may receive in an
insolvency of an English Obligor.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security,

including: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such
cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing
to operate the charging company’s business) while in administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge
holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating
charge over the charged assets (provided that the floating charge has not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was
granted); (c) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of the insolvency officeholder) properly incurred in
a winding-up are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in
priority to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with
assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be
effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating
charge and meaning that there is a risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge
security; (e) floating charge security is subject to certain challenges under English insolvency law (see “—Challenges to
Guarantees and Security—Grant of Floating Charge”); (f) where the floating charge is not a security financial collateral
arrangement, floating charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension
scheme contributions and salaries owed to employees) and to ring-fencing for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority on
insolvency”); and (g) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge
without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in
respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an
administrator may deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to
promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the net proceeds from the disposal of the property
in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge holder.

Under English law, there is a possibility that a court could re-characterize fixed security interests purported to be

created by a security document as floating charges and the description given to security interests by the parties is not
determinative. Whether security interests labeled as fixed will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating
security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the
relevant chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is
exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the
chargee prior to crystallization, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating
charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge in the security documents.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

The relevant English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of

an English company in certain circumstances. An administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that the
relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” and that the administration order is reasonably likely
to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis
(unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets
is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities). Such insolvency is


-----

presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding
£750 or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). An administrator can also be appointed out of
court by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge and different procedures apply according
to the identity of the appointor.

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing

a company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for a company’s creditors
as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable,
and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a
distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to
creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency”).

In general, during the administration, no proceedings or other legal process may be commenced or continued

against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the
administrator. Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the relevant guarantees and
the Collateral could not be enforced while the relevant company was in administration without the permission of the
court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Security Trustee would obtain such permission
of the court or consent of the administrator.

Certain creditors of a company in administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s

property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to
a “security financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds
or tradable capital market debt instruments) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (the
“Financial Collateral Regulations”). If an English Obligor were to enter administration, it is possible that, to the extent
that it is not a financial collateral arrangement, the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be
enforced while it is in administration, without the leave of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, other
than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a secured creditor in preference to an
administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the administrator. Where the company is
already in administration no other receiver may be appointed and an administrative receiver may only be appointed with
the leave of a court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements

under the Insolvency Act 1986 (as amended) (the “Insolvency Act 1986”), dispose of the property of a company in
administration (including property subject to a floating charge).

In order to empower the Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court

to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant English Obligor must constitute a “qualifying floating
charge” for purposes of English insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the
qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document pre-dates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the
exceptions in the Insolvency Act 1986 to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to
constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the
relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company
or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of
the Insolvency Act 1986. The Security Trustee will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge
security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests, relate to the whole or substantially the whole of
the relevant English Obligor’s property and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Whether the
assets that are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the relevant
English Obligor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time and there
is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test. The most
relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital
market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986), which will apply if the Issuer of the Notes creates a debt
of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the
issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but is generally a rated, listed or
traded debt instrument).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by

the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if
the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which
the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge on certain grounds. If an administrator is appointed, any
administrative receiver will vacate office. Further, upon the appointment of an administrator, any receiver of part of the
company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a
charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (as defined in the Financial Collateral
Regulations).


-----

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a termination procedure applicable to companies incorporated under the laws of England and

Wales. There are three ways an English company may be placed into liquidation or “wound up,” being (1) Members’
Voluntary Liquidation (which is a procedure available to solvent companies only), (2) Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation,
and (3) Compulsory Winding-Up.

On the voluntary liquidation of an English company, there is no automatic statutory moratorium in place

preventing the holders of security interests from taking steps to enforce those security interests (although the liquidator or
any creditor or shareholder of the company in liquidation may apply to court for a stay). Where a company incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales is placed into liquidation, a creditor holding a valid mortgage, charge or other
security interest has four options: (1) to realize the security, apply the proceeds towards discharge of the secured debt,
and prove in the liquidation for any balance; (2) to retain the security and not prove in the liquidation; (3) to value the
security and prove for any shortfall between that value and the value of the debt; and (4) to surrender the security and
prove for the full amount of the debt.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary liquidation. In a

compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986, any disposition of the relevant company’s
property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. Subject to certain
exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from
the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all
proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company
without permission of the court.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the

office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into sterling at a single rate for each currency
determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the relevant date. If a creditor considers
the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court. Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into
liquidation or administration, holders of the Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that such
English Obligor went into liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes
may become entitled.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class

of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed
otherwise, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to
each creditor within a class.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

      - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in specific assets in
the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only to the extent of the
realizations from those secured assets or with respect to the asset in which they have a proprietary interest;

      - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of
priority in which expenses are paid);

      - Third ranking: these are divided into ordinary preferential creditors and secondary preferential creditors
with ordinary preferential creditors being paid in priority to secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary
preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work
done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (c) holiday pay
due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or
after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary
preferential debts rank equally. Secondary preferential debts include (x) the balance of insured bank and
building deposits above the statutory limit of amounts insured under the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme and (y) with respect to all insolvencies commencing on or after December 1, 2020, claims by HM
Revenue and Customs in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax, student loan
deductions, employee National Insurance contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions


-----

which are held by the company on behalf of other taxpayers such as employees and customers. As between
another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

      - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security, to the extent
of the realizations from those secured assets.

This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but

which, on a proper interpretation, was re-characterised or rendered as a floating charge.

However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined

below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

      - Fifth ranking:

            - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors any
unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as
secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed
Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

            - secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the
official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the
commencement of any administration which had been converted into a distributing administration.
However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the guarantees, such
interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured
assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

            - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid. This
however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the English Supreme Court
Lehman Brothers ruling dated 17 May 2017; and

      - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the

subordination language in the relevant documentation.

An insolvency practitioner of the company (e.g., administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will

generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the
benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge
realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of floating
charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000, or £800,000 in
relation to floating charges which come into existence on or after 6 April, 2020. The Prescribed Part must be made
available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Challenges to Guarantees and Security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security

and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or
liquidation within a specified period (as set out in more detail below) of the granting of the guarantee or security.
Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, he may
challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and charges:

_Transaction at an Undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for

an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the
creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue. There will only be a transaction
at an undervalue, if at the time of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was or becomes


-----

unable to pay its debts (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986). The transaction can be challenged if the English company
enters into liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years (in the case of a transaction entered into
between the relevant company and a person who is “connected” with that company, within the meaning of section 249 of
the Insolvency Act 1986 (a “Connected Person”)) or six months (in the case of a transaction entered into between the
relevant company and any person who is not a Connected Person, including where such beneficiary is a Connected
Person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English company grants the security interest
or the guarantee. A transaction might be subject to being set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company makes
a gift to a person, if the company receives no consideration or if the company receives consideration of significantly less
value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court generally will not
intervene if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its
business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. If the
court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court can make such order as it thinks fit to
restore the position to what it would have been in if the transaction had not been entered into. In any proceedings, it is for
the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent unless a beneficiary of the
transaction was a Connected Person, in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the Connected Person must
demonstrate the solvency of the English company in such proceedings. The Issuer cannot assure holders of the Notes that
in the event of insolvency, the granting of the security or the giving of the guarantees by companies incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales would not be challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support the
Group’s analysis that (in any event) the security and guarantees were entered into in good faith for the purposes described
above.

In general terms, in such circumstances the Courts of England and Wales have the power to make void such

transactions, or restore the position to what it would have been if the company had not entered into the transaction. If a
court voided any grant of security or giving of any guarantee as a result of a transaction at an undervalue or preference, or
held it unenforceable for any other reason, investors would cease to have any security over the grantor or a claim against
the Guarantor giving such guarantee.

_Preference_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator of an English company could apply to the court for

an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believes that the
creation of such security interest or such guarantee constituted a preference. There will only be a preference if, at the time
of the transaction or as a result of the transaction, the English company was or becomes unable to pay its debts (as
defined in the Insolvency Act 1986). The transaction can be challenged if the English company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a
Connected Person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a Connected Person, except where such beneficiary is a connected
person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the English company grants the security interest
or the guarantee. A transaction will constitute a factual preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the English
company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the
company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that
transaction not been entered into. If the court determines that the transaction constituted such a preference, the court has
very wide powers for restoring the position to what it would have been if that preference had not been given, which could
include reducing payments under the Notes and the guarantees (although there is protection for a third party who enters
into one of the transactions in good faith and without notice). However, for the court to do so, it must be shown that in
deciding to give the factual preference the English company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect.
In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the English company was insolvent at the
relevant time and that the company was influenced by a desire to produce the preferential effect, unless the beneficiary of
the transaction was a Connected Person, in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a
desire to produce the preferential effect and the Connected Person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was
no such influence.

_Transaction Defrauding Creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue and was made for

the purposes of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against a company, or
of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim, which that person is making or may make, the
transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person
who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction and, subject to certain conditions, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
and the U.K. Pensions Regulator, and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators. There is no time limit in the
English insolvency legislation within which the challenge must be made (subject to the normal statutory limitations
period) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of the transaction. If the court determines that
the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the


-----

position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims
of the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transaction_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The court can

review extortionate credit transactions entered into by an English Obligor up to three years before the day on which the
English Obligor entered into administration or went into liquidation. A transaction is “extortionate” if, having regard to
the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant
payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or it
otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing.

_Grant of Floating Charge_

Under English insolvency law, if an English Obligor is unable to pay its debts at the time of (or as a result of)

granting the floating charge, and the floating charge was granted within the specified period referred to below, then such
floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or goods or services supplied to, or any
discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Obligor at the same time as or after the creation of the floating
charge. The requirement for the English Obligor to be insolvent at the time of (or as a result of) granting the floating
charge does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a Connected Person and within the specified period referred
to below. If the floating charge is granted to a Connected Person, and the floating charge was granted within the specified
period referred to below, then the floating charge is invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or
goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English Obligor at the same time
as or after the creation of the floating charge, whether the relevant English Obligor is solvent or insolvent. The granting
of the charge can be challenged only if the relevant English Obligor enters into liquidation or administration proceedings
within a period of one year (if the beneficiary is not a Connected Person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a Connected
Person) from the date the relevant English Obligor grants the floating charge. However, if the Floating Charge qualifies
as a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003, the
floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in this paragraph. An administrator, or a liquidator (as
applicable), does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid. Any floating charge
created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid except to the extent of the value of the money paid to, or
goods or services supplied to, or any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant English company at the same
time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest), whether the relevant English company is solvent
or insolvent at the time of grant.

**_The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 25, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Bill 2020 received Royal Assent and took effect as

the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 on June 26, 2020 (the “Insolvency Act 2020”) (save for certain
temporary business protection measures which have retrospective effect from March 1, 2020). The Insolvency Act 2020
introduced a number of substantial and permanent changes to the insolvency regime of the United Kingdom including the
following:

_Moratorium_

The Insolvency Act 2020 introduces a new standalone moratorium to facilitate company restructurings. The

entry into a moratorium for companies incorporated in England and Wales would be similar to the current out of court
administrator appointment procedure, i.e., filing papers at court. A “moratorium monitor” (the “Monitor”) (an
insolvency practitioner and officer of the court) will file their consent to act and confirm that they have assessed the
company’s eligibility and that all moratorium qualifying conditions are satisfied. Costs incurred during a moratorium will
be treated in the same way as expenses in an administration. Where a company exits a moratorium and subsequently
enters administration or liquidation, any unpaid moratorium costs will have super priority over any costs or claims in the
administration or liquidation, including the expense of those later procedures.

The moratorium is intended to enable the company to reach an agreement with creditors and the Monitor will be

obliged to monitor whether it remains likely that the moratorium will result in the rescue of the company as a going
concern (which is one of the eligibility criteria for a company to avail itself of the moratorium).

The eligibility criteria require the directors to state that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to pay its

debts. A company which has entered into a moratorium, administration or company voluntary arrangement in the last
12 months is not eligible to enter into a moratorium. Certain categories of companies are excluded from being eligible
(including those “excluded” as parties to capital markets arrangements as more particularly described in the Insolvency
Act 2020).


-----

The moratorium shall last for an initial period of up to 20 business days beginning with the business day after

the day on which the moratorium comes into force, which may be extended (i) by the directors, for a period of a further
20 business days, (ii) with creditor consent for a total period of a year (including the initial 20 business day period), and
(iii) by the court for an unlimited period.

The moratorium imposes a general restriction on the enforcement or payment of debts, insolvency proceedings

and legal proceedings and the crystallization of floating charges. The moratorium also impacts the company’s ability to
engage in a range of corporate acts including those which relate to obtaining credit, the grant of security, entering into
market contracts, payment of certain pre-moratorium debts, disposal of property, disposal of hire-purchase property and
disposal of charged property free from charge.

The Monitor can terminate the moratorium on various grounds, including if the Monitor thinks that the

moratorium is no longer likely to result in the rescue of the company as a going concern, or is unable to pay moratorium
debts, or pre-moratorium debts for which the company does not have a payment holiday, as and when those debts fall
due.

Creditors and other persons affected by the moratorium are entitled to apply to the court to challenge the

Monitor’s actions. A creditor or member of the company may challenge the conduct of or continuation of the moratorium
on the ground that the interests of the company’s creditors or members generally are being unfairly harmed.

_Certain Ipso Facto Clauses To Be Rendered Ineffective_

The Insolvency Act 2020 renders ineffective termination clauses in contracts for the supply of goods and

services where the termination clause is activated by the purchaser of the goods or services becoming subject to a formal
insolvency procedure (so-called ‘ipso facto’ clauses). This provision does not apply in relation to certain types of
financial contracts, or where the company or the supplier are engaged in certain types of financial services.

_Restructuring Plan_

The Insolvency Act 2020 introduces a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement but with an

ability for cross class cramdown.

This standalone restructuring plan will be available to certain companies that have encountered, or are likely to

encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, their ability to carry on business as a going
concern. The compromise or arrangement proposed in the plan must have as its purpose the elimination, reduction or
prevention of, or mitigation of the effect of, any such financial difficulties.

The process closely resembles that for a scheme of arrangement. However, unlike a scheme of arrangement, to

commence this process, a restructuring plan proposal can be made not only by the company, but also any creditor or
member of the company, or if the company is being wound up, the liquidator, or if the company is in administration, the
administrator. Every creditor or member whose rights are affected should be able to participate in a meeting.

At a first hearing, the court may order the holding of a meeting of creditors, classes of creditors, members or

class of members. Before that meeting, a statement must be provided to the creditors, class of creditors or class of
members (as applicable) which statement must explain the effect of the compromise or arrangement. At the meeting, the
requisite voting threshold of 75% in value of the creditors, class of creditors or members (as applicable) present and
voting must be met before, at a second hearing, the court will consider whether to sanction the compromise or
arrangement.

Where a compromise or arrangement is approved by 75% in value of a class of creditors or members (as

applicable) present and voting who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the
event of the “relevant alternative” (i.e., whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the
company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned) then the court may still sanction the scheme even if one or more
classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court
is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class would be any worse off under the restructuring plan than they
would be in the event of the “relevant alternative”; and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number
representing 75% in value of a class of creditors or members (as applicable), present and voting, who would receive a
payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative referred to in
(i) above.


-----

_Statutory Demands and Winding-Up Petitions_

Under section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986 certain transactions, including any disposition of the company’s

property and any transfer of shares made after the commencement of a winding-up, unless sanctioned by the court, are
void. Where a creditor makes a winding-up petition during the period set out above and the court makes an order for a
winding-up of the company, the Insolvency Act 2020 shifts the point in time at which a winding-up will be deemed to
commence for the purposes of section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986 from the time of the presentation of the
winding-up petition to the making of the winding-up order. Therefore, transactions that are entered into after the
presentation of a winding-up petition during the ‘relevant period’ but prior to the making of the winding-up order will not
be void.

**_Ranking of Security Interests_**

Under English law, there are certain common law rules and equitable principles which will determine the

ranking of two or more competing security interests over the same assets. A number of different factors are taken into
account, such as the nature of the security interest, the order of creation, compliance with perfection requirements and the
order of giving notice. English law security interests are to be granted to secure obligations under the Notes (which will
also extend to obligations under the Senior Secured Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging
liabilities and certain cash management liabilities); these security interests will be granted over the same assets in respect
of which security interests have already been granted in favor of the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans.
Accordingly, without the Intercreditor Deed, these new security interests would be likely to rank after the existing
security interests. However, the Intercreditor Deed provides that as a contractual matter as among Senior Secured
Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Deed) the Notes will be secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured
Term Loans, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities and
will be treated as such for the purposes of the application of proceeds from the enforcement of such assets.

**_Disclaimer_**

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other

property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any
other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing
financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to an
executed contract, nor can it disturb accrued rights and liabilities.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of another

group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the
respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an
action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the
respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an
English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further,
corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed
transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in
good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole.
If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing
their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.

**_Security Over Shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English Obligor are, under English law,

equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance over the
property in favor of the chargee but the chargor retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges
may be subject to equitable considerations or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

**_Security Over Bank Accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each, an “Account Charge”) granted by an English Obligor,

the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each, an “Account Bank”) may hold a right at any time (at least
prior to them being notified of a crystallisation event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or
set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that guarantor. As a result, and if
the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those
bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the


-----

bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a
fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant
English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to
the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act 1986, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator as

applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a
compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the
company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision
procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal. A company voluntary
arrangement cannot affect the right of a secured creditor to enforce its security, or of a preferential creditor to be paid in
priority to non-preferential creditors (see “—Priority on insolvency”), except with the consent of the secured creditor or
the preferential creditor (as applicable).

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by

value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement. However,
a secured creditor may vote to the extent that it is undersecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary
arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security.

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the English courts

have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a
company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Obligor may be able to pursue a scheme in respect of
its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Guarantor which is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act 1986 and
has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also pursue a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely
to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the
company’s COMI is in England or Wales, the company’s finance documents are English law-governed, or the company’s
finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each
case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether
or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement at a hearing where the fairness and

reasonableness of the scheme will be considered, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or
arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors
that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such
compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value
of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme,
irrespective of the terms and approved thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to
the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in
the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction
hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has the
discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made
or reject the scheme.

**France**

Security over shares held by INEOS Investments International Limited in certain of its French subsidiaries shall

be pledged under French law. Therefore, an insolvency event (including any insolvency proceedings resulting therefrom)
affecting such French subsidiaries may significantly reduce the value of such security interests for their beneficiaries. In
the event of an insolvency event affecting such French subsidiaries, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in France
and would then be governed by French law (subject to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation (see “Limitations on
Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—European Union”)).

**_Trust_**

The security interests governed by French law are stated to be granted in favor of Barclays Bank PLC as trustee

and security agent on behalf of the specified secured parties. There is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under
the present French legal system. A concept of “trust” has been recognized for tax purposes by article 792-0 bis of the
_Code Général des Impôts and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held, in a decision dated September 13,_


-----

2011 rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings in France, that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed
by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings opening in France.
However, France has not ratified the 1985 The Hague Convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition,
so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law and the precise nature, effect and
enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a security agent as agent or trustee for noteholders in respect of security
interests such as pledges are unclear under French law.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor

be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties who do not hold the
secured claim, unless they act as trustees (fiduciaires) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agents
(agent des sûretés) under Article 2488-6 of the French Civil Code, which is not the case here for the security documents
governed by French law. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the security
documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes to benefit indirectly from a secured claim, the Indenture will
provide for the creation of a “parallel debt” governed by New York law in favor of the security trustee. Pursuant to such
parallel debt, the security trustee becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by a relevant obligor under
the Indenture. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the parallel debt, and will not directly secure the
obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral.

Although the concept of parallel debt was held to be not incompatible with the French law concept of

international public policy in a French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) decision dated September 13, 2011 in the
context of safeguard proceedings opened in France, this decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of the
enforceability in France of the rights of a security trustee benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no assurance can
be given that such a structure will in all circumstances be upheld by the French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the
legal issue addressed by this decision is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally
uphold French security interests securing a parallel debt. Case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case
analysis.

There is no certainty that the parallel debt construct will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under

French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the parallel debt construct are
successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the
security interests in the Collateral, which in turn could materially adversely affect the recovery under the Collateral. In
addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the security
trustee.

**_Assumptions as to the enforceability of twelfth ranking financial securities account pledges over the shares of INEOS_**
**_Technologies France SAS and thirteenth ranking financial securities account pledges over the shares of INEOS_**
**_France SAS_**

Each of the pledges over the shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and INEOS France SAS, governed by

French law, is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the
shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and INEOS France SAS are respectively registered. In France, no lien
searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts
(nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over
the relevant securities account in which the shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and INEOS France SAS are
respectively registered.

Prior to January 1, 2022, French law did not expressly mention the possibility of granting lower ranking or

subsequent pledges over a securities account already subject to a first ranking security interest. As the granting of a
pledge of a securities account pursuant to French law is deemed to remove the securities registered on such account from
the possession of the pledgor and grant possession to the pledgee, some scholars and practitioners regarded the granting
of such lower or subsequent pledges as requiring the appointment, by the beneficiaries of such lower ranking or
subsequent pledges, of the beneficiaries of the first ranking secured interest as a “tiers convenu” (entiercement), whose
role was to hold such possession for the benefit of all secured creditors (regardless of the ranking). Since January 1, 2022,
however, article L.211-20 I.bis of the French Monetary and Financial Code expressly mentions the possibility of several
successive pledges of the same securities account and provides that the ranking among creditors be determined pursuant
to the date of the statements of pledges of lower ranking or subsequent rankings to the financial securities account holder.

Although French law now recognizes the possibility of granting subsequent pledges without any appointment of

a tiers convenu and because the agreements granting the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth,
tenth and eleventh ranking pledges and (with respect to the shares of INEOS France SAS) the twelfth ranking pledge
provide for the appointment of tiers convenu in order to comply with the previous practice (described above) which was


-----

prevailing among scholars and practitioners at the time of execution of such agreements, the twelfth ranking financial
securities account pledge agreement of the shares of INEOS Technologies France SAS and the thirteenth ranking
financial securities account pledge agreement of the shares of INEOS France SAS also provide that (i) the possession of
the securities accounts is transferred to the custody of an agreed third party as tiers convenu and (ii) the first ranking
secured parties have accepted their appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as custodian for the
benefit of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh ranking secured parties and
(with respect to the thirteenth ranking financial securities account pledge agreement over the shares of INEOS France
SAS) the twelfth ranking secured parties. No assurance can be given that such tiers convenu would be upheld if tested in
front of a French court.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain Guarantors of the Notes or providers of security for the Notes are organized or incorporated under the

laws of Germany (the “German Guarantors”). Consequently, in the event of an insolvency of any such Guarantor,
subject to the information presented in “—European Union,” insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Germany. Such
proceedings would then be governed by German law. However, pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, where
a German company conducts business in more than one member state of the European Union, the jurisdiction of the
German courts may be limited if the company’s COMI is found to be in a member state other than Germany (see “—
European Union”). There are a number of factors that are taken into account to ascertain the COMI, which should
correspond to the place where the company conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore
ascertainable by third parties. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant
insolvency proceedings are opened. The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German
Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung) may be less favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency law of other
jurisdictions including in respect of the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of
the insolvency proceedings.

Under German law, insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of

over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) or illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor. The debtor is over-indebted if its
liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation value) unless its continuation as a going concern is
predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich). The debtor is illiquid if it is unable to pay its debts as and when they
fall due. In addition, the debtor may, but is not obliged to, file for insolvency proceedings if it is imminently at risk to be
unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit). If the debtor is a company with limited
liability (such as each of the German Guarantors), the management of the debtor is obliged under the Insolvency Act to
immediately file for insolvency proceedings in the case of an over-indebtedness or illiquidity. Subject to the new
Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (as defined in “Preventive Restructuring Framework” below), the
management of a company with limited liability (such as each of the German Guarantors) has the right, as long as the
company is not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) to initiate a voluntary preinsolvency restructuring procedure. If the company
has commenced a procedure for the voluntary restructuring under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the
obligation to file for insolvency is suspended as long as the restructuring procedure is pending.

The insolvency proceedings are court-controlled, and upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency

court may take preliminary protective measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings.
The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets
during these preliminary proceedings and may appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter) who, depending on the court decision, may have the right to manage and dispose of the business and_
assets of the debtor. During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court generally must set up a
“preliminary creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor has satisfied at least two of the
following three requirements in its previous financial year: a balance sheet total in excess of €6,000,000 (after deducting
an equity shortfall if the debtor is over indebted), revenues of at least € 12,000,000 and/or fifty or more employees on
average. The requirements apply to the respective entity without taking into account the assets of other group companies.
If these requirements are not met, a preliminary creditors’ committee can be established at the request of the preliminary
insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) or a creditor. The preliminary creditors’ committee will be
able to participate in certain important insolvency court decisions. It will have, for example, the power to influence the
following: the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator or an insolvency administrator (vorläufiger
_Insolvenzverwalter and Insolvenzverwalter), orders for “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Anordnung der_
_Eigenverwaltung), and appointments of preliminary trustees (Sachwalter). The court opens the insolvency proceedings_
(Insolvenzeröffnung) if certain formal requirements are met and if there are sufficient assets to cover at least the costs of
the proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open main
insolvency proceedings if third parties, for instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such
advancement, the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse). If insolvency proceedings are opened, the court appoints an insolvency administrator


-----

(Insolvenzverwalter) unless debtor-in-possession (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of debtor-in-possession
proceedings, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the debtor passes to the
insolvency administrator. The insolvency administrator has full power to manage the business and dispose of the debtor’s
assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to manage the business or dispose of its assets. The insolvency
administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations or may
deem it necessary to wind down the company, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate
(Masseschulden) will be preferred to any insolvency liabilities created by the debtor (including secured debt).

For the holders of the Notes, the most important consequences of such opening of formal insolvency

proceedings that are subject to the German insolvency regime (against a German Guarantor or against any other
Guarantor having its COMI in Germany and where the German insolvency courts have jurisdiction in accordance with
the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation or the German Insolvency Act) would be the following:

      - the right to administer and dispose of assets of the relevant insolvent debtor would generally pass to the
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate, unless
debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) are ordered;

      - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals effected by
management of the insolvent debtor after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings are null and void by
operation of law;

      - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings, a creditor in the
insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in part of the
insolvent debtor’s property that would normally form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes
null and void by operation of law upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings; and

      - claims against the insolvent debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules set forth in
the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses” entitling

one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement, upon the opening of
insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or the occurrence of reasons justifying the
opening of insolvency proceedings (insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte or Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid if they
frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or not to perform the contract unless they reflect
termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German
law in the event insolvency proceedings are opened in Germany against the counterparty. All creditors, whether secured
or unsecured, unless they have a right to segregate an asset from the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht)—as
opposed to a right of preferential satisfaction from realization proceeds (Absonderungsrecht)—who wish to assert claims
against the debtor need to participate in the insolvency proceedings. Any individual enforcement action
(Zwangsvollstreckung) brought against the debtor by any of its creditors other than creditors with preferred claims
(Absonderung der Masseverbindlichkeiten) is subject to an automatic stay once insolvency proceedings have been
opened. Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security interests outside the insolvency proceedings.
However, secured creditors have certain preferential rights. The enforcement proceeds minus certain contributory charges
for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a
security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining amounts are distributed
among the unsecured creditors. If a German Guarantor grants security over its assets to other creditors than the holders of
the Notes, such security may result in a preferred treatment of creditors secured by such security. The proceeds resulting
from such collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the holders of the relevant Notes under the guarantees granted by the
German Guarantors after such secured creditors have been satisfied. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can
be proposed in an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator
and requires the consent of the debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific
majority rules. Under German insolvency laws, it is possible to implement a debt-to-equity-swap through an insolvency
plan. However, it will not be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such
debt-to-equity-swap.

If a company faces imminent illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness, it may also file for preliminary

“debtor-in-possession” proceedings. In such a case and upon request of the debtor, the court will prohibit enforcement
measures (other than with respect to immoveable assets) and may implement other preliminary measures to protect the
debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During such period, the debtor shall, together with its
creditors and a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter), prepare an insolvency plan which ideally will be
implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have
been opened.


-----

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies in

the event of insolvency. In case of a group of companies, each entity, from an insolvency law point of view, has to be
dealt with separately (i.e., there is generally no group insolvency concept under German insolvency law). As a
consequence, there is, in particular, no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of
and vis-à-vis each entity have to be dealt with separately. On April 21, 2018, the Bill to Facilitate the Handling of Group
Insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) entered into force. While the bill does
not abolish the principle of separate insolvency proceedings in relation to each group entity, it provides for the following
four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to facilitate an efficient administration of group
insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group entity’s insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a
single person as insolvency administrator for all group companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are
imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply
for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency
administrator” (Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be subordinated by law (in particular, but not limited to,

claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or
economically equivalent claims), while certain claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only
after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of
subordinated creditors in the insolvency proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims
of other non-subordinated creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied. See also below
under “—Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims”.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The Guarantors of the Notes that are organized under German law are incorporated or established in the form of

a GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, Limited Liability Company), or (in the case of one of the Guarantors)
as a GmbH & Co. KG, a limited partnership with a GmbH (Limited Liability Company) as its sole general partner.
Consequently, the grant of Collateral by these Guarantors is subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability
Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, the “GmbHG”).

Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its

shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets determined in accordance with the provisions of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, the HGB) (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves) is or would
fall below the amount of its stated share capital (Begründung einer Unterbilanz) or would increase any already existing
capital impairment (Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz). Guarantees, share pledges and any other collateral granted by a GmbH
in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements
under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees and collateral to secure
liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard
market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security documents to contain so-called “limitation
language” in relation to subsidiaries in the legal form of a GmbH or a limited partnership with a GmbH as its sole general
partner incorporated or established in Germany. Pursuant to such limitation language, the secured parties agree to enforce
the collateral (or retain the proceeds of an enforcement of the collateral) and the beneficiaries of the guarantees agree to
enforce the guarantees against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such enforcement does not result in the
subsidiary’s net assets falling below its stated share capital. Accordingly, the documentation in relation to the guarantees
and the security interests, to the extent they concern the German Guarantors, contains such limitation language and such
guarantees and security interests are limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the
respective guarantee or security granted by a GmbH cannot be enforced at all. Details of the application of Sections 30
and 31 (or capital maintenance rules) are subject to evolving case law. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the case
law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) regarding so-called destructive interference
(existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a shareholder deprives a German limited liability company of the
liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement
of a guarantee or security interest granted by a German (direct or indirect) subsidiary or sister company of the Issuer. In
such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be reduced, even to zero.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to ongoing court decisions. We cannot assure you that future court

rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of a limited
liability company or of a limited partnership, the general partner or general partners of which is or are a limited liability
company, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuer to make payment on the Notes, of the German Subsidiaries
to make payments on the guarantees, of the secured parties to enforce the collateral (or retain the proceeds of an
enforcement of the collateral) or of the beneficiaries of the guarantees to enforce the guarantees.


-----

In addition to the limitations resulting from the capital maintenance rules, the guarantees and the security

documents entered into by the German Guarantors will contain additional provisions which may limit the enforcement in
the event the enforcement would result in an illiquidity of the relevant German Guarantors.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee

and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held for the benefit of a third party by a pledgee
who does not itself hold the secured claim. The holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be party to the
security documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have a secured claim, the
Intercreditor Deed provides for an abstract acknowledgment of indebtedness in favor of the Security Trustee (“parallel
debt”). Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security Trustee becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by
an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by German law will directly secure the parallel debt. The parallel debt
concept is widely used in the German market, but has not been tested under German law, and there is no certainty that it
will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate mainly (apart from, among other things, costs of the insolvency proceedings and claims of

a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings) serves to
satisfy the liquidated claims held by creditors of the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened.
The following claims shall be satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below,
and according to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued
on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by
individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines
and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the
debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for repayment
of a shareholder loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic
terms to such a loan unless a state aid bank or any of its subsidiaries which is a shareholder of the relevant company has
granted the respective loan or legal transaction corresponding in economic terms to such a loan. Under certain pandemicrelated temporary relief laws enacted in March 2022, the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables
from economically similar acts in insolvency proceedings has been suspended; however, this suspension only applies for
shareholder loans that were newly granted between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2021 and only subject to additional
requirements, and is expected to end on September 30, 2023.

**_Ranking of Security Interests_**

Under German law, the ranking of several security interests over the same assets is determined, as a matter of

law, by the timing of the perfection of the several security interests, and security interests perfected at an earlier point in
time will have a higher rank than security interests granted at a later point in time over the same assets
(Prioritätsgrundsatz). The German law security interests granted to secure the Notes are expressed to cover the same
assets as the security interests already granted to secure the obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities. Whereas the German law
“non-accessory” security interests granted to secure the obligations under the Notes will be granted by way of
amendments to the security purpose under the existing security interests granted originally to secure the obligations under
the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash
management liabilities, with the effect that the obligations under the Notes will be included in the security purpose and
accordingly also be secured, the German law “accessory” security interests to secure the obligations under the Notes will
have to be granted as junior ranking security interests, which, as a matter of law will rank below the corresponding
accessory security interests granted to secure the obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured
Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities. Although the Intercreditor Deed provides
that, as amongst the parties, security interests to secure obligations under the Notes, Existing Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Term Loans, certain hedging liabilities and certain cash management liabilities shall rank pari passu,
these provisions under the Intercreditor Deed are only of an obligatory nature and cannot enhance the junior rank of the
accessory security interests (i.e., the pledges over accounts, shares and partnership interests) granted to secure the
obligations under the Notes. In the event of insolvency proceedings opened under German law against a security grantor
of such junior ranking accessory security interests, the preferential rights of the secured parties under such junior ranking
security interests would be satisfied after the preferential rights of the secured parties under the senior ranking accessory
security interests over the same assets, regardless of the provisions of the Intercreditor Deed.

Under German law, it is unclear whether all of the security interests in the Collateral give the Security Trustee a

right to prevent other creditors of the German Guarantors from foreclosing into and realizing the Collateral. Some courts
have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority (according to their rank) in the


-----

distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Trustee and the noteholders may not be able to
avoid foreclosure by unsecured creditors into the Collateral, even if they consider such foreclosure untimely.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event that insolvency proceedings with respect to a German Guarantor, which would most likely be based

on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the security interests granted as well as the guarantee provided by
that entity could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) under the rules of
avoidance as set out in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung).

Based on these rules, an insolvency administrator may challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to

insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Such transactions can
include the payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes as well as granting them any security interest. The
administrator’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the
10-year period prior to the filing of the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings. In the event such a
transaction is successfully avoided, the holders of the Notes would be under an obligation to repay the amounts received
or to waive the guarantee or security interest.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the provision of

security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

      - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
(i) if such act was performed during the last three months prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time
when such act was taken and the creditor had knowledge of such illiquidity (or of the circumstances that
unmistakably suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) if such act was performed after the
filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the creditor had knowledge
of the illiquidity of the debtor or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances unmistakably suggesting
such illiquidity or filing);

      - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction
to which such creditor was not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or
at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction if (i) such act was performed during
the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or
after such filing, (ii) such act was performed during the second or third month prior to the filing of the
petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time, or (iii) such act was performed during the second or third
month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and the
creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the other insolvency creditors
(or had knowledge of circumstances that unmistakably suggest such detrimental effects);

      - any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the debtor
loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is obtained or
becomes enforceable, if (i) it was entered into during the three months prior to the filing of the petition of
the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, the debtor was illiquid at the time of such transaction
and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) it was entered
into after such filing and the counterparty to such transaction had knowledge of either the debtor’s
illiquidity or such filing at the time of the transaction;

      - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (for example, whereby a debtor grants security for a
third-party debt), which might be regarded as having been granted gratuitously (unentgeltlich), if it was
effected in the four years prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings
against the debtor;

      - any act performed by the debtor in the 10 years prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of
insolvency proceedings with the intent (known to the beneficiary of the act at the time of such act) to
prejudice its creditors; if the relevant act consisted of a settlement of an obligation or the grant of the
security to the counterparty, the relevant period is four years instead of 10 years; “knowledge by the
beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was
imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other
creditors; if the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a creditor to obtain, security or satisfaction in a
form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the
act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; the fact that the creditor_


-----

agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to deferred payments establishes a presumption that he
had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at that time;

      - any contract entered into by the debtor in the last two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings with a closely related party (which term includes in particular the management,
supervisory board members and shareholders of the debtor owning more than 25% of the debtor's share
capital, certain persons with comparable access to information about the debtor, and certain of their or its
affiliates, management and relatives) and which is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors, unless
the closely related party was unaware of the debtor’s intent to prejudice its creditors;

      - any act that provides security or satisfaction for a shareholder loan made to the debtor or a similar claim if
(i) in the case of the provision of security, the act occurred during the 10 years prior to the filing of the
petition for the commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or (ii) in
the case of satisfaction, the act occurred during the last year prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition; and

      - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third party if (i) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security or was liable as a guarantor (Bürge) (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor
for the amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the

conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the
insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the
insolvency creditors if it was aware of the debtor’s actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or impending illiquidity
(drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors, provided that, if the relevant
act by the debtor consisted of a settlement of an obligation or the grant of a security which was due to be paid or granted,
as the case may be, then the knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors is only presumed if
the other party was aware of the actual illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the debtor and of the fact that the transaction
prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to a “related party,” there is a general statutory presumption that such
party had “knowledge.”

If any of the guarantees given or any security interest granted by any of the German Guarantors were avoided or

held unenforceable for any reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect thereof. Any amounts received from a
transaction that has been avoided would have to be repaid to the insolvent estate and you would have a claim solely under
the Notes and the remaining security, if any.

Furthermore, even in the absence of an insolvency proceeding, a third-party creditor who has obtained an

enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) but has failed to obtain satisfaction on its enforceable claims by a levy of
execution, under certain circumstances, has the right to avoid certain transactions, such as the payment of debt and the
granting of security pursuant to the German Code on Avoidance (Anfechtungsgesetz). The conditions for avoidance under
the German Code on Avoidance differ to a certain extent from the above-described rules under the German Insolvency
Act and the avoidance periods are calculated from the date when a creditor exercises its rights of avoidance in the courts.
In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing, funding to a debtor or obtained
security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of
circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time such funding was provided or extended or
such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if,
for example, the creditor was to act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of
the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the
beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the guarantee or
security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto. Furthermore,
according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security or guarantee agreement
may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor is aware of the debtor’s distressed financial
situation and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other
business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting of
guarantees and/or security interests to be granted by the German Guarantors.

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

On June 20, 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a new directive, which aims to ensure that

minimum restructuring measures are available in the member states to enable debtors in financial distress to solve their


-----

problems at an early stage and to avoid formal insolvency proceedings (Directive of the European Parliament and the
Council EU 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on
measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and
amending directive (EU) 2017/1132 (the “Preventive Restructuring Directive”)).

In Germany, the Preventive Restructuring Directive was implemented by the law on the Further Development of

the German Restructuring and Insolvency Laws, which became effective on January 1, 2021. An essential part of the law
is the introduction of a new Act on a Stabilisation and Restructuring Framework for Enterprises (“Company
**Stabilisation and Restructuring Act”), which establishes a comprehensive legal framework for out-of-court**
restructurings in Germany. Proceedings under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act (“Restructuring
**Proceedings”) are initiated through a notification by the respective debtor to affected creditors or the competent**
restructuring court (Anzeige des Restrukturierungsvorhabens).

A debtor can access the new restructuring tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act upon the

occurrence of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) which is triggered when it is likely that the debtor
will not be able to meet its future payment obligations that fall due over (generally) the next 24 months. The debtor’s
management is not obliged to make use of the tools of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act. Therefore, the
debtor may alternatively file for regular insolvency proceedings if the respective requirements are met (see above under
“—Insolvency”).

Unlike insolvency proceedings, the tools under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act do not

necessarily cover all of a debtor’s liabilities, as the debtor has a certain amount of flexibility under the Company
Stabilisation and Restructuring Act to adapt the scope of the available tools to cover either all of the debtor’s liabilities,
only certain types (e.g., financial liabilities, including under the Notes), or only selected liabilities. In addition and
depending on the extent to which a debtor requires to make use of certain legal tools available under the Company
Stabilisation and Restructuring Act, the involvement of the competent restructuring court can be kept to a minimum and
the tools can – under certain circumstances – even be used without the need for any public notices despite being binding
on affected creditors. The tools available under the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act may in the case of a
group of companies only be used for each entity separately (an important exception is the ability to extend the effect of
certain tools to cover security granted by entities that are connected entities (verbundene Unternehmen) of the debtor).
However, the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for an application mutatis mutandis of the
provisions of the German Insolvency Code which implemented the law to facilitate the mastering of group insolvencies
(see above under “—Insolvency”).

The core component of the Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act is an out-of-court restructuring of a

debtor’s liabilities via a restructuring plan, including, e.g., by way of changes to the principal amounts, interest rates or
maturities of liabilities. Such restructuring plan may also negatively impact (including, e.g., a release of) collateral
granted for the benefit of the Notes by the debtor as well as its subsidiaries, parent and sister companies. A restructuring
plan can generally be adopted and become binding for creditors upon being approved by the required majority or
majorities of a debtors’ creditors. The restructuring plan will be voted on in classes. The adoption of the restructuring
plan requires, in principle, that in each class a majority of three-quarters of the voting rights approve the plan (whereas
voting rights are determined by the amount of the claim, the value of the security and, in the case of share or membership
rights, the share of the subscribed capital of the debtor). However, if more than one class is formed, the restructuring plan
can even be adopted and become binding on creditors if creditor class(es) have not approved the plan, provided certain
requirements are met and the restructuring court confirms the restructuring plan (cross-class cramdown).

The Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act provides for additional tools that may be used by the debtor

so as to facilitate the preparation, negotiations and implementation of a restructuring plan. These tools include a
stabilisation order by the restructuring court (which is granted upon the application by the debtor). Such stabilisation
order can restrict enforcement measures by certain or all creditors. The stabilisation order can initially be granted for a
maximum period of up to three months, with subsequent orders to extend the stabilisation order up to a maximum of
eight months subject to certain conditions being satisfied.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of the use of any tools available under the

Company Stabilisation and Restructuring Act by a Guarantor which has its COMI in Germany would be the following:

  - the negotiation and drafting of a restructuring plan by the relevant Guarantor is potentially subject to no or only
limited review or supervision by a court;

  - restrictions on individual enforcement or foreclosure actions for all or certain creditors for a period of up to eight
months due to a stabilisation order;

  - any claims and rights of the holder of the Notes against the relevant Guarantor can be subject to and potentially
be compromised by the restructuring plan (e.g., in relation to claims in the form of a reduction in principal or


-----

interest or a deferral and in relation to security rights in the form of a release and an adjustment of the ranking of
the security right);

  - any collateral granted by the relevant Guarantor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to Restructuring
Proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral; and

  - a restructuring plan can be adopted and the measures therein can become binding on any holder of the Notes
without the consent of each holder of the Notes and, if the prerequisites for a cross-class cram-down are fulfilled,
even without the consent of any of the holders of the Notes.

Restructuring plans which are public and confirmed by a German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU
member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings) upon such proceeding being included as a
recognized proceeding in Exhibit A of that Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is
subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: désastre and winding-up (including just and

equitable winding up and creditors’ winding up). Under Jersey law, creditors and debtors can apply for an Act of the
Royal Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”)
declaring the property of a debtor to be “en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of désastre, title and possession
of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With
effect from the date of declaration, a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may
not commence or, except with the consent of the Viscount or Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the
debt. With effect from the date of declaration, a secured party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and
without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security
Interests) of the Security Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Security Law”). If the proceeds of such enforcement are
insufficient to discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of the
debtor, and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court,
continue any legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt.

Additionally, the creditors or shareholders of a Jersey company can commence a winding-up of an insolvent

company, which is known as a “creditors’ winding up” pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the Companies (Jersey) Law
1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”). On a creditors’ winding up commenced by shareholders, a liquidator
is nominated by the shareholders. The creditors may nominate a different liquidator. If a different liquidator is nominated
by creditors, a director, member or creditor can apply to the court for an order that either the liquidator nominated by the
company be liquidator instead of or jointly with the liquidator nominated by the creditors or appointing a different
liquidator. On a creditors’ winding up commenced by application to court by a creditor, the court may appoint a
provisional liquidator any time after such application. At the hearing of the application, if a winding up order is made, the
court may appoint a person nominated by the creditor or selected by the court to be liquidator. If a liquidator is appointed
by the court, any creditor of the company may within seven days of the creditors’ meeting apply to court for someone
else to be appointed liquidator instead of the liquidator appointed by the court. The liquidator stands in the shoes of the
directors and administers the winding up, gathers assets, makes appropriate disposals of assets, settles claims and
distributes assets as appropriate. After the appointment of a provisional liquidator or the commencement of the winding
up (whether commenced by shareholders or court order), no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company
except with the leave of court. In a creditors’ winding up to be commenced by shareholders, the company must give
creditors not less than 14 days’ notice of the shareholders meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up and give notice
of a creditors meeting to be held immediately after the shareholders meeting. Notice of the creditors’ meeting must also
be given in the Jersey Gazette no less than 10 days before the day for which the meeting has been called. Except in
exceptional circumstances, a creditor who applies to wind up the company must give the company at least 48 hours’
notice that the application is being made. If the court orders a creditors’ winding up or appoints a provisional liquidator,
the liquidator must, within seven days of the liquidator’s appointment, give the company’s creditors notice calling a
creditors meeting to be held in Jersey 21 days after the date of such court order (or if that day is not a business day, the
next business day thereafter). After the commencement of the creditors’ winding up, a secured party may, however,
without the sanction of a liquidator and without an order of the court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have
under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the 2012 Security Law. If the proceeds of such enforcement are
insufficient to fully discharge the liabilities owed, that secured party cannot bring any action against the company without
the leave of the court. The corporate state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding up
procedure, when the company is dissolved. Under the Jersey Companies Law, a creditor of a company (subject to appeal)


-----

is bound by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of its
winding up if, among other things, three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to such arrangement.

**_Transactions at an Undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may, on

the application of the Jersey Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or
liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or security interest)
entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”) at an undervalue. There is a five-year look-back period
from the date of commencement of the winding up or declaration of désastre during which transactions are susceptible to
examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain
detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the
operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the company
or with an associate of the company.

**_Preference_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the court

may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or
liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or security interest)
given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period from the date of
commencement of the winding up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination
pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed
provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant
time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the
company.

**_Extortionate Credit Transactions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court may,

on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en désastre”) or
liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding up), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor company which is
or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding up or
declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant
time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Property_**

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of the

declaration of désastre and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months
following the commencement of a creditors’ winding up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous
property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated
outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or
perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the “rights, interests and liabilities of the company

in or in respect of the property disclaimed” but “does not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the
company from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.” A person sustaining loss or damage as a result
of a disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a
creditor in the désastre or creditors’ winding up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed
provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

**_Fraudulent Dispositions_**

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey customary

law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating creditors’ claims
may be set aside.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a company incorporated in Jersey is deemed to have capacity to grant security

governed by foreign law over property situated outside the Island of Jersey, however:


-----

      - to the extent that any fixed charge, floating charge or other security interest governed by non-Jersey law (a
“Foreign Law Security”) is expressed to apply as regards any Jersey situated intangible moveable
property, such Foreign Law Security should not be relied upon to create valid and enforceable security in
such Jersey situated intangible moveable property; and

      - to the extent that any Foreign Law Security is expressed to apply as regards Jersey situated immovable
property or Jersey situated tangible property, such Foreign Law Security would not be valid and enforceable
as regards such Jersey situated immovable property or Jersey situated tangible property.

**_Administrators, Receivers and Statutory and Non-statutory Requests for Assistance_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the

Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of
the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Courts of Jersey may not recognize the powers of an administrator, administrative
receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

However, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Jersey court may assist the courts of prescribed

countries and territories in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Jersey court thinks fit.
These prescribed jurisdictions include the United Kingdom. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the
UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in
Jersey.

If the request comes from a non-prescribed country, then common law and principles of comity will be

considered by the Royal Court by virtue of its inherent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are afoot in another
jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the
nature of the requesting country’s insolvency regime. If the requesting country adheres to principles of territoriality, as
opposed to universality, and, for instance, ring-fences assets for local creditors, full cooperation is highly unlikely. If,
however, the jurisdiction applies similar fundamental principles to those applied in Jersey, the Royal Court’s approach is
more likely to be similar to the position where prescribed countries are involved.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should not be assumed that the

UNCITRAL provisions will automatically be followed. That is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. It would
also be wrong to assume for European countries that the position will be in accordance with Recast EU Insolvency
Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions.
Accordingly, the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law and the automatic
test of COMI does not apply as a result.

**_Enforcement of Jersey Security Interests under the 2012 Security Law_**

Security over assets situated in Jersey is created in accordance with the provisions of Jersey law. The Notes will

be secured by Jersey law security interests over all of the shares of INEOS Jersey Limited held by IHL.

The 2012 Security Law provides that a secured party may enforce security over intangible movable assets by

way of sale or appropriation of the collateral or proceeds. In addition, a secured party may take certain ancillary actions
including any bespoke enforcement powers included in a security agreement to the extent not in conflict with the 2012
Security Law. More than one enforcement option can be taken, and taking one or more of the enforcement options
specified above does not preclude the exercise of a secured party’s other rights.

The power of enforcement under the 2012 Security Law is exercisable once an event of default has occurred and

written notice specifying the event of default has been served on the grantor by the secured party. If enforcement is by
way of sale or appropriation, the secured party must give the grantor 14 days’ prior written notice unless the grantor has
agreed in writing to waive its right to notice. Said waivers are common in the security agreement. The secured party is
also obliged to give at least 14 days’ prior written notice to (i) any person who has registered security interest in the
collateral 21 days before the sale or appropriation, and (ii) any person other than the grantor who has an interest in the
collateral unless, in either case, the secured party and such person have otherwise agreed in writing. There are other
exceptions from the obligation to give notice of sale.

On exercising the power of enforcement by appropriation or sale, the secured party must (i) take all

commercially reasonable steps to determine or, in the case of a sale, obtain the fair market value of the collateral, as at
the time of the relevant appropriation or sale; (ii) act in a commercially reasonable manner in relation to the appropriation
or sale; and (iii) also, in the case of a sale only, enter into any agreement for or in relation to the sale only on
commercially reasonable terms. The duty of the secured party is owed to the grantor and also to any other person to
whom the secured party was required to give notice of the appropriation or sale.


-----

If, in exercising its powers of enforcement under the 2012 Security Law, a secured party appropriates or sells

collateral, it must, within 14 days after the day on which the collateral is appropriated or sold, give to the grantor, to any
person with a registered subordinate security interest and to certain persons claiming an interest in the collateral a written
statement of account setting out certain information in relation to that appropriation or sale.

If a secured party has sold or appropriated the collateral and the net value or proceeds of the collateral exceeds

the amount of the secured debt, the secured party must (subject to any senior security interests) pay the amount of any
resulting surplus in the following order: (i) in due order of priority, to any person who has a registered subordinate
security interest in the collateral (where the registration remained effective immediately before the appropriation or sale);
(ii) to any other person (other than the grantor) who has given the secured party notice that that person claims an interest
in the collateral and in respect of which the secured party is satisfied that that person has a legally enforceable interest in
the collateral; and (iii) as to the balance (if any) to the grantor. Alternatively, the secured party may discharge its
aforementioned obligation with respect to any surplus by paying that amount into the Jersey courts, which may then only
be paid out based on an order of the court following an application by a person entitled to such surplus.

**Luxembourg**

**_Insolvency_**

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency proceedings)

may be opened against an entity having its COMI in Luxembourg or an establishment within the meaning of Recast EU
Insolvency Regulation:

      - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of its
creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the
Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost
its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied,
it may also open bankruptcy proceedings, ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor).
The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company,
except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the
secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets;

      - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the
company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order provisional suspension of payments,
including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors; and

      - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), which may be requested only by the company
(subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors themselves. The
court’s decision to admit a company to the composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on
enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition, your ability to receive payment on the relevant Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to

grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the relevant Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation
(liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against
companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial code
or of the laws governing commercial companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow
the rules of bankruptcy proceedings.

**_Preferential debts_**

Liability of a Luxembourg Guarantor in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the entity

following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt
incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under
Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others:

      - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue;

      - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise;

      - social security contributions; and

      - remuneration owed to employees.


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive. Assets in the form of shares, accounts or receivables

over which a security interest has been granted and perfected will in principle not be available for distribution to
unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized), and subject to application of the
relevant priority rule and liens and privileges arising mandatorily by law. In particular, pursuant to article 20 of the
Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements (the “Luxembourg Collateral
**Law”), all collateral arrangements, in respect of assets over which the Luxembourg security interests have been granted,**
as well as all enforcement events and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with
this law, are valid and enforceable against unsecured creditors, third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and
other similar persons notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings.

**_General limitations on enforcement resulting from insolvency proceedings_**

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The

ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of
controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final
decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a
reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the
creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect.
Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the
occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the relevant

Luxembourg company during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “suspect period” (periode suspecte), which is a
maximum of six months, as from the date on which the Commercial Court formally adjudicates a person bankrupt, and,
as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such
period preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start
of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceedings
(e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled management proceedings) under Luxembourg law. In particular:

      - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified transactions
(such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts which
have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other
means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange;
the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during
the suspect period (or the 10 days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested
by the insolvency receiver;

      - pursuant to article 21 (2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, notwithstanding the suspect period as referred
to in articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, where a financial collateral arrangement
has been entered into on the day of the commencement of domestic or foreign winding-up proceedings or
reorganization measures or similar proceedings, but after the Court decision ruling regarding the opening of
such proceedings or after such measure becomes effective, such arrangement is valid and binding against
third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker
proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had
been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it;

      - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as
other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the
court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of
the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; and

      - in the case of bankruptcy, article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Civil
Code (action paulienne) gives the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) the right to
challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to
defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of

contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency
were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose
to terminate certain contracts. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will
accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate.


-----

Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg company’s

business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes (as Luxembourg Guarantor).

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings

may be subject to Recast EU Insolvency Regulation.

**_Enforceability of financial collateral arrangements_**

According to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, with the exception of the provisions of the law of 8 January 2013

on the over-extension of debt, the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the Luxembourg Civil Code, of Book I, Title VIII
and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and national or foreign provisions governing reorganization
measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments are not applicable to financial collateral
arrangements and netting agreements and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance by
the parties of their obligations.

Pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, Luxembourg law governed financial collateral

arrangements, as well as the enforcement events, netting agreements and the valuation and enforcement measures agreed
upon by the parties in accordance with this law, remain valid and enforceable even if entered into during the hardening
period against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding
reorganization measures, winding up proceedings or any other similar national or foreign proceedings (save in the case of
fraud).

In accordance with article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the rules of Luxembourg insolvency

proceedings are inapplicable where the collateral provider of financial collateral arrangement or similar security interest
governed by a foreign law other than Luxembourg law, is established or resides in Luxembourg.

**_Limitations on Enforcement of guarantees_**

There is no published Luxembourg case law and only limited Luxembourg legal literature in connection with

enforcement of guarantees granted by a Luxembourg guarantor for a company of the group (whether downstream,
cross-stream or upstream guarantees).

It is generally admitted that the grant of a guarantee by a Luxembourg company for the obligations of another

group company shall be subject to the following conditions: (i) it must be within the corporate purpose of the guarantor
as set out in its articles of association; (ii) it shall correspond to a demonstrable and commensurate corporate benefit
received by the guarantor company; and (iii) the financial obligations assumed by the guarantor must not be
disproportionate to the financial capacity of the guarantor.

The question of corporate benefit is determined on a case-by-case basis.

For the purpose of condition (iii) above, it is standard market practice that cross-stream and upstream guarantees

granted by Luxembourg guarantors must be limited in their amount (as is the case pursuant to the Indenture), as opposed
to downstream guarantees.

According to the limited Luxembourg doctrine on this matter, in the event the above conditions are not met, the

directors of the company may be held liable and it is only in exceptional cases in which it is demonstrated that (i) the
beneficiary was aware of the ultra vires nature of the guarantee or (ii) that the guarantee was given with the intent to
defraud creditors of the guarantor or (iii) the guarantee qualifies as a misuse of corporate asset (abus de bien social) that a
court may void the guarantee itself.

In accordance with the principle fraus omnia corrumpit, a first demand guarantee would not be enforceable

under Luxembourg law if it is called upon in a manifestly abusive way by the beneficiary of the guarantee.

**_Security Interests Considerations_**

The Notes are secured, among other things, by several security interests governed by Luxembourg law.

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex
_situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the_
creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will
apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be
located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg
bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets


-----

located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically
located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be

governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The
Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank
account and receivables located in Luxembourg. Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security
interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements.

Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth the following enforcement remedies available upon the

occurrence of an enforcement event:

      - the direct appropriation, or appropriation by third parties, of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in
accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the market price, where the pledged
financial instruments are admitted to trading on a trading venue;

      - a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions
_commerciales normales), (ii) on a trading venue on which they are admitted to trading or (iii) by way of a_
public auction;

      - a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

      - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method

chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv) the possible need to involve third
parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be
substantially delayed.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be

enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or arrangements,
which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or administrators might not
be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes
subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of
the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the
Recast EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interest or arrangements
constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation
applies.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third

party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created
under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of
the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain
entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the enforcement of a pledge is permitted in case of an event of default

as agreed between the parties, including an event of default which would not be a default of payment when due (e.g.,
breach of covenants or representations and warranties).

**_Certain Preferences_**

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by

operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or
unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes in particular the
rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain
amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which
preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle
precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.


-----

**_Translation of Documents_**

The Luxembourg courts, or the official Luxembourg authority, may require that the Notes, the Security

Documents, the Indenture (and any other document in connection therewith), and any judgment obtained in a foreign
court, be translated into French or German.

**Norway**

**_Insolvency_**

Norwegian insolvency legislation is regulated by the Norwegian Bankruptcy Act of June 8, 1984 No. 58 (the

“Bankruptcy Act”), which sets out the various procedures to be followed both in case of court administered debt
negotiations and bankruptcy proceedings, and the Norwegian Creditors Recovery Act of June 8, 1984 No. 59 (the
“Recovery Act”) containing provisions on, among other things, the priority of claims.

Further, relevant rules are laid down in the Norwegian Temporary Act on Reorganization to Mitigate Economic

Hardship Resulting from COVID-19 (Rekonstruksjonsloven, the “Temporary Reorganization Act”). The financial
distress caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020 prompted the Norwegian government to enact the
Temporary Reorganization Act which, according to the Temporary Reorganization Act, will remain in place until July 1,
2023, and is expected to be replaced with a permanent new reorganization act based on the same principles as the
Temporary Reorganization Act.

The key features of the Norwegian bankruptcy proceedings are (i) the seizure and subsequent disposal of the

debtor’s assets, (ii) the assessment and ranking of claims, (iii) the testing and revocation of transactions (including
security over existing claims) made prior to the bankruptcy proceedings being initiated, (iv) the handling of the debtor’s
contractual relationships and (v) the distribution of funds (if any) in accordance with the priority rules. If the business
operations of the bankrupt company are continued, they are in practice continued at the risk of, and only to the extent
guaranteed by, the creditors.

Bankruptcy proceedings may be opened provided that the debtor is insolvent. Both the debtor and the creditors

(holding or pretending to hold a claim) can petition for bankruptcy.

There are two requirements for a debtor to be deemed to be insolvent. The debtor must (i) be unable to service

its debt as it becomes due (the “cash flow test”), and (ii) be in “deficit” (the company’s debts must exceed the sum of its
assets and revenues) (the “balance sheet test”).

During bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor’s assets are controlled by the court appointed liquidator (generally a

lawyer), on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The main task of the liquidator is to turn all the debtor’s assets into cash in
the manner assumed to be most profitable for the bankruptcy estate (the creditors), and then to distribute the available
cash to the rightful creditors.

All the debtor’s assets will in practice be seized by the bankruptcy estate, and the debtor may not dispose of the

seized assets in any way while the bankruptcy proceedings are ongoing. The bankruptcy estate may also seize assets held
by third parties, if these assets are acquired from the debtor in an unlawful manner, if the acquisition lacks legal
protection, or if the transaction can be reversed according to the Recovery Act. The bankruptcy estate is a separate legal
entity, which is authorized to exercise all ownership interests/rights with respect to the seized assets, including but not
limited to the realization of assets.

Secured creditors are, in principle, not deemed to be part of the bankruptcy proceedings to the extent the value

of the security is sufficient to cover the underlying obligations of the debtor. The secured creditors may, in principle,
realize the security and cover their claims, however, keeping in mind that the realization of a number of categories of
security the first six months after the opening of a bankruptcy will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate (the
same principles apply to official debt negotiations). The bankruptcy estate may, subject to certain conditions being
fulfilled, also decide to realize the security and divide the proceeds between the secured creditors and others holding legal
rights in the assets. In particular, it should be noted that a three-month hardening period applies to security if such
security is provided for debt already existing when the security was agreed, or if legal perfection for the security is not
achieved without undue delay after the secured debt was incurred.

Any undersecured amount (any amount exceeding the value of the secured assets) will be deemed as an ordinary

(unsecured) trade claim.

In a Norwegian bankruptcy, the creditors will be paid according to the following priority:


-----

      - Secured claims (valid and perfected security covered up to the value of the secured asset—either after the
realization by the secured creditor itself or after realization undertaken by the bankruptcy estate).

      - Super priority claims (claims which arise during the bankruptcy proceedings, liquidator’s costs, obligations
of the bankruptcy estate).

      - Salary claims (within certain limitations).

      - Tax claims (such as withholding tax and value-added tax within certain limitations).

      - Ordinary unsecured claims (all other claims unless subordinated, including unsecured debt, trade creditors
and indemnity claims).

      - Subordinated claims (including interest incurred after the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, claims
subordinated by agreement, liquidated damages and penalty claims).

Pursuant to the Recovery Act, the bankruptcy estate may be entitled to set aside or reverse transactions carried

out in the three- up to 12-month period (and in respect of transactions in favor of related parties up to two years) before
the opening of the bankruptcy, such as extraordinary payments of certain creditors, security established for old debt and
transaction at under-value. The bankruptcy estate may also, under certain circumstances, be entitled to set aside or
reverse transactions made in bad faith or negligently which in an improper manner increase the debtor’s debt, favor one
creditor at the expense of others or deprive the debtor of assets which may otherwise have served to cover the creditors’
claims, in which case the time limit for challenges by the estate is increased to 10 years.

It should also be noted that the bankruptcy estate has a statutory first lien of up to five percent of the respective

asset’s estimated value or sales value over assets mortgaged/pledged by the debtor or mortgaged/pledged by a third party
for the debtor’s indebtedness (limited however, to the Norwegian court fee multiplied by 700 for assets registered in an
asset register (realregister)). Such statutory lien is not applicable to financial security pursuant to the Norwegian
Financial Security Act of March 26, 2004 No. 17 (cash deposits and financial instruments), cf., the Norwegian Liens Act
of February 8, 1980 No. 2 section 6-4 (9).

**_Limitations on guarantees and securities provided by Guarantors incorporated in Norway_**

Section 8-7 of the Norwegian Private Limited Companies Act of June 13, 1997 No. 44 and the Norwegian

Public Limited Companies Act of June 13, 1997 No. 45 (together, the “Norwegian Companies Act”) restricts a
Norwegian private and public limited liability company from granting credit to, guaranteeing or providing security for
the obligations of, its shareholders (or any related party) beyond its distributable reserves (free equity) and then, further
provided that satisfactory security for repayment/recovery has been established in favor of the relevant Norwegian
limited liability company.

The above restriction does not, however, apply to credit or security/guarantee for the obligations of a parent

company or another company within the same “group.” This exemption must be read in conjunction with the group
definition in Section 1-3 of the Norwegian Companies Act which, broadly speaking, includes Norwegian limited liability
companies. A Norwegian limited liability company may also grant credit or provide security and guarantees for the
obligations of a foreign parent or sister company, provided that such credit, security or guarantee financially benefits the
group, is in the interest of the grantor and the purpose of the transaction is not to benefit the beneficial owners of the
group, for example by financing distributions to the owners.

In addition to the restrictions with regard to, among others, upstream and cross-stream guarantees and security

as outlined above, Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Act restricts the ability of a Norwegian private or public
limited liability company to provide financial assistance (including to put funds at disposal, grant loans or provide
security or guarantees) in connection with the acquisition of its shares or the shares in the parent company (and any
intermediate parent company). The restrictions against financial assistance apply irrespective of whether the company
whose shares are acquired is a Norwegian or a foreign company. In order for a guarantee, loan or security provided by a
Norwegian Guarantor in favor of a purchaser of shares in the Norwegian Guarantor or its parent company to be valid and
binding, the financial exposure of the Norwegian Guarantor must not exceed the amounts that the Norwegian Guarantor
has available for distribution of dividends to its shareholders, and the financial assistance must be granted on ordinary,
commercial terms. The limitation of financial assistance to amounts that the Norwegian Guarantor has available for
distribution of dividends does not apply if the acquirer of the shares is based in the EEA and the acquirer is, or will
following the acquisition, form part of the same group of companies as the Norwegian Guarantor. In addition,
Section 8-10 of the Norwegian Companies Act requires that the credit worthiness of the purchaser is evaluated by the
board of directors and that the board of directors grant a declaration to the effect that it will be in the interest of the
company to grant the financial assistance and that the company will have sufficient equity and liquidity for doing so and


-----

also give an account for the background and terms of such financial assistance. The financial assistance must thereafter
be approved by at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the share capital represented at the general meeting of the
Norwegian Guarantor and in accordance with a special procedure where the information is filed with the Norwegian
Register of Business Enterprises (No.: Foretaksregisteret) before the financial assistance can be granted. The restrictions
apply not only to the granting of loans, guarantees and securities, but also to asset distributions and other transfers which
are not deemed lawful distributions under the Norwegian Companies Act. The assistance is restricted if made “in
connection with” the acquisition of the shares, which may also cover financial assistance after completion of the
acquisition, for instance, by way of a refinancing of acquisition debt.

A loan, guarantee or security interest infringing the limitations set out in Section 8-7 and Section 8-10 of the

Norwegian Companies Act is void and any funds paid out pursuant to such guarantee or security interest will have to be
repaid. In addition, loans, securities and guarantees of Guarantors incorporated in Norway may be deemed void for
failing to comply with the provisions in Chapter 3 of the Norwegian Companies Act regulating transactions between the
company and its shareholders and transactions within the “group.”

The principle of corporate benefit also exists in Norway and may in some situations impose a restriction on a

Norwegian company’s ability to offer credits or a guarantee and provide security to shareholders (or close associates of
the shareholders) in addition to the restrictions on financial assistance and upstream/cross-stream guarantees, loans and
security described above.

Accordingly, any guarantees and security for the Notes provided by Guarantors incorporated in Norway may be

void under Norwegian law as infringing one or more of the above limitations.

The limitations set forth in these sections will apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by a Guarantor

incorporated in Norway under the Collateral and to any guarantee, indemnity and similar obligations resulting in a
payment obligation and payment pursuant to the Collateral made by a Guarantor incorporated in Norway.

**_Foreclosure of Security Interest_**

Enforcement of the Norwegian law share pledges will be subject to the mandatory provisions of the Norwegian

Financial Securities Act of March 26, 2004 No. 17, which stipulates that enforcement must be implemented on
commercially reasonable terms. Enforcement of the other Norwegian law security in Norway will be subject to the
mandatory provisions of the Norwegian Enforcement Act of June 26, 1992 No. 86.

Under the Norwegian Companies Act, Section 5-2, a shareholder may at any time revoke a power of attorney to

exercise voting rights. Accordingly, provisions in the Share Pledges giving the holder of the security power of attorney to
vote for the relevant shares may therefore be rendered ineffective against the relevant company whose shares are pledged
in the event the pledgor of the relevant shares were to revoke the power of attorney while he remains the registered owner
of the shares.

A pledge in future shares is only to be read as an obligation to pledge future shares and not a pledge in itself,

consequently a share declaration by the pledgor must be issued and notified to the issuer of the shares, upon issuance of
the shares, in order to receive a perfected security interest.

Only creditors of a claim may have active judicial standing in a Norwegian court; therefore, a security agent

may seek enforcement of a claim but such claim may have to be supported by the actual creditors of such claim. A
security agent has standing to be sued in Norway and it is believed that a security agent may enforce any security being
subject to the Norwegian Financial Securities Act of March 26, 2004 No. 17 implementing the EU Financial Collateral
Directive.

**Scotland**

**_The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union_**

While the United Kingdom was a member state of the EU, jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings and

insolvency processes opened in the United Kingdom were subject to both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation.
Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, and the expiry of the subsequent
Transition Period on December 31, 2020, in accordance with the EUWA, EU law as directly applicable in the United
Kingdom at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject
to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended)
effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the United Kingdom, including
the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation, and domestic insolvency laws. Additional regulations were implemented in


-----

Scotland (The Insolvency (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations (SI 2019/94)) to effect necessary amendments
to Scottish specific legislation.

**_Insolvency_**

Some of the security interests are being granted under the laws of Scotland by non-Scottish entities (each, a

“Scottish Security Grantor”). Any insolvency proceedings by or against a Scottish Security Grantor may be based on
Scottish insolvency laws if the relevant jurisdiction can be established, however, the country of incorporation of the
relevant non-Scottish entity or its COMI may affect which country’s insolvency laws apply.

Although the scope of the Scottish courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available

in Scotland, Scottish courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which
is incorporated in Scotland, any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or any company which has its
COMI in an EU Member State (other than Denmark). In certain cases it may also be necessary for foreign incorporated
entities to meet a number of other threshold requirements such as demonstrating a sufficient connection with the Scottish
jurisdiction. While this allows Scottish courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain
insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings may significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of
subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions.

To the extent that a Scottish Security Grantor has its COMI in an EU Member State, insolvency proceedings

could, pursuant to the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU
Member State and be subject to the laws of that EU Member State.

**_Receivership_**

Pursuant to Section 51(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986, it is competent, subject to the comments below regarding

administrative receivership, for a holder of a floating charge to appoint a receiver over the property which is subject to
the floating charge, provided that either the Court of Session has jurisdiction to wind up the grantor of the floating
charge, or, where the Court of Session does not have jurisdiction to wind up the grantor of the floating charge, a court of
an EU Member State has jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings under the Recast EU Insolvency Regulation as that
Regulation has effect in the European Union.

In terms of the Insolvency Act 1986, the Court of Session has jurisdiction to wind up any company registered in

Scotland. The Insolvency Act 1986 also confers a broad discretion to order the winding up of an unregistered company
(which includes any association or company, with the exception of a company registered under the Companies Act 2006
in any part of the United Kingdom). Such discretion may be exercised in relation to a Scottish Security Grantor if the
following three core requirements are met: (i) the Scottish Security Grantor has a sufficient connection with Scotland;
(ii) there is a reasonable possibility of benefit to the party or parties applying for the winding up of the Scottish Security
Grantor; and (iii) one or more persons interested in the distribution of the Scottish Security Grantor’s assets is a person
over whom the court can exercise jurisdiction.

Whether a court of an EU Member State has jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings will depend on the

location of the company’s COMI and whether this is found to be in the relevant EU Member State or in another EU
Member State provided that the company has an establishment in the relevant EU Member State. There are a number of
factors that are taken into account to ascertain the COMI. The COMI should correspond to the place where the company
conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties. The place of
the registered office of the company is presumed to be the COMI in the absence of proof to the contrary, provided that
the registered office has not been moved to another EU Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for
the opening of insolvency proceedings. The point at which this issue falls to be determined is the time when the
application to open insolvency proceedings is filed.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

There is a number of ways in which fixed charge security has an advantage over floating charge security:

(a) provided that the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral
arrangement, an administrator appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such
cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the administrator’s
remuneration and the costs of continuing to operate the charging company’s business) while in administration in priority
to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have
priority as against the floating charge over the same charged assets (provided the fixed charge holder has no notice of any
restrictions); (c) provided that the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial
collateral arrangement, costs and expenses (including the liquidator’s remuneration) properly incurred in a winding up
are payable out of the company’s assets (including the assets that are the subject of the floating charge) in priority to the


-----

claims of the floating charge holder either where agreed or where the costs and expenses are related to the realization of
the floating charge assets; (d) until the floating charge security crystallizes (which does not occur automatically on the
appointment of an administrator in Scotland), a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge
security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging
company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge; (e) there are particular challenge
risks in relation to floating charge security (see “—Grant of Floating Charge”); (f) where the floating charge is not
created or does not otherwise arise under a security financial collateral arrangement, floating charge security is subject to
the claims of certain preferential creditors (such as certain unpaid pension contributions, salaries owed to employees
(subject to a cap per employee), holiday pay owed to employees and VAT and certain other tax debts due to HMRC) and
to ring-fencing for unsecured creditors (see “—Administration and Floating Charges”); and (g) an administrator may
dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or
court approval, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal
of the assets subject to the floating charge. With prior approval of the court, an administrator may deal with property
subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that
the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal of the property in question, together with any additional
money required to be added to the net proceeds so as to produce the amount determined by the court as the net amount
which would be realised on a sale of the property at market value, towards discharging the obligations of the company to
the charge holder. These provisions do not apply to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a financial
collateral arrangement.

In Scotland, forms of security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scottish law does not

recognize the English law concept of “equity”, there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the intention of the
parties with respect to the creation of security interests. Further, Scottish law does not differentiate between legal and
equitable ownership of property which further impacts the requirements to create security. If the strict legal requirements
under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the subject notwithstanding the intention of the parties.

In respect of movable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession (which may

take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid fixed security interest. Scots law does not differentiate
between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create a security interest over shares in
companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee) must be registered as the shareholder.
Furthermore, as there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law equitable assignment, a Scottish interest in incorporeal
property will only be created when the assignation is intimated to the relevant parties.

Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a standard security (which

is similar to the English law legal mortgage over an interest of land) and is governed by statute. The process of enforcing
a fixed charge over land is very different to that in England and there is no ability to appoint a fixed charge receiver over
property.

**_Administration and Floating Charges_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, an administrator may be appointed in respect of (i) a company incorporated in

England and Wales or Scotland (however, in respect of a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales,
the administrator would likely be appointed in England and Wales); (ii) a company incorporated in an EEA state; (iii) a
company not incorporated in an EEA state but with its COMI in the United Kingdom or an EU Member State (other than
Denmark); (iv) a company (wherever incorporated) having its COMI in the United Kingdom; or (v) a company
(wherever incorporated) with its COMI in an EU Member State and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom. In
addition to the court appointment of an administrator, an administrator can be appointed out of court by the company, its
directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge, which was granted by the company and which has become
enforceable, and different procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. During the administration, or after
a notice of intention to appoint an administrator has been lodged, amongst other restrictions, in general no proceedings or
other legal process may be commenced or continued against the debtor, or security enforced over the company’s
property, except with leave of the court or the consent of the administrator. Certain creditors of a company in
administration may be able to realize their security over that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory
moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to a “security financial collateral
agreement” (generally, cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments)
under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003. If a Scottish Security Grantor were to enter
administration, it is possible that the security granted by it or the guarantee granted by it may not be enforced while it is
in administration. In addition, other than in limited circumstances, no administrative receiver can be appointed by a
secured creditor in preference to an administrator, and any already appointed must resign if requested to do so by the
administrator. Where the company is already in administration no other receiver may be appointed.

In order to empower the Security Trustee to appoint an administrative receiver or an administrator out of court

to the company, the floating charge granted by the relevant Scottish Security Grantor must constitute a “qualifying


-----

floating charge” for purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the case of the ability to appoint an administrator, the
Security Trustee must be the holder of a qualifying floating charge for purposes of Scottish insolvency law and, in the
case of the ability to appoint an administrative receiver, the qualifying floating charge must, unless the security document
predates September 15, 2003, fall within one of the exceptions to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative
receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which
(a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator
of the company; (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver; or (d) purports to empower the
holder of a floating charge in Scotland to appoint a receiver who on appointment would be an administrative receiver
(although this is only permitted under limited circumstances). The Security Trustee will be the holder of a qualifying
floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with the fixed charge security interests granted to
it, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the Scottish Security Grantor’s property and at least one such security
interest is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an
administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the Insolvency Act 1986,
as amended), which will apply if the issue of the notes creates a debt of at least £50,000,000 for the relevant company
during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital markets investment” (which is
defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). An administrator, receiver
or liquidator of the company will be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of
floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors. Under current law, this applies to 50% of the first £10,000
of net floating charge realizations and 20% of the remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £600,000,
or £800,000 in relation to floating charges which come into existence on or after April 6, 2020. Whether the assets that
are subject to the floating charges and other security will constitute substantially the whole of the Scottish Security
Grantor’s assets at the time that the floating charges are enforced will be a question of fact at that time.

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by

the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if
the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which
the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge on certain grounds. If an administrator is appointed, any
administrative receiver will vacate office. Further, upon the appointment of an administrator, any receiver of part of the
company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a
charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (as defined in the Financial Collateral
Regulations).

In addition, under Scottish insolvency law, any debt payable in a currency other than pounds sterling (such as

euro or U.S. dollars in the case of the notes) may, in certain circumstances, be claimed in a currency other than pounds
sterling. However, where creditors are asked to submit statements of claim, that claim will then be converted into pounds
sterling at the rate of exchange determined by the liquidator or administrator by reference to the exchange rates
prevailing in the London market at close of business on the date when the company went into liqudation or
administration. Accordingly, in the event that the Scottish Security Grantor goes into liquidation or administration,
holders of the notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date that the Scottish Security Grantor went into
liquidation or administration and the date of receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the notes may become
entitled. Any such holder of the Notes would not be entitled to make a claim for any losses suffered by them as a result of
a decrease in value of pounds sterling between the “relevant date” and the date of any distribution.

There are circumstances under Scottish insolvency law in which the granting by a company of security and

guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed into administration or
liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security, although common law challenges can be
brought beyond the specified period. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator is appointed to a Scottish
Security Grantor, he may challenge the validity of the guarantee or security given by such company. Further, the
insolvency practitioner may elect to assign such a right of action (including the proceeds therefrom) to another party who
would then be entitled to pursue it.

The following potential grounds for challenge may apply to guarantees and security interests in Scotland.

**_Gratuitous Alienations_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, a security interest or a guarantee granted by the company can be challenged on

the grounds that the creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a gratuitous alienation. Such a challenge
can be brought by the administrator if the company enters administration, or if the winding-up of the company has
commenced, either by the liquidator or by any creditor who is a creditor of the company by virtue of a debt incurred on
or before the date of commencement of the winding-up. The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into
liquidation or administration proceedings within a period of two years from the date the company grants the security
interest or the guarantee (or the date on which such security interest or guarantee becomes completely effectual) to a
party which is not an “associate” (as defined by reference to the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 2016) of the company, or


-----

within a period of five years in the case of an “associate” of the company. A transaction might be subject to being set
aside as a gratuitous alienation if the company makes a gift to a person (except in certain specified circumstances), if the
company receives no consideration or if the company receives inadequate consideration in respect of the transaction.
However, a court generally will not intervene if the person seeking to uphold the alienation establishes (i) that
immediately or at any other time after the alienation the company’s assets were greater than its liabilities, (ii) the
alienation was made for adequate consideration, or (iii) the alienation was a birthday, Christmas or other conventional
gift, or (iv) the gift was made for a charitable purpose to a person not an associate of the company, which having regard
to all circumstances it was reasonable for the company to make. If the court determines that the transaction was a
gratuitous alienation the court can grant a reduction or restoration of the property or assets or such other redress as may
be appropriate (although there is protection for a third party who acquires in good faith and for value any right or interest
from or through the transferee in the alienation).

A transaction made at a time when a company is insolvent may also constitute a gratuitous alienation at

common law. In these circumstances, no time limits apply in relation to challenging it. A gratuitous alienation may
constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading, or a breach of duty, and lead to action being raised against directors
personally.

**_Unfair Preferences_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, a security interest or a guarantee can be challenged on the grounds that the

security interest or such guarantee constituted an unfair preference in so far as it has the effect of creating a preference in
favor of a creditor to the prejudice of the general body of creditors. The transaction can be challenged by the
administrator if the company enters administration, or if the winding-up of the company has commenced, either by the
liquidator or any creditor of the company who is a creditor by virtue of a debt incurred on or before the date of
commencement of the winding-up. The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within a period of six months from the date the company grants the security interest or the
guarantee (or the date on which such security interest of guarantee becomes completely effectual). A transaction may
constitute an unfair preference if it has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or Guarantor for any of
the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been
in had that transaction not been entered into to the prejudice of the general body of creditors. If the court determines that
the transaction was an unfair preference, the court shall grant a reduction or restoration of the property to the company's
assets or such other redress as may be appropriate (although there is protection for a third party who acquires in good
faith and for value any right or interest from or through the creditor in whose favor the preference was created). The
following will not constitute unfair preferences:

      - transactions in the ordinary course of trade or business;

      - payment in cash for a debt that, when paid, has become payable, unless the transaction was collusive
with the purpose of prejudicing the general body of creditors;

      - transactions where the parties take on reciprocal obligations, unless the transaction was collusive; and

      - the granting of a mandate by a company authorising a person to pay over funds in compliance with a
court decree in certain prescribed circumstances.

A transaction may also constitute a fraudulent preference at common law (a fraudulent preference is the

common law equivalent of the statutory unfair preference). No time limits apply to a common law challenge. An unfair
preference may also constitute wrongful (or indeed fraudulent) trading or a breach of duty and lead to actions being
raised against directors personally.

**_Grant of Floating Charges_**

Under Scottish insolvency law, a floating charge granted by a company is invalid except to the extent of the

aggregate value of (i) the consideration for the creation of the floating charge consisting of money paid or goods or
services supplied to the company at the time of the creation of the floating charge, (ii) the value of the consideration
consisting of the discharge or reduction of any debt of the company at the same time as or after the creation of the
floating charge and (iii) the amount of any interest payable on these sums, if the company enters into liquidation or
administration proceedings within the relevant time period. The relevant time period is a period of one year (if the
beneficiary is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person) from the date the company
grants the floating charge. However, if the beneficiary is not a connected person, no amount of the floating charge will be
invalid unless the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (as defined by section 123 of the Insolvency Act
1986) or becomes unable to pay its debts as a consequence of granting the floating charge. An administrator or liquidator
(as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law.


-----

Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of
the foregoing amounts. However, this provision does not apply to any charge created or otherwise arising under a
“security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**Singapore**

The main legislation applicable to corporate insolvencies and reorganizations in Singapore, at the date of this

offering memorandum, is the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 of Singapore (the “IRD Act”) which
came into force on 30 July 2020. With the coming into force of the IRD Act, the provisions in the Companies Act 1967
of Singapore pertaining to corporate insolvency and restructuring were repealed.

**_Difference in Insolvency Law_**

One of the Guarantors is incorporated under the laws of Singapore (the “Singapore Guarantor”). Any

insolvency proceedings applicable to the Singapore Guarantor will be likely to be governed by Singapore insolvency
laws. Singapore insolvency laws differ from the insolvency laws of the United States and may make it more difficult for
holders of the Notes to recover the amount in respect of the Singapore Guarantor’s guarantee of the Notes and/or the
Collateral securing the same than they would have recovered in a liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding in the United
States.

**_Priority of Secured Creditors_**

Singapore insolvency laws generally recognize the priority of secured creditors over unsecured creditors. The

lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loans have security interests on certain of the assets of the Singapore Guarantor.

**_Security over Book Debts_**

Where security is taken over the book debt of a Singapore company by way of an assignment, the Civil Law Act

1909 of Singapore prescribes that a statutory assignment must be by way of an absolute assignment in writing under hand
of the assignor, not purporting to be by way of charge only, and express notice in writing thereof must be given to the
debtor, trustee or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive or claim such book debt.
Where such notice is not given, the assignment is only effective as an equitable assignment and a subsequent assignee of
the book debt who gives notice might have priority.

**_Fixed and Floating Charges_**

Fixed charges are superior to floating charges in a number of aspects. Until a floating charge crystallizes, a

company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to a floating charge in the ordinary course of business, meaning
that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the chargor company so as to give a third party good title to the assets
free of the floating charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the
floating charge. In addition, a floating charge created within one year (or, in the case of a floating charge created in favor
of a person who is connected (as defined in the IRD Act) with the chargor company, two years) of the commencement of
judicial management or winding up of the chargor company is invalid except to the extent set out in the IRD Act. Where
the assets of the chargor company are insufficient to pay certain preferential debts (these include winding up costs, wages
and salaries and retrenchment benefits), those preferential debts would have priority over debts secured by a floating
charge.

Amounts received in a winding-up or receivership from the realization of assets subject to a floating charge

must first be used to pay the holders of any fixed charge over such assets and then certain preferential creditors if
applicable (explained above) before any distribution is made to the holders of a floating charge.

It is open to a court to find that assignments and charges described as fixed charges constitute floating charges

rather than fixed charges, the description given to them as fixed charges not being determinative. One of the three
characteristics of a floating charge is the ability of the chargor company to carry on business in the ordinary course so far
as concerns the particular class of assets in question until some further step is taken by or on behalf of the chargee. Where
the chargor company, without the consent of the chargee, is free to deal with the assets or the proceeds of such assets that
form the subject matter of the charge, the court would be likely to hold that the charge in question constitutes a floating
charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. In addition, to the extent that any of the assets secured
by the Collateral are not specifically identified, an insolvency official may hold that such assets, which are expressed to
be subject to a fixed charge, may in fact be subject to a floating charge.


-----

**_Preferential Creditors_**

Under the IRD Act, in a winding-up of a Singapore company preferential debts are required to be paid in

priority to all other debts other than those secured by a fixed charge. Certain preferential debts therefore have priority
over debts secured by a floating charge (i.e., those listed in paragraphs (a) to (c) and (e) to (f) below) if the assets of the
chargor company are insufficient to satisfy such preferential debts. The preferential debts covered by the relevant
sections of the IRD Act are described briefly below:
(a) costs and expenses of the winding up;

(b) employees’ wages and salaries, including gratuity or other sum of money due and owing to an
employee on his retirement or on termination of his services pursuant to a collective agreement or an
award;

(c) retrenchment benefits or ex gratia payments under employment contracts;

(d) work injury compensation under the Work Injury Compensation Act 2019 of Singapore;

(e) certain amounts due under employee’s superannuation or provident funds or under any scheme of
superannuation which is an approved scheme under the Income Tax Act 1947 of Singapore;

(f) other remuneration payable to employees such as vacation leave and death benefits; and

(g) taxes assessed and goods and services tax.

Under the IRD Act, in a winding-up of a Singapore company, certain claims (if they exist) also rank ahead of a fixed
charge, including (without limitation) claims of workmen or employees with salaries of up to the amounts set out in the
Employment Act 1968 of Singapore.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The grant of a guarantee or collateral by a Singapore company for the obligations of another group company

must be for the corporate benefit of the granting company. The question of corporate benefit is determined on a
case-by-case basis and at the time when such guarantee or collateral is provided considering the totality of the
circumstances at that point in time.

Under Singapore law, if there is no corporate benefit justifiable for a Singapore company to provide guarantee

or security interest securing another group company’s obligations, such provision of guarantee or security interest can
raise a breach of fiduciary duty issue for the directors of such Singapore company. In such situation, the directors could
be sued by the Singapore company for damages suffered.

**_Transactions at Undervalue or Unfair Preference_**

Under the IRD Act, if a Singapore company goes into liquidation or judicial management, and has entered into

certain transactions at an undervalue within a period of three years before commencement of winding up or judicial
management, or has entered into a transaction by way of unfair preference within a period of one year (a two-year period
applies in the case of a transaction with a person who is connected with the company (as defined in the IRD Act)) before
the commencement of winding up or judicial management, those transactions may be liable to be made void or voidable.

**_Disclaimer of Onerous Contracts_**

The IRD Act provides that a liquidator or judicial manager may, by giving notice to the creditors and the

Official Receiver, disclaim, save in certain circumstances, any unprofitable contract, or any other property of the
company which is unsaleable, is not readily saleable, or may give rise to a liability of the company to pay money or
perform any other onerous act (“Onerous Property”). The Singapore court may make certain orders where a liquidator
or judicial manager has disclaimed Onerous Property, such as setting aside the disclaimer or make such order as the court
thinks just where the injury caused by the disclaimer outweighs any advantage likely to be gained by the liquidator or
judicial manager.

**_Certain Contractual Rights Limited_**

The IRD Act limits the exercise of certain contractual rights, such as terminating an agreement, claiming an

accelerated payment or forfeiture of term under any agreement (including a security agreement) with a Singapore


-----

company, by reason only that certain restructuring proceedings in respect of the company have commenced or that the
company is insolvent.

**_Enforcement Process_**

_Receivership_

Receivership arises principally by way of enforcement of the right of the holders of security under mortgage or

charges, as set out in the security document. The receiver is, in effect, an agent of the chargor company. Its rights and
obligations are usually set out in the security document itself.

The IRD Act expressly provides that a receiver is personally liable on any contract he or she entered into in the

performance of his or her functions (except insofar as the contract otherwise provides) and, to the extent of any
qualifying liability, on any contract of employment adopted by him or her in the performance of those functions. A
receiver is however entitled to an indemnity out of the property of the company or corporation.

_Appointment_

Receivers can be appointed on the basis of the powers set out in the security document. A person appointed on

the basis of a fixed charge over specific assets will act as receiver in respect of those assets. However, mortgages
containing a floating charge over all of the assets and undertaking typically provide for enforcement by means of the
appointment of a receiver having full powers as a receiver and manager over all of the secured assets (i.e., all of the
assets and undertaking of a chargor company), including the power of sale of the assets.

**Switzerland**

**_Limitations on guarantees and securities provided by Guarantors incorporated in Switzerland_**

Swiss rules regarding capital maintenance, including but not limited to Articles 671(1) to (4), 675(2) and 680(2)

of the Swiss Code of Obligations, prohibit the direct or indirect repayment of a Swiss stock corporation’s share capital
and legal reserves to its shareholders and restrict the distribution of a Swiss stock corporation’s accrued earnings to its
shareholders. guarantees, share pledges, assignments for security purposes and any other collateral granted by a Swiss
stock corporation in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company as well as any
other undertaking contained in any agreement having the same or a similar effect, such as, but not limited to, the waiver
of set off or subrogation rights or the subordination of intra-group claims may be considered as an indirect distribution of
assets which are subject to the limitation provided by Swiss law to protect the share capital and legal reserves of Swiss
stock corporation. Similar rules apply in case the guarantee or collateral is granted by a Swiss limited liability company
(GmbH). Therefore, it is standard market practice for indenture agreements, credit agreements, guarantees and security
documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to Swiss subsidiaries. Pursuant to such limitation
language, the enforcement of the guarantee and collateral granted by each of the Swiss Guarantors will be limited
reflecting the requirement that payments under the guarantee or, as the case may be, the use of proceeds from the
enforcement of collateral may not cause the Swiss Guarantors to incur a liability which would exceed its freely
distributable equity at the time of the enforcement of the guarantee or, as the case may be, any collateral. Accordingly,
the documentation in relation to the guarantees, to the extent they concern the Swiss Guarantors, contains such limitation
language and such guarantees and related security interests are limited in the manner described.

**_Insolvency_**

In the event of a Swiss entity’s insolvency, the respective insolvency proceedings would be governed by Swiss

law as a result of such Swiss entity’s offices being registered in the competent commercial register in Switzerland. In
addition, Swiss debt enforcement and insolvency laws may be applicable in case of an enforcement of security interests
over assets of a foreign entity located in Switzerland. The enforcement of claims and questions relating to insolvency and
bankruptcy in general are dealt with by the Swiss Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy. Under these rules,
claims that are pursued against a Swiss entity can lead to the opening of bankruptcy (Konkurs) and, hence, a general
liquidation of all assets, even if located outside Switzerland, and liabilities of the debtor. However, with regard to assets
located outside Switzerland, a Swiss bankruptcy decree is enforceable only if it is recognized at the place where such
assets are located. Creditors secured by a pledge must generally initiate enforcement proceedings pursuant to the Swiss
Federal Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy except in the event that (i) the parties have agreed on a private
liquidation; or (ii) the security provider has been adjudicated bankrupt. If the security provider has been adjudicated
bankrupt, secured creditors participate in the bankruptcy proceedings with the other creditors and a private liquidation is
no longer permitted. Certain particular rules apply to security interests created over intermediated securities pursuant to
the Swiss Federal Intermediated Securities Act.


-----

As a rule, the opening of bankruptcy by the competent court needs to be preceded by a prior debt enforcement

procedure which involves, inter alia, the issuance of a payment summons by local debt enforcement authorities
(Betreibungsamt). However, the competent court may also declare a debtor bankrupt without such prior proceedings if
the following requirements are met: (i) at the request of the debtor, if the debtor’s board of directors or the auditors of the
company (in case of failure of the board of directors) declare that the debtor is overindebted (überschuldet) within the
meaning of art. 725 (2) of the Swiss Code of Obligations (or the corresponding provision of the Swiss Code of
Obligations in case of a limited liability company (GmbH)) or if it declares to be insolvent (zahlungsunfähig), and (ii) at
the request of a creditor, if the debtor commits certain acts to the detriment of its creditors or ceases to make payments
(Zahlungseinstellung) or if certain events happen during composition proceedings. The bankruptcy proceedings are
carried out and the bankrupt estate is managed by the receiver in bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung).

All assets at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy and all assets acquired or received subsequently form the

bankrupt estate which, after deduction of costs and certain other expenses, is used to satisfy the creditors. Assets of the
bankrupt estate over which a pledge was created in favor of a creditor before the declaration of bankruptcy are included
in the bankrupt estate. The pledgee is under an obligation to remit the pledged assets to the bankrupt estate. The assets are
liquidated by the receiver in bankruptcy in the same manner as the other assets of the bankrupt estate, but the creditor
secured by the pledge retains its privilege to be satisfied from the proceeds of the liquidation of the assets pledged to it
with priority over the unsecured creditors. Final distribution of non-secured claims is based on a ranking of creditors in
three classes. The first and the second class, which are privileged, comprise claims under employment contracts, accident
insurance, pension plans, VAT and family law. Certain privileges can also be claimed by the government and its
subdivisions based on specific provisions of Federal law. All other creditors are treated equally in the third class. A
secured party participates in the third class to the extent its claim is not covered by its collateral.

The notification to the debtors of the claims assignment is not a legal requirement for the validity thereof.

However, until such time as any debtor of the receivables has been notified of the claims assignment, such debtor may
validly discharge its debt in the hands of the assignor, thereby voiding the security interest. The foregoing is of particular
relevance in the context of assignment of trade receivables where such assignment is generally not notified to the debtors
until the occurrence of an event of default.

Claims assigned for security purposes by a Swiss entity that come into existence prior to the opening of

bankruptcy can be enforced by the assignee outside Swiss bankruptcy proceedings. Assigned claims that come into
existence after the opening of bankruptcy over a Swiss entity may fall within the bankrupt estate, and the assignee may
not be entitled to such claim proceeds.

Swiss insolvency laws also provide for reorganization procedures by composition with the debtor’s creditors.

Reorganization is initiated by a request with the competent court for a stay (Nachlassstundung) pending negotiation of
the composition agreement with the creditors and confirmation of such agreement by the competent court. A distinction
is made between a composition agreement providing for the assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit
_Vermögensabtretung) which leads to a private liquidation and in many instances has analogous effects as a bankruptcy,_
and a dividend composition (Dividenden-Vergleich) providing for the payment of a certain percentage on the creditors’
claims and the continuation of the debtor. Further, there is the possibility of a composition in the form of a mere payment
term extension (Stundungsvergleich). During a moratorium, debt collection proceedings cannot be initiated and pending
proceedings are stayed. Furthermore, the debtor’s power to dispose of its assets and to manage its affairs is restricted. In
case of a pledge, the secured party is not entitled to proceed with a private liquidation until the confirmation of the
settlement by the competent court. A secured creditor participates in the settlement only for the amount of its claim not
covered by the collateral. The moratorium does not affect the agreed due dates of debts (contrary to bankruptcy, in which
case all debts become immediately due upon adjudication). The moratorium aims at facilitating the conclusion of one of
the above composition agreements. Any composition agreement needs to be approved by the creditors and confirmed by
the competent court. With the judicial confirmation, the composition agreement becomes binding on all creditors,
whereby secured claims are only subject to the composition agreement to the extent that the collateral proves to be
insufficient to cover the secured claims.

Foreign bankruptcy decrees may be recognized in Switzerland only, provided that (i) the bankruptcy decree is

enforceable in the country where it was issued, (ii) its recognition is, inter alia, not against Swiss public policy, and
(iii) it was either issued in the country of the debtor’ domicile or in the country where the debtor has its center of main
interest, provided that the debtor was not domiciled in Switzerland at the time the foreign bankruptcy proceedings were
initiated.

**_Avoidance_**

Certain arrangements or dispositions that are made during a certain period (the “suspect period”) preceding the

declaration of bankruptcy or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag
_mit Vermögensabtretung) may be challenged by the receiver in bankruptcy (Konkursverwaltung) and certain creditors_


-----

under the applicable rules of avoidance. The avoidance may relate to (i) gifts, gratuitous transactions and transactions
pursuant to which the debtor received consideration which was disproportionate to its own performance made in the
suspect period of 12 months prior to being declared bankrupt or the confirmation of a composition agreement with
assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung), (ii) certain acts of a debtor in the suspect period of
12 months prior to being declared bankrupt or the confirmation of a composition agreement with assignment of assets
(Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) if the debtor at that time was overindebted, and (iii) dispositions made by the
debtor within a suspect period of five years prior to being declared bankrupt or the confirmation of a composition
agreement with assignment of assets (Nachlassvertrag mit Vermögensabtretung) with the intent to disadvantage its
creditors or to prefer certain of its creditors to the detriment of other creditors. The transactions potentially subject to
avoidance also include those contemplated by a Swiss entity’s guarantee of the Notes or the granting of security interests
under the Security Documents by a Swiss entity. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted by a Swiss entity
under the guarantee of the Notes or in connection with security interests under the Security Documents may become
unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the bankrupt estate.

**_Parallel Debt_**

Under Swiss law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the pledgee

and the creditor be the same person. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to have a secured claim
the security documents provide for the creation of an independent right of performance of the Security Agent by way of a
joint and several creditor concert and an abstract acknowledgement of debt. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the Security
Trustee becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges
governed by Swiss law will directly secure the parallel debt. There is no assurance that such a structure will be effective
before the Swiss courts as there is no judicial or other guidance as to its efficacy, and therefore the ability of the Security
Agent to enforce the collateral may be restricted.

**United States**

**_Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance

laws, the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes, the issuance of the guarantees and the grant of security, whether
now or in the future, by the Issuer and the Guarantors (together, the “Obligors”) could be avoided, if, among other
things, at the time the Obligors incurred the obligations, issued the related guarantee or gave the security, the Obligors
intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor; or received less than reasonably equivalent value or
fair consideration for the incurrence of such indebtedness or the grant of such security and either:

      - were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence or grant of security;

      - were engaged in a business or transaction for which the Obligors’ remaining assets constituted
unreasonably small capital; or

      - intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as they
mature.

A U.S. court would likely find that an Obligor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration

for the Notes offered hereby or such guarantee if such Obligor did not benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of
the Notes or the applicable guarantee.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not an Obligor was solvent

at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that payments to holders of the Notes offered hereby
constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent by a U.S.
court if, at the time it incurred indebtedness:

      - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;

      - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature;
or

      - it could not pay its debts as they become due.

If the Notes offered hereby or guarantees were avoided or limited under fraudulent transfer or other laws, any

claim you may make against any Obligor for amounts payable on the Notes offered hereby would be unenforceable to the


-----

extent of such avoidance or limitation. Moreover, the court could order you to return any payments previously made by
any Obligor.

Although any guarantee entered into in connection with the issuance of the Notes offered hereby will contain a

provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the
incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective to protect
such guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount
that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

**_Federal Insolvency Proceedings_**

Certain Obligors may have operations that would be subject either to proceedings under title 11 of the U.S.

Bankruptcy Code or any applicable state law insolvency proceedings. Proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code vary
and provide a debtor with discretion in its pursuit of a liquidation or reorganization strategy, subject to the rights of
creditors and other parties in interest to object and seek relief from the bankruptcy court. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code
provides a detailed statutory framework that, among other things, contains terms or provisions relating to:

      - the administration of a bankruptcy case, including (i) the imposition of the automatic stay, which
immediately stays all litigation, as well as most enforcement and other actions against the debtors or
property of the bankruptcy estate; (ii) provision of “adequate protection” to secured creditors to protect
against diminution of value of their collateral; (iii) terms for the use, sale or lease of property; (iv) standards
for obtaining post-petition credit; and (v) rules regarding the treatment of executory contracts and unexpired
leases;

      - creditors and claims, including deadlines and requirements for filing proofs of claim, the priority and
allowance of claims, and subordination of claims; and

      - creation of the bankruptcy estate, including the scope of property of the estate and ability to bring turnover
and avoidance actions, provisions relating to liquidation under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
reorganization under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the filing of ancillary and other
cross-border insolvency cases under chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

As a general matter, chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides for the orderly liquidation of the debtor’s

assets by a trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court and typically results in the immediate shutdown of the debtor’s
business. Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code is available to debtors who seek to continue to operate their business
as a going concern while they reorganise their businesses and resolve their obligations to creditors (although a liquidation
or sale under chapter 11 is also possible), in each case pursuant to a plan of reorganization or liquidation, as applicable.
Unlike in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case the debtor typically remains in possession of its
assets and continues to operate its business during the course of the bankruptcy case (subject to the supervision of the
bankruptcy court), with substantially the rights that a trustee would otherwise have. In addition, “liquidating” chapter 11
cases may be used as an alternative to a liquidation under chapter 7, particularly in an instance when the debtor seeks to
maintain the “going-concern value” of its business and/or expects to sell all or substantially all of its assets free and clear
of liens during the course of the bankruptcy case.

Because bankruptcy proceedings are often fact specific and vary case-by-case, and because bankruptcy courts

are courts of equity with broad discretionary powers, a detailed summary of all the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code that could affect the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes, and/or the guarantees and security is not contained herein.
Furthermore, the common law applicable in bankruptcy proceedings may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this
summary is not intended to cover the common law that may apply in any particular jurisdiction.

**_Preference_**

Any future grant of security interest with regard to the Collateral in favor of the Notes, including pursuant to

security documents delivered after the date of the Indenture, might be avoidable in a U.S. bankruptcy case by the grantor
(as debtor-in-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a preference if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if the grantor is insolvent at the time of the grant, the security interest permits the holders of the
Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the bankruptcy case were a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and
the security had not been given and a bankruptcy case in respect of the grantor is commenced within 90 days following
the grant, or in certain circumstances, a longer period.


-----

**_The Automatic Stay_**

The right of a holder of the Notes to enforce its security interests against the Obligors upon the occurrence of an

event of default under the Indenture governing the Notes is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable U.S.
bankruptcy law if one or more of the Obligors became a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before such
security interest was enforced. Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor
such as a holder of Notes is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from taking any act
to obtain possession of or exercise control over, property of the bankruptcy estate. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy
case of one or more of the Obligors could therefore prevent the holders of the Notes from obtaining possession or
exercising control over the Collateral or commencing any action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control
over the Collateral. The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain
circumstances, but parties may object to any creditor request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy
court deny such a request.

**_Right of Debtor-In-Possession to Remain In Control of Collateral and the Bankruptcy Process_**

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its

property and is authorized to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession,” subject to certain limitations.
This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a chapter 7
liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral even though the

debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate
protection” of its interest in the debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other
relief, in each case to the extent that the collateral decreases in value during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a
result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of the automatic stay.

The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A U.S.

bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to additional adequate protection for a diminution
in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures.

Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a

plan within the first 120 days of the case or fails to solicit sufficient acceptances of its plan within the first 180 days of
the case. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods. The 120-day period could be extended for up to
18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11
filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other parties such as secured creditors would be precluded from proposing or
soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans.

In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” the exclusive

periods, and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

      - whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests;

      - the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed
or confirmed; or

      - whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of
value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.”

**_A Debtor-In-Possession May Obtain New Credit Secured By a Lien That is Senior or Equal to Existing Liens_**

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an extension

of new credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts and
circumstances, authorize the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is secured by a
lien that is senior or equal to existing liens. In other words, it is possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one
or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is
senior or equal to the liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11 filing.

**_Ability to Confirm a Chapter 11 Plan Notwithstanding the Dissenting Votes of Creditors_**

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can be imposed on a creditor or equityholder (or class of

creditors or equityholders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of


-----

all claims asserted against the debtor and its property, and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment of equity
interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan
may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the
plan, and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interest that receive no distributions under the plan are not
entitled to vote on the plan, and are deemed to reject it.

A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if more than one-half in number of claims holders and two-thirds

in claims amount in that class vote in favor of the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the
dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes
reject the plan, it may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down”
provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, so long as the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with
respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the
debtor or other plan proponent to confirm its plan over the objection of one or more dissenting classes.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Dollar Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act

will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes”). The Dollar Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on
Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Dollar Global Notes”).

The Euro Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act will

initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Rule 144A
**Euro Global Notes”). The Euro Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in reliance on Regulation S**
will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Euro Global Notes”). The Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes and the Regulation S Dollar Global Notes are
collectively referred to herein as the “Dollar Global Notes”. The Rule 144A Euro Global Notes and the Regulation S
Euro Global Notes are collectively referred to herein as the “Euro Global Notes”. The Rule 144A Dollar Global Notes
and the Rule 144A Euro Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Rule 144A Global Notes”. The Regulation S
Dollar Global Notes and the Regulation S Euro Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Regulation S Global
**Notes”. The Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global**
**Notes”.**

The Dollar Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for The Depository Trust Company

(“DTC”) and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The Euro Global Notes will be deposited with,
or on behalf of, a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and
registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and in the

Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, collectively with the Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, as applicable, or persons that hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown
on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Dollar Global Notes will be issued only in
denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and the Book-Entry Interests in the Euro
Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as

applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the
interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United
States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The
foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes
are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered in their name, will not have
received physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders”
of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC (or its nominee) or the Common Depositary

for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holder of the
Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any
rights of holders of Notes under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Registrar, the Common Depositary, the nominee of the Common

Depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, DTC, the nominee of the custodian for DTC, the Trustee under the Indenture
nor any of the Issuer’s respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to
the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Notes in definitive registered

form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):


-----

(1) if DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes) or Euroclear or Clearstream (with respect to the Euro
Global Notes) notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a
successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if DTC (with respect to the Dollar Global Notes) or Euroclear or Clearstream (with respect to the Euro
Global Notes) so requests following an Event of Default (as defined under “Description of the Notes”)
under the Indenture; or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest

described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or causes to
be issued Definitive Registered Notes to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the
initial request.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and

issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or the
Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear
the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,

will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry
Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or
any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer
than all of the relevant Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as
they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000, in the case of the
Dollar Global Notes or €100,000, in the case of the Euro Global Notes, principal amount at maturity, or less, may be
redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional

interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent will, in turn,
make such payments to DTC (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) or to Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in the case of
the Euro Global Notes), which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective
procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar

and the Paying Agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent nor any Paying Agent or
any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

      - any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating
to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by DTC, Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

      - payments made by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

      - DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.


-----

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of

such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street name.”

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar Global

Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes (the “DTC Holders”) through DTC in dollars. The principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro Global Notes will be paid to
holders of interest in such notes (the “Euroclear/Clearstream Holders”) through Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by

a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or
more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents or waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, each of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC will be done in accordance with DTC’s rules and will be settled in

immediately available funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in
accordance with Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of
Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states
which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its
interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC or Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in the

Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of the Offering of the Notes and the

closing of the Offering (the “40-day Period”), beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred to a
person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same currency
only if such transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A and the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a certificate (in the
form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably
believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Notice to Investors” and in
accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

After the expiration of the 40-day Period, beneficial interests in a Regulation S Global Note may be transferred

to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the Rule 144A Global Note denominated in the same
currency without compliance with these certification requirements.

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form

of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only upon receipt by the
Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer
is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the Securities Act (if available).

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and

exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange”. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of
the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other
Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global
Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long
as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only

as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first


-----

delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as

applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of
investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be
changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are responsible for those
operations or procedures.

DTC has advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking

Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve
System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset
servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market
instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among
direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized
book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities
Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is
owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S.
and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly.

Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the

clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets.

Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and

dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also
available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a Euroclear and/or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of

indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require
that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear
and Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Euro MTF and listed

on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules
and operating procedures.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate

transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they
are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or
modified at any time. None of the Issuer, any Guarantor, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or any Paying
Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants
or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Dollar Global Notes will be made in dollars and initial settlement for the Euro Global

Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the


-----

settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to
the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement
date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in

same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of
any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be
made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other

communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for
business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions

involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find
that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels
if Euroclear is used.

**Trustee’s Powers**

In considering the interests of the holders of the Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the name of a

nominee of a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to, and rely on, any information provided to it by that clearing
system as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its account holders with entitlements to Notes and may
consider such interests as if such account holders were the holders of the Notes.

**Enforcement**

For the purposes of enforcement of the provisions of the Indenture by the Trustee, the persons named in a

certificate of the holder of the Notes in respect of which a Global Note is issued shall be recognized as the beneficiaries
of the trusts set out in the Indenture to the extent of the principal amounts of their interests in the Notes set out in the
certificate of the holder, as if they were themselves the holders of the Notes in such principal amounts.


-----

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a description of certain tax considerations relating to a holding of the Notes. It does not_

_purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes_
_should consult their tax advisers as to the consequences under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident for_
_tax purposes and the tax laws of any other jurisdiction of acquiring, holding, redeeming and disposing of the Notes and_
_receiving payments and/or other amounts thereunder. This summary is based upon the law as in effect on the date hereof_
_and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date, and may be retroactively applicable._

**United Kingdom Tax Considerations**

The following is a general description of certain U.K. tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing of

the Notes and is based on the Issuer’s understanding of current U.K. law and HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”)
published practice as at the date hereof (which may not be binding on HMRC), both of which are subject to change,
possibly with retrospective effect. This description is not exhaustive and relates only to the position of persons who are
the absolute beneficial owners of the Notes and may not apply to certain classes of persons, such as brokers, dealers in
securities, individuals holding the Notes through an ISA, persons connected with the Issuer or certain professional
investors, to whom special rules may apply. Further, these comments do not deal with holders of the Notes who are
individuals treated as non-domiciled in the United Kingdom for U.K. tax purposes. This description does not purport to
constitute legal or tax advice and any holders who are in any doubt as to their tax position should consult their
independent professional advisors. Any holders (or propspective holders) of the Notes who are subject to tax in a
jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom should consult their independent professional advisors.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

The Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds” within the meaning of Section 987 of the Income Tax Act 2007

(“ITA”) while they carry a right to interest and are and remain listed on a “recognised stock exchange” within the
meaning of Section 1005 of the ITA for the purposes of Section 987 of the ITA, or are admitted to trading on a
“multilateral trading facility” operated by a “regulated recognised stock exchange” within the meaning of Section 987 of
the ITA. While the Notes are, and continue to be, quoted Eurobonds, payments of interest on the Notes may be made
without deduction or withholding for or on account of U.K. income tax. Securities that have been admitted to the Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market will meet the requirement
to be listed on a recognised stock exchange. So long as this remains the case with respect to the Notes and the Notes
carry a right to interest, they will therefore constitute quoted Eurobonds.

If the Notes do not (or cease to) constitute “quoted Eurobonds,” an amount may, subject to any relief available

under any applicable double taxation treaty and to the availability of any other relief or exemption, have to be withheld
on account of U.K. income tax from payments of interest on the Notes at the “basic rate” of U.K. income tax (currently
20%).

If interest were to be paid under deduction of U.K. income tax, holders of the Notes who are not resident in the

United Kingdom for tax purposes may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate
provision in an applicable double taxation treaty.

Where Notes are issued on terms that a premium is or may be payable on redemption then any such element of

premium may constitute a payment of interest for tax purposes and, if so, the provisions described above relevant to
interest will apply.

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor which is resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or which otherwise makes a payment

which is considered to arise in the United Kingdom for the purposes of Part 15 of the ITA makes any payments in respect
of interest on the Notes (or other amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for the
Notes), it is possible that such payments may be subject to U.K. withholding tax, subject to any claim which could be
made under an applicable double taxation treaty or any other relief or exemption which may apply. Such payments by a
Guarantor may not be eligible for the quoted Eurobond exmption described above.

The references to “interest” and “premium” in the “Interest on the Notes” and “Payments by a Guarantor”

sections above are to “interest” and “premium” as understood for the purposes of U.K. tax law. They do not take into
account any different definitions of “interest” and “premium” that may prevail under any other tax law or that may apply
under the terms and conditions of the Notes or any related document.


-----

**_Tax by Direct Assessment_**

Interest on the Notes may constitute U.K. source income for U.K. tax purposes and accordingly may be

chargeable to U.K. income or corporation tax by direct assessment even where paid without deduction or withholding.
However, the interest will not generally be assessed to U.K. tax in the hands of holders of the Notes who are not resident
for tax purposes in the United Kingdom, except where the holder carries on a trade, profession or vocation through a
branch or agency (or, in the case of a corporate holder, a permanent establishment) in the United Kingdom in connection
with which the interest is received or to which the Notes are attributable, in which case (subject to exemptions for interest
received by certain categories of agent) U.K. corporation or income tax may be levied on the U.K. branch, agency or
permanent establishment.

Holders of the Notes may wish to note that the provision referred to in “Description of the Notes—Payments of

Additional Amounts” would not apply if HMRC sought to assess directly the person entitled to the relevant interest to
U.K. tax. However, exemption from, or reduction of, such U.K. tax liability might be available under an applicable
double taxation treaty.

**_United Kingdom Holders Subject to Corporation Tax_**

In general, holders of the Notes who are within the charge to U.K. corporation tax will be charged to tax on

income in respect of all profits, gains and losses on, and fluctuations in value of, the Notes (whether attributable to
currency fluctuations or otherwise) measured and recognized in each accounting period broadly in accordance with their
statutory accounting treatment, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, under the “loan
relationships” rules in Part 5 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009.

**_United Kingdom Holders not Subject to Corporation Tax_**

Assuming that the Notes do not constitute “deeply discounted securities” for the purposes of Chapter 8 of Part 4

of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, the disposal of the Notes by an individual holder who is
resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom or who carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom
through a branch or agency to which the Notes are attributable may give rise to a chargeable gain or allowable loss for
the purposes of U.K. tax on chargeable gains, depending on individual circumstances. In calculating any gain or
allowable loss on the disposal of the Notes, sterling values are compared at acquisition and disposal. Accordingly, a
taxable gain can arise even where the euro amount received on a disposal is less than or the same as the euro amount paid
for the Notes.

Special rules may apply to individuals who have ceased to be resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom

and who dispose of their Notes before becoming once again resident in the U.K. Noteholders are advised to consult their
own professional advisors if they require any advice or further information relating to residency.

On the disposal of Notes by a holder (assuming Notes do not constitute deeply discounted securities), any

interest which has accrued since the last interest payment date may be chargeable to tax on income under the rule relating
to accrued income profits as set out in Chapter 2 of Part 12 of the ITA if that holder is resident for tax purposes in the
United Kingdom.

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_**

No U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable on the issue of the Notes. No U.K. stamp duty

or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable on a transfer of, or an agreement to transfer, the Notes provided that the
Notes do not carry and will not at any time carry (i) a right to interest the amount of which exceeds a reasonable
commercial return on the nominal amount of the capital nor (ii) a right to interest the amount of which falls to be
determined to any extent by reference to the results of, or any part of, a business or to the value of any property, nor
(iii) a right on repayment to an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the capital and is not reasonably
comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of capital) under the terms of issue
of loan capital (as that term is understood for the purposes of section 79 of the Finance Act 1986) listed in the Official
List of the London Stock Exchange.

**Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion is a summary based on present law of the material U.S. federal income tax

considerations relevant to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion addresses only U.S.
Holders (as defined below) who purchase the Notes in the original issuance at their respective issue price (generally, the
first price at which a substantial amount of such Notes is sold to the public for cash), hold the Notes as capital assets and


-----

use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This summary does not address the tax consequences to subsequent
purchasers of the Notes.

This discussion is not a complete description of all U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Notes.

It does not address the tax treatment of prospective purchasers subject to special rules, such as banks, dealers, traders that
elect to mark to market, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, grantor
trusts, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, U.S. expatriates, certain accrual method taxpayers who are
required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is taken into account
for financial accounting purposes, tax-exempt entities or persons holding the Notes as part of a hedge, straddle,
conversion or other integrated financial transaction. This summary does not discuss any tax consequences arising under
the U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws or the laws of any state, local, non-U.S. or other taxing jurisdiction.

**YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE PARTICULAR U.S.**

**FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF PURCHASING, HOLDING AND DISPOSING OF**
**THE NOTES, AS WELL AS THE CONSEQUENCES TO YOU ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY**
**OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION OR DUE TO CHANGES IN TAX LAW.**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner that is, for purposes of U.S. federal

income taxation, (i) a citizen or resident alien of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or other entity treated as a
corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or its political subdivisions, (iii) a trust that
(a) is subject to the control of a U.S. person and the primary supervision of a U.S. court or (b) has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person or (iv) an estate, the income of which is
subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.

If a partnership (or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)

acquires or holds the Notes, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. A partner or partnership considering acquiring or holding the Notes should consult its own
tax advisor.

This summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury

regulations promulgated thereunder, rulings and judicial decisions all as of the date hereof, which are subject to change
(possibly with retroactive effect), so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those
summarized below. No rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or will be sought with respect to
the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes and that any such position would not be sustained.

**_Effect of Certain Contingencies_**

In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay amounts on the Notes in addition to stated principal and

interest (e.g., in the circumstances described under “Description of the Notes—Payment of Additional Amounts,”
“Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of the Notes—Purchase of Notes upon a Change of
Control”). These potential payments may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to “contingent
payment debt instruments.” One or more contingencies will not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt
instruments if, as of the Issue Date, such contingencies, in the aggregate, are considered remote or incidental. Although
the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the possibility of such additional payments does not
result in the Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under applicable Treasury regulations. This
position will be based on our determination that, as of the Issue Date, the possibility that additional payments will be
made is, in the aggregate, a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations.
Assuming such position is respected, you would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional
payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with your regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Our determination that these contingencies are remote or incidental is binding on a holder, unless such holder

explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different
position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above,
then the Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. In that case, regardless of a holder’s regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation may be
required to accrue ordinary interest income on the Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest, and to treat any gain
realized on the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Notes as ordinary income rather than capital gain. You
are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent
payment debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


-----

**_Stated Interest_**

Generally, stated interest on the Notes will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it accrues or is

received, in accordance with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Stated interest will
be income from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, will generally be
considered passive category income.

If you use the cash basis method of accounting, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value

of the amount received. For Euro Notes, this amount is determined by translating the euros received at the “spot rate” in
effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not
recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment of stated interest, but may recognize
exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received.

If you use the accrual method of accounting, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect

to interest received on Euro Notes in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required
to include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such year,
determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period during which such interest accrued,
or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the
second method, you may elect to translate stated interest income at the spot rate on (i) the last day of the accrual period,
(ii) the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year or (iii) the date the stated interest
payment is received if such date is within five days of the end of the accrual period. Such election must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. In addition,
upon receipt of a stated interest payment in euros (including amounts received upon the sale, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you will recognize exchange gain or
loss, generally treated as U.S. source ordinary income or loss (and not as an adjustment to interest income or expense), in
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the
euros received at the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt) and the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest income that
you previously included in income with respect to such payment, regardless of whether the payment is actually converted
into U.S. dollars.

**_Sale, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition_**

You generally will recognize gain or loss on a sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note in an

amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (less any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which if not
previously included in income is taxed as interest income) and your adjusted tax basis in the Note. Your adjusted tax
basis in a Note generally will be the U.S. dollar cost for the Note. If you purchased a Note with euros, your cost generally
will be the U.S. dollar value of the euros paid for such Note determined at the spot rate on the date of such purchase (or,
in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the purchase, if the Note is traded on
an established securities market). If your Note is sold, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for
euros, then your amount realized generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the consideration, which, in the case of a Euro
Note, will be any euros received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such sale, redemption or other taxable
disposition (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of the sale or other
taxable disposition, if the Note is traded on an established securities market). If you use the accrual method of accounting
and have not elected to translate euro amounts at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date, upon receipt of a
payment in euros, you may recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference
(if any) between the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the spot rates in effect on the date of sale,
redemption or other taxable disposition and the settlement date.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss on disposition of a Note generally will

be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if you have held the Note for more than one
year at the time of disposition. A non-corporate U.S. Holder generally will be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any
long term capital gain recognized. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations.


-----

A portion of your gain or loss on a sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note may be treated

as exchange gain or loss. Such exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S.
source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Euro Notes is your purchase price for the Euro Note
calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference
between the (i) U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, redemption or other taxable
disposition of the Euro Note (or on the settlement date, if you are a cash basis taxpayer or an electing accrual basis
taxpayer and the Euro Note is traded on an established securities market) and (ii) U.S. dollar value of the principal
amount determined on the date you purchased the Euro Note. The amount of exchange gain or loss with respect to the
principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss
realized on the disposition of the Euro Note. In certain circumstances, U.S. Treasury Regulations require foreign
exchange losses in excess of a threshold amount to be reported to the IRS. If you hold a Euro Note, you should consult
your tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Euro Note, including
any requirement to file IRS Form 8886.

**_Exchange of Foreign Currency_**

On a sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of foreign currency, you generally will recognize gain or loss

in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair market value in U.S. dollars of
other property, received by you in the disposition and (ii) your tax basis in the foreign currency. Any such gain or loss
will be ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense, except to the extent provided by
administrative pronouncements of the IRS. Foreign currency received as interest on a Euro Note or on the sale,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note will have a tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time the
foreign currency is received (including foreign currency received from the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note that is traded on established securities market in the case of an accrual basis taxpayer that does not make the
election described above, once exchange gain or loss, if any, has been realized for the period between the trade date and
the settlement date, as described above). Foreign currency that is purchased will generally have a tax basis equal to the
U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency on the date of purchase.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of interest and proceeds from the sale, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note may be

reported to the IRS unless you establish a basis for exemption. Backup withholding may apply to amounts subject to
reporting if you fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or, in the case of interest payments including
OID, if any, fail either to report in full dividend and interest income or, in either case, fail to make certain certifications.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. You generally can claim a credit against your U.S. federal income tax
liability for the amount of any backup withholding and a refund of any excess, provided that the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess of $50,000 on the last

day of the tax year or $75,000 at any time during the tax year are generally required to file information reports with
respect to such assets with their U.S. federal income tax returns. Depending on the individual’s circumstances, higher
threshold amounts may apply. “Specified foreign financial assets” include any financial accounts maintained by foreign
financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are not held in accounts maintained by financial
institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-U.S. persons, (ii) financial instruments and contracts held for
investment that have non-U.S. issuers or counterparties and (iii) interests in non-U.S. entities. The Notes may be treated
as specified foreign financial assets. You may be subject to this information reporting regime and required to file IRS
Form 8938 listing these assets with your U.S. federal income tax return. Failure to file information reports may subject
you to penalties. You are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding your obligations to file information reports
with respect to the Notes.

**_Additional Tax on Net Investment Income_**

The “net investment income” (or undistributed “net investment income,” in the case of a trust or estate) of

certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, trusts or estates and that have modified adjusted gross income (or adjusted gross
income, in the case of a trust or estate) above a certain threshold (which in the case of an individual is between $125,000
and $250,000, depending on the individual’s circumstances) is subject to a 3.8% tax, in addition to otherwise applicable
U.S. federal income tax. A U.S. Holder’s “net investment income” generally includes, among other things, interest
income on and capital gain from the disposition of securities like the Notes, subject to certain exceptions. If you are a
U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate or trust, you are urged to consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicability
of this tax to your investment in the Notes.

Notes offered hereby.

The Notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the securities

laws of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable securities laws
in any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and sold only to qualified institutional
buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to
non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (and only to investors
who: (a) if resident in a Member State of the EEA, are not retail investors, defined as a person who is one (or more) of:
(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or not a “qualified investor” as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation; or (b) if resident in

-----

memorandum has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment
decision with respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person
representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy, adequacy or
completeness of this offering memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the Notes as you have deemed necessary in connection with your
decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request

(4) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which
you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer
or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act, any state securities
laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, subject to any requirement of law that the
disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within
its or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A,
Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities Act.

(5) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing the
Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to
offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Notes (but, in the case of Regulation S Notes, only prior to the
date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is 40 days after the later of the date of the
original issue and the last date on which the Issuer or any of its affiliates was the owner of such Notes
(or any predecessor thereto)) only (i) to the Issuer, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been
declared effective under the Securities Act, (iii) for so long as the Notes are eligible pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to a person you reasonably believe is a QIB that purchases for its

reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, (iv) to non-U.S. persons pursuant to offers and sales
that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act or

information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that a
certificate of transfer in the form appearing on the reverse of the security is completed and delivered by
the transferor to the Trustee. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the
Resale Restriction Termination Date.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE

**ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase and holding of the Notes by

any purchaser, including, without limitation, any fiduciary purchasing on behalf of (i) an employee benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) subject to the
provisions of Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or a plan, individual retirement account or other arrangement to
which Section 4975 of the Code applies (each, an “ERISA Plan”), (ii) an entity whose underlying assets include “plan
assets” with respect to an ERISA Plan by reason of an ERISA Plan’s investment in such entity or otherwise (each, a
“Benefit Plan Investor”) or (iii) a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement that is subject to any
Federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility or
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or the provisions of Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”) (together
with ERISA Plan, “Plans”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of an ERISA Plan and prohibit

certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA
and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of an ERISA Plan
or the management or disposition of the assets of an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation with respect to the assets of an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in

accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or
any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification,
delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each ERISA Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the

Trustee or any of their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is acting as a fiduciary to any ERISA Plan with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial
investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the
Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific
purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific
purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective ERISA Plan purchaser
on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified

transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is
available.

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to

excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan
that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the
Code. The acquisition, holding and/or disposition of Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which a Transaction Party
is considered a party in interest or disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction
under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in
accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, certain
exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules could be applicable to the purchase and holding of notes by a Plan,
depending on the type and circumstances of the fiduciary making the decision to acquire such notes and the relationship
of the party in interest or disqualified person to the Plan. Included among these exemptions are Section 408(b)(17) of
ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain transactions between a Plan and non-fiduciary service providers
to the Plan. In addition, the United States Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions
(“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions (as may be amended from
time to time) include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 (respecting transactions effected by independent “qualified
professional asset managers”), PTCE 90-1 (respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts), PTCE 91-38
(respecting bank collective investment funds), PTCE 95-60 (respecting insurance company general accounts) and PTCE
96-23 (respecting transactions directed by in-house asset managers).

Each of these PTCEs contains conditions and limitations on its application. Thus, the fiduciaries of a Plan that is

considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance of any of these, or any other, PTCEs should carefully review


-----

the conditions and limitations of the PTCE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be
no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTCE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any
particular transaction involving the Notes.

Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of

any Plan, unless such acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

The transferee or holder of the Notes will be deemed to have represented, agreed and acknowledged (as

applicable) in its corporate and fiduciary capacity, that:

(a) With respect to the acquisition, holding and disposition of the Notes, or any interest therein, (1) either

(A) it is not, and it is not acting directly or indirectly on behalf of (and for so long as it holds such Notes or any interest
therein will not be, and will not be acting directly or indirectly on behalf of), a Plan, a Benefit Plan Investor, or a
governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement that is subject to Similar Laws, and no part of the assets
used or to be used by it to acquire or hold such Notes or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any such Plan,
Benefit Plan Investor or governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement that is subject to Similar Laws, or
(B) (i) its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes or any interest therein does not and will not constitute or
otherwise result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Part 4 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code, as applicable (or, in the case of a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement, a violation of
any applicable Similar Laws); and (ii) none of the Transaction Parties is a sponsor of, or a fiduciary (within the meaning
of Section 3(21) of ERISA or, with respect to a governmental, church or non-U.S. plan or other arrangement, any
definition of “fiduciary,” or any substantially similar concept, under any applicable Similar Laws) with respect to the
purchaser, transferee or holder in connection with any acquisition, holding or disposition of such Notes, or as a result of
any exercise by the Issuer or any of its affiliates of any rights in connection with such Notes, and no advice provided by
the Issuer or any of their affiliates has formed a primary basis for any investment or other decision by or on behalf of the
purchaser, transferee or holder in connection with such Notes and the transactions contemplated with respect to such
Notes; and (2) it will not sell or otherwise transfer such Notes or any interest therein other than to a purchaser or
transferee that is deemed (or if required by the applicable indenture, certified) to make these same representations,
warranties and agreements with respect to its acquisition, holding and disposition of such Notes or any interest therein.

(b) The acquirer and any fiduciary causing it to acquire an interest in any Notes agrees to indemnify and

hold harmless the Issuer, the guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and their respective affiliates, from and
against any cost, damage or loss incurred by any of them as a result of any of the foregoing representations and
agreements being or becoming false.

(c) Any purported acquisition or transfer of any Note or beneficial interest therein to a purchaser or

transferee that does not comply with the requirements of the above provisions shall be void ab initio.

The foregoing discussion is necessarily general in nature, is not intended to be all-inclusive, and should not be

construed as legal advice or a legal opinion. Further, no assurance can be given that future legislation, administrative
rulings, court decisions or regulatory action will not modify the conclusions set forth in this discussion. Any such
changes may be retroactive and thereby apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment or release.
Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt
prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and
holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such transactions and whether an exemption
would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. The sale of a Note to a Plan is in no respect a
representation by any Transaction Party or any of their respective representatives that such an investment meets all
relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plan or that such investment is appropriate for any
such Plan.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement dated February 9, 2023 among us, and

the Euro Initial Purchasers (the “Euro **Purchase Agreement”) and in the purchase agreement dated February 9, 2023**
among us, and the Dollar Initial Purchasers (the “Dollar **Purchase Agreement” and, together with the Euro Purchase**
Agreement, the “Purchase Agreements”), we sold to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers, severally and not
jointly, purchased from us the entire principal amount of the Notes.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreements, the applicable Initial Purchasers have

agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes sold under the applicable Purchase Agreement if any of the
Notes are purchased. If an Initial Purchaser defaults, each Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments
of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or such Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Initial
Purchasers may make offers and sales into the United States through U.S. broker-dealers.

We have agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the

Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The Initial Purchasers are offering the Notes, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by

them, subject to approval of legal matters by their counsel, including the validity of the Notes and other conditions
contained in the Purchase Agreements, such as the receipt by the Initial Purchasers of officer’s certificates and legal
opinions. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in
whole or in part.

ICBC Standard Bank Plc is restricted in its U.S. securities dealings under the United States Bank Holding

Company Act and may not underwrite, subscribe, agree to purchase or procure purchasers to purchase Notes that are
offered or sold in the United States. Accordingly, ICBC Standard Bank Plc shall not be obligated to, and shall not,
underwrite, subscribe, agree to purchase or procure purchasers to purchase Notes that may be offered or sold by other
Initial Purchasers in the United States. ICBC Standard Bank Plc shall offer and sell the Notes constituting part of its
allotment solely outside the United States.

**Offer Price**

The Initial Purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes at the respective offering prices set forth on the cover

page of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of
the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and
sell the Notes through certain of their affiliates. Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC
and, therefore, may not make sales of any Notes in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with
applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To the extent that any Initial Purchasers that are not U.S. registered broker dealers
intend to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, they will only do so through one or more U.S. registered
broker dealers affiliates as permitted by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority guidelines.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The Notes and the guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be

offered or sold within the United States except to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the
Securities Act and to persons who are not U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. In addition, until 40 days following the later of (i) the
commencement of the Offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes initially sold in reliance
on Regulation S within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or
another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to
them by Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made
acknowledgments, representations and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.”

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the

Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or
distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where
action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither
this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be
distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and
regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into
whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any


-----

restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to
Investors.”

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or

otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract
or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or the safe harbor of
Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes.

**EEA**

(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not

No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation; and

      - has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in
which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and

      - has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA in respect of anything done by it
in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**New Issue of Securities**

The Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market. We do not

intend to apply for listing of the Euro Notes and Dollar Notes on any U.S. securities exchange or for inclusion of such
Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. We have been advised by certain of the Initial Purchasers that they
presently intend to make a market in the Notes after completion of the Offering. However, they are under no obligation to
do so and may discontinue any market making activities at any time without any notice. We cannot assure the liquidity of


-----

the trading market for the Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity
of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering
price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial
condition, general economic conditions and other factors. There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in
which case your ability to sell your Notes may be limited. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our
Capital Structure—Lack of public market—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your
ability to sell your Notes may be limited.”

We have applied to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and trade the Notes on

the Euro MTF Market, however, we cannot assure you that such listing will be maintained.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period of 60 days after February 9, 2023, without the prior written

consent of the Representatives, directly or indirectly, pledge, issue, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of, or
otherwise dispose of any of our other debt securities having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue,
except for debt securities (A) issued or guaranteed in accordance with, or as permitted under, the Senior Secured Term
Loans Agreement, (B) issued or guaranteed in connection with the sales of receivables pursuant to securitization or
factoring arrangements or issuances of debt securities pursuant to sales of such receivables, or the implementation of any
receivables securitization or factoring facility or (C) issued or guaranteed in immaterial amounts in the ordinary course of
business.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) may engage in

transactions that stabilize the market price of the Notes. Such transactions consist of bids or purchases to peg, fix or
maintain the price of the Notes. Purchases of a security to stabilize the price or to reduce a short position may cause the
price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open market.

These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales.
Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of the Notes than they are required to
purchase in the Offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing the Notes in the open
market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward
pressure on the price of the Notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in
the Offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales may

have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a decline in the market
price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open
market.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates make any representation or prediction as to the

direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In addition,
neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates make any representation that the representatives will engage
in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

Any stabilizing action, if commenced, must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date and

60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital
Structure—Lack of public market—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability
to sell your Notes may be limited.”

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities,

which may include securities trading, commercial investment banking, financial advising, investment management,
principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have
engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking, financial advisory, consulting, commercial banking and
other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us, our principal shareholders or our affiliates,
including assistance with open-market repurchasing and ESG ratings advisory. They have received, and expect to
receive, customary fees, commissions and expense reimbursements for these transactions. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers or their respective affiliates may from time to time also enter into swap and other derivative transactions with
us, our principal shareholders or our affiliates. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial


-----

Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for
the accounts of their customers. Such investments and trading activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the
Group or the Group’s affiliates.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with the Group, including under

the Senior Secured Term Loans and notes issued by the Group or certain affiliates of the Group, and routinely hedge their
credit exposure to the Group consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers
and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to
clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes and may be lenders

under the New Senior Secured Term Loans. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates, have in the past acted as
joint global coordinator, joint lead arranger and/or joint bookrunner in relation to the Senior Secured Term Loans, a
portion of which will be repaid with the net proceeds of the Offering. Certain Initial Purchasers or their respective
affiliates also provide loans to certain affiliates of the Group and act as arrangers, bookrunners, technical bank and/or
agents under loan facilities of certain affiliates of the Group. Certain Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are
lenders under the Securitization Program and may also provide cash management, foreign currency exchange instruments
and hedging services to the Group or affiliates of the Group.

Affiliates of INEOS Limited purchased Notes issued on the Issue Date.

person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us and to review, and has received, all additional information

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are companies incorporated in England and Wales. Other Guarantors

are organized under the laws of Belgium, Germany, Jersey, Luxembourg, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland and the
United States, and future Guarantors may also be organized under the laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions. All of our directors
and executive officers and many of the directors and officers of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States.
Although the Issuer and each of the Guarantors have submitted to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United
States on our directors and executive officers and the directors and executive officers of the Guarantors or security
providers. In addition, as many of our and the Guarantors’ assets and the assets of our and their directors and executive
officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in
U.S. courts predicated on civil liability provisions of the Federal securities laws of the United States.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against us or a Guarantor, investors will need to enforce such judgment

in jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court judgments outside
the United States is described below for the countries in which any of our Guarantors or our Collateral is located, you
should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or
elsewhere outside the United States.

**Belgium**

The U.S. and Belgium do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court

judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, the enforcement in Belgium of a judgment obtained in any U.S.
Federal or State court will be subject to Belgian rules of civil procedure and will only be granted following formal
‘exequatur’ proceedings before a Belgian court in accordance with Articles 23 and 24 of the Belgian Code of Private
International Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de droit international privé).

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents must be

produced in court by the claimant seeking enforcement:

      - an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling all
conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

      - if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the originating
process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign law; and

      - any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable and has
been notified to the defendant.

However, the court will refuse enforcement in the circumstances described in Article 25 of the Belgian Code of

Private International Law and notably, if, among other things:

      - the consequences of the enforcement of the judgment would be manifestly contrary to Belgian public
policy;

      - the rights of defense were not respected;

      - the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets in such state
without any further connection with the litigation in such state;

      - without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the judgment is not final
or does not meet the requirements of authenticity pursuant to the laws of the State where the judgment was
rendered or the applicable federal rules;

      - if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has been sought
with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in accordance with Belgian
conflict of law rules;

      - the decision is in conflict with either a decision rendered in Belgium or a decision previously rendered in
another state that can be recognized in Belgium;

      - the claim was introduced before the courts of such state after a claim, which is still pending and relating to
the same matter and between the same parties, was introduced in a Belgian court;


-----

      - the Belgian courts have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to the claim; or

      - the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions in relation to
insolvency proceedings.

With regard to the enforcement by legal proceedings of any claim (including the exequatur of foreign court

decisions in Belgium), a registration tax of 3% (to be calculated on the total amount, which a debtor is ordered to pay) is
due, if the sum of money which the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court judgment, or by a foreign court judgment
that is either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium or (ii) rendered enforceable by a Belgian court,
exceeds EUR 12,500. The debtors are liable for the payment of the registration tax, in the proportion determined by the
decision ordering payment or liquidation or determining priority for creditors made or established against them. The
debtors are jointly and severally liable in the event that they are ordered to pay jointly and severally.

**Canada**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in the Canadian

province of Ontario is based upon advice provided to us by U.S. and Canadian legal advisors. Ontario does not currently
have a treaty with the United States of America or any state thereof providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not
predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognized or enforceable in Ontario. In
order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Ontario, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent
jurisdiction in Ontario (a “Canadian Court”). In such an action, the Canadian Court would not generally reinvestigate
the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible
to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and enforcement
of a U.S. judgment by a Canadian Court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

      - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to conflicts of laws principles
of Ontario;

      - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

      - the U.S. judgment not contravening public policy of Ontario;

      - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

      - the judgment not being contrary to an order made by the Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign
_Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada), or the Competition Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada) in_
respect of certain judgments referred to in these statutes or the Governor in Council under the United
_Nations Act (Canada) or the Special Economic Measures Act (Canada);_

      - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of principles of natural justice as
understood under the laws of Ontario;

      - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Canadian Court of Ontario in respect of the same
matter; and

      - the enforcement proceedings being commenced within the applicable limitation period in Ontario.

Subject to the foregoing, among other things, investors may be able to enforce in Ontario judgments in civil and

commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those
judgments will be recognized or enforceable in Ontario. In addition, it is questionable whether a Canadian Court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Ontario, instead of the United
States, and predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws.

**England**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England is based

upon advice provided to us by U.S. and English legal advisors. The United States and England currently do not have a
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil
and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United


-----

States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically
be recognized or enforceable in England. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England, proceedings must first
be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England. In such an action, an English court would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to the following) and it would usually be
possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it). Recognition and
enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the
following:

      - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English conflicts of laws
principles and rules of English private international law;

      - the U.S. judgment having not been given contrary to an applicable jurisdiction or arbitration clause or other
agreement for the settlement of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise
than by proceedings in a U.S. court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit);

      - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

      - the U.S. judgment not contravening English public policy or statute (including the Human Rights Act
1998);

      - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

      - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed
as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

      - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of natural or
substantial justice;

      - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English court, or another court whose judgment is
entitled to recognition in England and Wales, in respect of the same matter; and

      - the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within six years from the date of the U.S.
judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England judgments in civil and commercial matters

that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be
recognized or enforceable in England. In addition, it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction
and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England, instead of the United States, and predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**France**

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of

judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by
any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal or state
securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in
whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the
relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire). Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following
proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which
conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign
judgment):

      - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter in accordance with French
rules of international conflicts of jurisdiction (i.e., the dispute is clearly connected to the United States and
the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter);

      - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the
merits and to the procedure of the case;

      - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud; and


-----

      - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment which has become
effective in France and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of
the judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment would have res judicata and be

enforceable in France, even during the period to lodge an appeal against the civil first instance Court decision and during
potential appeal proceedings, unless its enforceability is suspended by Court decision until the end of such appeal
proceedings.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under

certain circumstances by French criminal law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of
July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to communication of documents and
information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which
could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or
administrative U.S. action. Similarly, European and French data protection rules (including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of
the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data
processing, data files and individual liberties, as amended from time to time) can limit under certain circumstances the
possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S.
action in a discovery context.

If an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the designated law (or part of it) if

its application contravenes French public policy. In an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. Federal or state
securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual)

can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts
(article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant
or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts and that the
foreign decision issued in such circumstances would not be recognized and enforced in France. However, according to
currently established case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction towards French nationals is no longer mandatory to the
extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has sufficient contacts with the dispute and
the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent, and does not prevent the recognition and enforcement of the decision of such
foreign court. In addition, the French and foreign nationals may respectively waive their rights to benefit from the
provisions of articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including implicitly, by way of conduct by voluntarily
appearing before the foreign court.

**Germany**

The following discussion with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Germany is based

upon advice provided to us by our German legal advisors.

The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and

enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for a payment rendered by
any court in the United States would not automatically be enforceable in Germany.

Notwithstanding the preceding, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the

United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would generally
be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a German court, and such German court generally will not
investigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of the U.S.
judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including all of the following:

      - the ability of the U.S. court to take jurisdiction of the case in accordance with the principles of jurisdictional
competence under German law;

      - the document introducing the proceedings having been duly made known to the defendant in a timely
manner that allowed for adequate defense;

      - the judgment not being contrary to (i) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German
court or (ii) any prior judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized
in Germany, and the procedure leading to the U.S. judgment is not in contradiction to any such prior
judgment;


-----

      - the effects of its recognition not being in conflict with material principles of German law, including,
without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of Germany (Grundrechte). In this context, it
should be noted that any component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive
damages or any other damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will
not be enforced in Germany, as they are regarded to be in conflict with material principles of German law;

      - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments being guaranteed; and

      - the judgment having become res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced.

Enforcement and foreclosure based on U.S. judgments may be sought against German defendants after having

received an enforcement decision from a competent German court in accordance with the above principles. Subject to the
foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in Germany in civil and commercial matters obtained from U.S.
federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be enforceable. In addition, it is
doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action predicated
solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Furthermore, in the past the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages has been denied by German

courts as incompatible with the substantial foundations of German law. A German court may reduce the amount of
damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual
loss.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to

the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on
common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the
production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner
may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pretrial discovery process exists under German law. If the
party in whose favor a final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may
submit to the German court the final judgement rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by
a federal or state court of the United States against the Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as
evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the
dispute and may render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**Jersey**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Jersey is based

upon advice provided to us by Jersey legal advisors. The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United
States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings
must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not
generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it
would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defense to it).
Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other
things) the following:

      - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflict of laws
principles;

      - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money (although there are circumstances where
non-money judgments can also be enforced);

      - the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

      - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

      - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed
as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the
United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);


-----

      - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice; and

      - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters

that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be
recognized or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and
impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely
upon U.S. Federal securities laws.

**Luxembourg**

The Issuer has been advised by Luxembourg counsel that the United States and Luxembourg are not currently

bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, except for arbitral awards rendered
in civil and commercial matters. According to such counsel, an enforceable judgment for the payment of monies rendered
by any U.S. Federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. securities laws,
would not directly be enforceable in Luxembourg. However, a party who received such favorable judgment in a U.S.
court may initiate enforcement proceedings via an action for exequatur (exequatur) in Luxembourg pursuant to the
provisions of articles 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg new code of civil procedure (nouveau code de procédure civile), by
requesting enforcement of the U.S. judgment by the District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) . The District Court will
authorize the enforcement in Luxembourg of the U.S. judgment if it is satisfied that all of the following conditions are
met:

      - the U.S. judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

      - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction, both according to its own national jurisdiction rules
and to the Luxembourg principles of conflicts of jurisdiction and in particular, Luxembourg courts had no
exclusive jurisdiction over the case at hand, to adjudicate the respective matter under applicable U.S.
Federal or state jurisdictions rules;

      - the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by
Luxembourg courts in accordance with Luxembourg conflict of laws rules;

      - the U.S. judgment does not contravene Luxembourg international public policy or overriding mandatory
provisions of Luxembourg law;

      - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

      - the principles of natural justice have been complied with and the U.S. judgment was granted following
proceedings where the defendant had the opportunity to appear and, if it appeared, to present a defense; and

      - the U.S. judgment was not granted pursuant to an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi
_luxembourgeoise)._

Luxembourg courts do currently not review the merits of New York judgments even though there is no statutory

prohibition of such review.

Under Luxembourg law, contractual provisions allowing the service of process against a party to a service agent

could be overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid serving of process against a party in
accordance with applicable laws at the domicile of the party.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Luxembourg judgments in civil and commercial

matters that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments
will be recognized or enforceable in Luxembourg. In addition, it is questionable whether a Luxembourg court would
accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Luxembourg instead of the United
States, and predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws.

**Norway**

A judgment against the Issuer or any Guarantor in the courts of a state which is not, under the terms of the

Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, a Contracting State (as defined
in the Lugano Convention) or a state with which Norway has entered into a convention on the mutual recognition and
enforcement of judgments, would not be recognized or enforceable in Norway as a matter of right unless the jurisdiction


-----

of such court has been specifically agreed between the parties in a civil matter in accordance with the Norwegian Civil
Procedure Act of June 17, 2005 No. 90 section 19-16 cfr. section 4-6 or the recognition and enforcement of such
judgments are otherwise accepted under Norwegian law. However, such judgments may be admissible as evidence in the
courts of law, executive or other public authorities of Norway and may in such capacity carry persuasive authority
depending on the merits of the judgment without a retrial on its merits. The foregoing could imply, inter alia, that
judgments by U.S. courts would not be recognized or enforceable in Norway as a matter of right. A judgment against an
Issuer or any Guarantor in the courts of a state which is, under the terms of the Lugano Convention on the Recognition of
Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters, a Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) or a state with
which Norway has entered into a convention on the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments, and judgments
rendered by a court whose jurisdiction have been expressly agreed to and accepted by the party, in writing and in a
particular civil matter, in accordance with the Norwegian Civil Procedure Act of June 17, 2005 No. 90, and such
judgments for which the recognition and enforcement is otherwise accepted under Norwegian law, would be recognized
and enforceable in Norway, but only insofar as such recognition and enforcement would not be in breach of mandatory
law or contrary to public policy in Norway. Only creditors of a claim may have active judicial standing in a Norwegian
court; therefore, a security agent or other representative of the creditors may seek enforcement of a claim but such claim
may have to be supported by the actual creditors of such claim.

**Scotland**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in Scotland is based

upon advice provided to us by U.S. and Scottish legal advisors. The United States and Scotland currently do not have a
treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil
and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any Federal or state court in the United
States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in Scotland. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Scotland,
proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Scotland. In such an action, a Scottish court
would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court and it would usually be
possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (subject to what is said below). Recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by a Scottish court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

      - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Scottish conflicts of laws
principles;

      - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the
court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

      - the U.S. judgment not contravening Scottish public policy;

      - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

      - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed
as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980, or the judgment not being on a claim for contribution in respect of
damages awarded by a judgment based on a rule of law specified under Section 5 of the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980;

      - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud;

      - the U.S. judgment resulted from proceedings which displayed a substantial degree of unfairness or
irregularity against the parties to the action, or otherwise contrary to the principles of natural justice;

      - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Scottish court between the same parties, or a prior
final judgment of another court having jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable in Scotland;

      - the U.S. judgment is affected by Section 32 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 where (1) the
bringing of the proceedings was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be
settled otherwise than by proceedings in the courts of that country, (2) those proceedings were not brought
in that court by or with the agreement of the person against whom the judgment was given and (3) that
person did not counterclaim in the proceedings or otherwise submit to the jurisdiction of the court;

      - there not having been an order made and remaining effective under Section 9 of the 1933 Act applying that
section to judgments of the original court;


-----

      - the U.S. judgment having not been based on foreign measures which the Secretary of State specifies under
Section 1 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 as regulating and controlling international trade
and which, in so far as they apply to persons carrying on business in the United Kingdom, are damaging or
threaten to damage the trading interests of the United Kingdom; and

      - the claim not having become barred under the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973, as amended
by the Prescription (Scotland) Act 2018, or may be or become subject to defenses of retention,
compensation, set-off or counterclaim.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Scotland judgments in civil and commercial

matters that have been obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments
will be recognized or enforceable in Scotland. In addition, it is questionable whether a Scottish court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Scotland, instead of the United States, and
predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws.

**Singapore**

Judgments by courts in the United States of America are not directly enforceable in Singapore as if they were

judgments of the Singapore courts. However, a final and conclusive judgment on the merits properly obtained against (as
the case may be) us or a Guarantor in any competent court of the United States of America for a fixed sum of money
payable by (as the case may be) us or such Guarantor in respect of any legal suit or proceeding and which could be
enforced by execution against (as the case may be) us or such Guarantor in the jurisdiction of the relevant court and has
not been stayed or satisfied in whole may be sued on in Singapore as a debt due from (as the case may be) us or such
Guarantor if:

      - the relevant court had jurisdiction over (as the case may be) us or such Guarantor in that (as the case may
be) we were or such Guarantor was, at the time such proceeding was instituted, resident in the jurisdiction
in which such proceeding had been commenced or had submitted to the jurisdiction of the relevant court;

      - that judgment was not obtained by fraud;

      - that judgment does not amount to judgment on a matter previously determined by a Singapore court and
does not conflict with a judgment on the same matter given by any other court that is enforceable in
Singapore;

      - the enforcement of that judgment will not be contrary to public policy of Singapore;

      - that judgment had not been obtained in contravention of the principles of natural justice; and

      - that judgment of the relevant court did not include the payment of taxes, or a fine or penalty.

**Switzerland**

We have been advised by our Swiss counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability of U.S. judgments in

Switzerland, or the applicability of U.S. Federal or state securities laws in an action brought before a Swiss court. The
United States and Switzerland currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S.
Federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. Federal or state securities laws, would not
automatically be enforceable in Switzerland. A final judgment by a U.S. Federal or state court, however, may be
recognized in Switzerland in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceeding set
forth by the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht) and the
Swiss Federal Act on Civil Procedure (Schweizerische Zivilprozessordnung) and the Swiss Debt Enforcement and
Bankruptcy Act (Bundesgesetz über Schuldbetreibung und Konkurs). In such an action, a Swiss court generally would
not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S.
judgment by a Swiss court would be conditional upon a number of conditions including those set out in articles 25 et
_seqq. of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das international Privatrecht), which_
include amongst others:

      - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings from a Swiss perspective as defined in
the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale Privatrecht);

      - the judgment being final under U.S. Federal or state law, and no ordinary legal remedy being available
against such judgment;


-----

      - the parties having been duly summoned, under the law of their place of residence or under the law of their
habitual residence, or they having proceeded to the merits without any reserves;

      - the original proceeding not having been conducted under a violation of material principles of Swiss civil
procedure law, in particular, the right to be heard;

      - the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court not being consistent with a matter
(Verfahren) pending before a Swiss court, provided such Swiss matter was pending before a Swiss court
prior to the U.S. court entered its proceedings; and

      - the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court not being manifestly incompatible with Swiss public
policy (schweizerischer Ordre public).

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial

matters obtained from U.S. Federal or state courts in Switzerland. We cannot, however, assure you that any attempts to
enforce judgments in Switzerland will be successful; in particular, it is uncertain whether a Swiss court would recognize
U.S. jurisdiction if the defendant did not enter an appearance before a U.S. court during the substantive proceedings in
the sense of article 6 of the Swiss Federal Act on International Private Law (Bundesgesetz über das internationale
_Privatrecht). Furthermore, it is probable that a Swiss court, if substantive proceedings were commenced in Switzerland,_
would not apply U.S. Federal or state securities laws. In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages
awards might be denied by Swiss courts as incompatible with Swiss public policy (schweizerischer Ordre public).
Alternatively, a Swiss court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to
the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Swiss civil procedure differs substantially
from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to the production of evidence, for example, U.S. Federal
and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process
by which parties to the proceedings may, prior to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties
and the depositions of witnesses. Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. In
Switzerland, in principle, no such pre-trial discovery process exists. A Swiss court would generally decide on the basis of
evidence provided by the parties and in accordance with the applicable rules on the burden of proof.

**INEOS GROUP HOLDINGS S.A.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**1. BASIS OF PREPARATION**

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include INEOS Group
Holdings S.A. and all its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). Intra-group transactions and
balances have been eliminated on consolidation. The financial and operating results for any period less than
a year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year. The Group does
not experience any significant seasonality in its operating results.

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the
historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value, principally
derivative financial instruments and the assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension
schemes measured at fair value and using the projected unit credit method, respectively.

These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in euro, which
is the functional currency of the majority of operations of the Group and is consistent with the audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The significant judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty applicable to the preparation
of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as those described
within the Group’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. In each case,
judgements have been applied consistently and estimates made using a consistent methodology, with inputs
and assumptions updated to reflect the Group’s latest forecasts and prevailing market conditions at the
balance sheet date as appropriate.

The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group are
unaudited.

The Group continues to implement contingency plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
primary objective of maintaining the safety of personnel and the reliable operation of the Group’s plants.

The chemical industry is deemed as essential, critical infrastructure by governments across the
world. Throughout the pandemic all of the Group’s plants have continued to operate fully and supply
chains have operated without significant disruption. Protecting employees and ensuring that they remain
healthy has been the first priority of the Group. All plants have sufficient resources and have implemented
measures to ensure that this remains the case throughout the pandemic.

The Group does not have operations in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. During 2021 and 2022 revenue
generated in these countries was not material to the Group. The Group is not currently experiencing any
material disruption to its operations and does not foresee any direct impact as a result of the conflict, but will
continue to monitor the evolving situation closely.

Whilst there is still uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption on the energy
market resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, the Directors have undertaken a rigorous assessment of the
potential impact on demand for the Group’s products and services and the impact on margins for the next
12 months and the Directors do not expect a material impact on the Group’s ability to operate as a going
concern.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its cash generation from
Group operations. The Group held cash balances of €2,731.7 million at September 30, 2022 and interestbearing loans and borrowings (net of debt issue costs) of €8,038.2 million at September 30, 2022. The
Directors have considered the Group’s projected future cash flows and working capital requirements and are
confident that the Company has sufficient cashflows to meet its working capital requirements for the next
twelve months from the date of this report. In particular, the Directors have stress tested the forecasts through
taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance on the impact on EBITDA, cash
flow and debt. The stress tests show that the Group will still have sufficient cash flow to meet all of its
obligations as they fall due within the next 12 months from the date of this report.

On the basis of this assessment together with net assets of €5,777.8 million as at September 30,
2022 and the Group’s ability to meet working capital requirements through its external financing facilities,
along with access to cash generated by its subsidiaries, the Directors have concluded that the Group can
operate within its current facilities without the need to obtain new ones for a period of at least 12 months
from the date of this report and have therefore prepared these financial statements on a going concern basis.

**4. SHARE OF PROFIT/(LOSS) OF ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES USING THE EQUITY**
**ACCOUNTING METHOD**

Share of profit/(loss)of associates and joint ventures was a profit of €134.2 million in the nine
month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to a loss of €19.6 million for the same period in
2021. The share of profit from associates and joint ventures primarily reflected the Group’s share of the
results of the Refining joint venture with PetroChina as margins in the European refining market have
strengthened in the nine month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine month period
ended September 30, 2021, although this was partially offset by lower inventory holding gains in the nine
month period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021.

The exchange movements reflect net foreign exchange gains or losses associated with short term
intra group funding.

**6. TAXATION**

Taxes on income in the interim periods are accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to
the expected total annual profit or loss.

After adjusting for the results from the share of associates and joint ventures, the effective tax rate
of approximately 18% reflects the anticipated tax rate for the Group for the full year. After adjusting for the
results from the share of associates and joint ventures, the underlying effective tax rate in the same period
in 2021 was approximately 16%, which reflected the anticipated tax rate for the full year. The higher anticipated
tax rate for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the same periods
in 2021 reflected increased profitability in countries with higher corporate tax rates.

**7. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

In the nine month period ended September 30, 2022, the Group spent €674.9 million (nine month
period ended September 30, 2021: €503.7 million) on property, plant and equipment. The main capital

**7. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued)**

expenditures in the O&P North America segment related to turnaround expenditure. The main capital
expenditures in the O&P Europe segment related to the completion of the cogeneration project at the Koln,
Germany site, together with expenditure on a scheduled cracker turnaround at the Rafnes, Norway site.
The main expenditure in the Chemical Intermediates segment was further growth expenditure by the Phenol
business on the new cumene unit project at Marl. There was further growth expenditure by the Oligomers
business on the LAO and PAO platforms at Chocolate Bayou, USA. In Nitriles, there was expenditure on the
new port facility at the Green Lake site. The remaining capital expenditure related primarily to sustenance
expenditure.

**8. DIVIDENDS**

In the nine month period ended September 30, 2022, the Group paid an interim dividend of
€216.26 per ordinary share (nine month period ended June 30, 2021: €324.39) from retained profits. With
924,803 ordinary shares, this represented total interim dividends paid of €200.0 million (nine month period
ended September 30, 2021: €300.0 million).

**9. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

In the nine month period ended September 30, 2022, the Group has recognised other comprehensive
income of €367.7 million (nine month period ended September 30, 2021: €152.0 million) following the
remeasurement of the Group’s post employment benefit obligations, net of tax. The gain is primarily due
to an increase in the discount and inflation rate assumptions used to remeasure the defined benefit obligations
of the Germany pension schemes, which were 3.75% and 2.25% respectively as at September 30, 2022 as
compared to 1.25% and 2.00% respectively as at December 31, 2021.

**_Senior Secured Term Loans_**

The Group has outstanding borrowings under a senior credit facilities agreement dated April 27,
2012 (as amended and restated) which consist of euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans (referred to
as the ‘Senior Secured Term Loans’ or ‘Term Loans’).

In November 2021 the Group raised €1.1 billion of additional Senior Secured Term Loans which
were used to fully redeem the outstanding Senior Notes due 2024. The additional Senior Secured Term
Loans mature on November 8, 2028 and consisted of $845 million of US dollar denominated Term Loans
and €350 million of euro denominated Term Loans. In October 2020 the Group issued new euro denominated
Senior Secured Term Loans of €375 million which mature on October 27, 2027. In addition to these new
Senior Secured Term Loans the Group has euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing on
March 31, 2024.

The Senior Secured Term Loans outstanding at September 30, 2022 before issue costs were
€5,160.4 million (December 31, 2021: €4,851.1 million) of which €50.0 million (December 31, 2021:
€44.7 million) is due within one year. The total amounts outstanding on the Euro denominated Term Loans
were €2,680.5 million (December 31, 2021: €2,698.9 million) and the US dollar denominated Term Loans
were €2,479.9 million (December 31, 2021: €2,152.2 million).

The Term Loans are to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments, in aggregate annual amounts
equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans up to the final maturity date, apart from
the euro denominated Term Loans maturing November 2028 which have no repayments until maturity. The
$845 million US dollar denominated Term Loans and €350 million of euro denominated Term Loans
issued in November 2021 mature on November 8, 2028, whilst the €375 million euro denominated Senior
Secured Term Loans issued in October 2020 mature on October 27, 2027 with the remaining Term Loans
maturing on March 31, 2024.

The outstanding Term Loans denominated in US dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
USD LIBOR (with the $845 million US dollar denominated Term Loans issued in November 2021 being
subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus the applicable margin. All of the Term Loans denominated in
euros bear interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus the
applicable margin.

As at September 30, 2022 the applicable margin for the euro denominated Term Loans and the US
dollar denominated Term Loans maturing March 2024 was 2.00%, for the euro denominated Term Loans
maturing October 2027 and November 2028 it was 2.75% and for the US dollar denominated Term Loans
maturing November 2028 it was 2.50%.

The Senior Secured Term Loans rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes due May 2026,
Senior Secured Notes due March 2026, Senior Secured Notes due 2025 and the Schuldschein Loan. The
Term Loans are guaranteed by INEOS Group Holdings S.A., INEOS Holdings Limited and certain of their
subsidiaries on a senior secured basis. The Term Loans and the guarantees are secured by first ranking
liens on the same assets (subject to certain exceptions) that secure INEOS Holdings Limited’s obligations
under the senior secured notes.

**11. BORROWINGS (continued)**

The Term Loans have numerous customary operating and financial incurrence covenants all of
which have been complied with during the period, including covenants relating to, among other things,
limitations on indebtedness, ability to give guarantees, creation of security interests, making acquisitions
and investments, disposing of assets and paying dividends. The Term Loans have no financial maintenance
covenants.

The Senior Secured Term Loans are stated net of debt issue costs of €19.4 million (December 31,
2021: €21.5 million). These costs are allocated to the profit and loss account over the term of the Term
Loans.

In November 2022 the Group extended its maturity profile by issuing new Senior Secured Term
Loans maturing in November 2027, denominated in euros (€800 million) and US dollars ($1.2 billion). The
new Term Loans were used to partially redeem the euro and US dollar denominated Term Loans maturing
on March 31, 2024 as well as increasing the liquidity of the Group. The new Term Loans denominated in
euros bear interest at a rate per annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus
the applicable margin. The Term Loans denominated in US dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to SOFR plus a credit support adjustment and an applicable margin.

**_Senior Secured Notes due 2025_**

In November 2017 the Group issued €550 million of Senior Secured Notes due 2025. The proceeds
from the new Notes were used to partially repay the Senior Secured Term Loans. The Senior Secured Notes
due 2025 are listed on the Euro MTF—Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Senior Secured Notes due
2025 bear interest at 2.125% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of
each year. Unless previously redeemed as noted below, the Senior Secured Notes due 2025 will be redeemed
by the Group at their principal amount on November 15, 2025.

**12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

The carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value of trade receivables and payables.

**INEOS GROUP HOLDINGS S.A.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

The financial assets/liabilities categorised as Fair Value through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) presented
in Level 2 contains commodity and interest rate swap derivatives. The financial assets/liabilities categorised
as Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) presented in Level 3 contains equity
securities.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels, determined in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, have been defined as
follows:

     - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

     - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

     - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

The commodity derivatives are fair valued using rates in a quoted market. There have been no
transfers between levels during the nine month period ended September 30, 2022 (2021: no transfers
between levels).

**_Credit risk_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, deposits with financial institutions and derivatives.

Group Treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimize the likelihood that the
Group will experience financial loss due to counterparty failure. The Group has established a credit policy
under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard
payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are adjusted accordingly. The Group’s review
includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established
for each customer, which represent the maximum open amount without requiring approval.

Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group
only on a prepayment basis.

**_Liquidity risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have


-----

**INEOS GROUP HOLDINGS S.A.**

**NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by
the fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short,
medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.

The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary
company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget.

The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and
monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at
bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a
monthly basis the level of headroom on existing facilities is reported and forecast forward until the end of
the financial period.

**_Currency risk_**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures. A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S.
dollar and the euro. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and
most other costs are denominated in euro and sterling. In the U.S. petrochemical and specialty chemicals
businesses, product prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Group has established a currency risk policy under which material currency flows are analysed
and if management considers it needed the risks are mitigated. The Group looks at transactional and
translation currency risks.

**_Commodity price risk_**

The Group and its Refining joint venture are exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations
in raw material prices and sales of products. The raw material exposures result primarily from the price of
crude oil and base chemicals linked to the price of crude. The sales price exposures are primarily related to
petrochemicals where prices are in general linked to the market price of crude oil.

The Group enters into contracts to supply or acquire physical volumes of commodities at future
dates during the normal course of business that may be considered derivative contracts. Where such
contracts exist and are in respect of the normal purchase or sale of products to fulfil the Group’s
requirements, the own use exemption from derivative accounting is applied.

The Group manages commodity price exposures through trading refined products and chemical
feedstock and using commodity swaps, options and futures as a means of managing price and timing risks.
As at September 30, 2022 there was a net mark to market derivative asset in respect of commodity contracts
of €35.1 million entered into by the Group to manage such risk (December 31, 2021: net derivative asset of
€20.0 million).

The Group operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those
relating to the default of counterparties, are minimised.

**_Net investment hedges_**

The Group has Sterling financial liabilities in respect of the Securitisation Facility that are
designated net investment hedges and Sterling operations in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9.

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2022 gains net of tax of €875.5 million were taken
directly to reserves and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period then ended
(2021: €387.7 million). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement for the nine month
period ended September 30, 2022 (2021: €nil).

**13. CONTINGENCIES**

The Group is subject to various proceedings instituted by governmental authorities arising under
the provisions of applicable laws or regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment

In December 2022 the Group repaid in full the €141 million floating rate Schuldschein loan facility
which was originally due to mature in March 2024.

In July 2022 the Group announced the acquisition of a 50% stake in Shanghai SECCO
Petrochemical Company Limited and paid approximately RMB 3.2 billion (€449.8 million) to Sinopec as a
deposit. During December 2022 the Group issued a 3.5 year facility denominated in US dollars
($525 million) and RMB (RMB 1.1 billion) which will be used to complete the acquisition before the end of
the year. The new facility denominated in US dollars bears interest at a rate per annum equal to
compounded SOFR plus a margin of 3.75%. The new facility denominated in RMB bears interest at a rate
per annum equal to RMB HIBOR plus a margin of 4.5%.

In December 2022 the Group announced the proposed acquisition of the 50% share in the Tianjin
Nangang Ethylene Project, subject to regulatory approval. The majority of the construction cost is expected
to be funded through project financing and, as a result, the approximate purchase price of the equity is
expected to be RMB 5 billion (€0.7 billion), to be paid on completion of the project. The complex includes
the first of the 500ktpa HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plants previously announced by the Group
and Sinopec in July 2022.

INEOS Group Holdings S.A.

L-1930 Luxembourg

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of INEOS Group Holdings S.A. and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2021, and
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated
statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes
to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2021, and its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 on the audit profession (Law
of July 23, 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of July 23,
2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the “Responsibilities of
the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our
report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the management report but does not
include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in
this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial**
**Statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Responsibilities of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a
report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and
with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

     - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.

     - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

    - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

    - Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the
“réviseur d’entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to
cease to continue as a going concern.

     - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.


-----

     - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Overview**

INEOS Group Holdings S.A. (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the
form of a société anonyme under the laws of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office
at 62 Avenue de la Liberté L-1930, Luxembourg, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. The nature of the
operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are the manufacture and sale of a
range of petrochemical products used in a variety of applications.

**Basis of accounting**

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as the “Group”) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and joint ventures.

The Group continues to implement contingency plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
primary objective of maintaining the safety of personnel and the reliable operation of the Group’s plants.

The chemical industry is deemed as essential, critical infrastructure by governments across the
world. Throughout the pandemic all of the Group’s plants have continued to operate fully and supply
chains have operated without significant disruption. Protecting employees and ensuring that they remain
healthy has been the first priority of the Group. All plants have sufficient resources and have implemented
measures to ensure that this remains the case throughout the pandemic.

Whilst there is still uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic the Directors have undertaken a
rigorous assessment of the potential impact of COVID-19 on demand for the Group’s products and
services and the impact on margins for the next 12 months.

The Group meets its day to day working capital requirements through its cash generation from
Group operations. The Group held cash balances of €2,106.1 million at 31 December 2021 (2020:
€1,342.2 million, 2019: €982.9 million) and interest-bearing loans and borrowings of €7,739.3 million at
31 December 2021 (2020: €7,581.8 million, 2019: €6,852.8 million). The Directors have considered the
Group’s projected future cash flows and working capital requirements and are confident that the Company
has sufficient cashflows to meet its working capital requirements for the next twelve months from the date
of signing the financial statements. In particular, the Directors have stress tested the forecasts through taking
account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance on the impact on EBITDA, cash flow and
debt. The stress tests show that the Group will still have sufficient cash flow to meet all of its obligations as
they fall due within the next 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements.

On the basis of this assessment together with net assets of €3,353.0 million as at 31 December 2021
(2020: €1,461.6 million, 2019: €1,456.4 million) and the Group’s ability to meet working capital requirements
through its external financing facilities, along with access to cash generated by its subsidiaries, the Directors
have concluded that the Group can operate within its current facilities without the need to obtain new
ones for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report and have therefore prepared these financial
statements on a going concern basis.

The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union in response
to the IAS regulation (EC 1606/2002) effective as of 31 December 2021 and have been approved for issuance
by the Board of Directors on 18 March 2022.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial
instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or fair value through
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) which are stated at their fair value.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Functional and presentation currency**

These Group financial statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the
majority of operations, with other significant currencies being USD and Sterling. The Group’s primary
products are sold in an international commodities market which is priced and invoiced primarily in euros.

All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest €0.1 million.

**Changes in accounting policies**

The Group financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies that are consistent
with those of the previous financial year. The Group has adopted the following amendments to accounting
standards for the first time in 2021, with effect from 1 January 2021, although there has been no material
effect on the Group’s financial statements:

    - Amendment to IFRS 16—COVID-19—Related Rent Concessions—beyond 30 June 2021
(effective date 1 April 2021). The amendment introduces an optional practical expedient that
simplifies how a lessee accounts for rent concessions that are a direct consequence of COVID-19.

    - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—
Phase 2 has been adopted and has been applied retrospectively. The amendments introduce a
practical expedient relating to modifications of financial instruments and lease contracts and
specific hedge accounting requirements which is triggered by a replacement of a benchmark
interest rate in a contract with a new alternative benchmark rate. The details of the accounting
policies are disclosed in Note 1—“Derivative financial instruments and hedging.”

**Basis of consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The
Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations, except acquisitions
under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. The consideration transferred for the
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination of a subsidiary or joint venture is achieved in stages, the acquisition
date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair
value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit
or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be
an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 in the profit or loss. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are
also recorded in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The
fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest
as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of
the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to profit or loss.

_Special purpose entities (“SPE”)_

An SPE is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the
Group and the SPE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it controls the SPE. The Group has
established an SPE, INEOS Finance Ireland Limited, for a debt securitisation programme. The Group does
not have any direct or indirect shareholdings in this SPE. INEOS Finance Ireland Limited is controlled by
the Group as it was established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers of
the SPE’s management that result in the Group receiving the majority of the benefits related to the SPE’s
operations and net assets, being exposed to the majority of risks arising from the SPE’s activities, and
retaining the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPE and its assets. INEOS Finance
Ireland Limited is therefore regarded as an SPE and has been consolidated in these financial statements.

_Associates_

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of
the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes
goodwill identified on acquisition. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its
share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive
income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share
of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the
investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the
amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates’ in the income statement.

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and
its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s
interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

_Joint arrangements_

The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint
arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights
and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined
them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and
movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or
exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part
of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the
extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**Foreign exchange**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised
in the consolidated income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial
liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges,
which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign exchange are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value
are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was
determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency, euros, at foreign exchange
rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The Group applies an average rate for the year where this
rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences
arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. They are
recycled into the consolidated income statement upon disposal.

Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign
operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation
reserve. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of a borrowing designated as a hedge of
a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income (OCI), in the
translation reserve, to the extent that the hedge is effective. When the hedged part of a net investment is
disposed of, the associated cumulative amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to
the profit or loss on disposal.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet
the following two conditions:

(a) They include no contractual obligation upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial
assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is
either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its
own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial
liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts
presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude
amounts in relation to those shares.

**Non-derivative financial instruments**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and
other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition they are tested for
classification as per IFRS 9. If the trade receivables satisfy the criteria for cash flow characteristics test and
business model test as per IFRS 9, then they are recognised at amortised cost. If they do not qualify for
being recognised at amortised cost they are recognised at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value
through other comprehensive income.

_Trade and other payables_

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Investments in debt securities are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following
conditions and are not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income only if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

For investment in equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to
present subsequent changes to fair value in other comprehensive income. The Group makes this election on
an investment-by-investment basis.

All other financial assets, including derivatives, are classified as measured at fair value through
profit and loss. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised
directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing,
interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Where no reliable
measurement of fair value is available, investments are stated at historic acquisition cost.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash balances and call deposits.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_

Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

_Debt restructuring_

The Group derecognises financial liabilities in accordance with the provisions in IFRS 9. When
debt is modified, the Group analyses the modifications from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective
to determine if the modifications are substantial and meet the IFRS requirements for de-recognition, in
which case the debt is treated as extinguished. All fees paid in connection with a debt extinguishment are
expensed immediately. When a modification is accounted for as a non-substantial modification, associated
fees incurred are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the liability and amortised using the
original effective interest rate.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging**

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on subsequent
re- measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as finance
income or expense. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

**Hedge of net investment of foreign operation**

The Group applied hedge accounting to foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation
of a foreign currency loan where the loan is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
in accordance with IFRS 9.

Most commonly this means that exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign currency
loans designated as a net investment hedge are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to the statement of
comprehensive income when the foreign operation is sold.

When a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging
instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses
is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of the
changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is
recognised immediately in the income statement. The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to the income
statement as a reclassification adjustment on disposal of the foreign operation.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may
include the cost of materials, labour and other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working
condition for their intended use. Cost may also include the cost of dismantling and removing items and
restoring the site on which they are located.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences
from the date an asset is brought into service. Land and assets in the course of construction are not
depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

       - Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 40 years

     - Plant and equipment and fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 40 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where an indicator of
impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s
fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the
consolidated income statement in the period in which the item is derecognised.

**Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the Acquisition method, except
acquisitions under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. Goodwill represents amounts
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Acquisitions under common control are accounted for at book value. The difference in the book
value of the assets acquired and consideration paid is recognised in a distributable merger reserve.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of
cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. The cash generating units
within the Group are predominately business units. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
statement.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property
rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and license fees.

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. The initial cost is
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of other consideration given to acquire the assets. An intangible

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is
separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

      - Customer relationships. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 12 years

      - Intellectual property rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 15 years

      - Non-compete agreements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . life of the agreement

      - Licenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 15 years

These intangible assets are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Useful lives are examined
on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

**Research and development**

Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense
as incurred.

Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Group intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan
or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Where
regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is recognised in
the income statement. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense
as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less
accumulated impairment losses.

**Impairment of financial assets**

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group applies the simplified approach when providing for expected credit losses prescribed by
IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and contract assets. This approach requires the Group to recognise the
lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables taking in consideration historical as well as forwardlooking information.

Where the Group has assessed the probability of default of a financial asset to be low, the loss
allowance is considered immaterial.

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the
financial assets classified at amortised cost at each balance sheet date and adjusts the allowance accordingly.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Impairment of equity securities classified as FVOCI are not tested for impairment under IFRS 9.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as FVOCI increases and the increase can be objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the consolidated income statement,
the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Impairment of non-financial assets excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax
assets are assessed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment.

For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets
that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the end of the reporting period.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount
of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups of assets.

_Calculation of recoverable amount_

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

_Reversals of impairment_

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.

In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the
impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in first-out or average cost method, and
net realisable value which is defined as the estimated selling price less the estimated cost of completion and
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories,
production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads
based on normal operating capacity. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where
appropriate.

Items owned by the Group that are held on consignment at another entity’s premises are included
as part of the Group’s inventory.

**Commodities**

Contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of nonfinancial items in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own-use
contracts) are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments, but rather as executory contracts.

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**IFRS 16 Leases**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for
a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

**_Group as a lessee_**

_Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of
right- of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized and lease payments made at or before
the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease
incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying
asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group
will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the
underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition,
the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit
in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate (initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date), amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees less any lease incentives
receivable. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group
exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate
are expensed in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on
the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments a change in the
assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset,
a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the
Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way and there has been no change in the scope of the
lease, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded
in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to all leases that have a lease term
of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. The Group also


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of assets that are valued below
€10,000. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Employee benefits**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans and funded and unfunded defined
benefit pension schemes. The Group also provides unfunded early retirement benefits, long service awards
and an incentive plan for certain employees.

The Group provides health care insurance to eligible retired employees and their dependants,
primarily in the United States.

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the
consolidated income statement as incurred.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The liability discount rate is
the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and that have
maturity dates approximating to the terms of, the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

When the benefits of a plan are amended or curtailed, the portion of the increased or decreased
benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense immediately in the consolidated
income statement.

Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the
present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The pension scheme surplus (to the extent that it is recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full.

The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split between:

     - cost of sales and administrative expenses,

     - net finance costs and,

    - in net expense recognised directly in equity, the remeasurements of post employment benefit
obligations.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term
cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an


-----

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Revenue**

Revenue represents the invoiced value of products and services sold or services provided to third
parties net of sales discounts, value added taxes and duties. Contracts for goods and services are analysed
to determine the distinct performance obligations against which revenue should be recognised. The amount
to be recognised is determined from the standalone selling prices for goods and services, allocated to the
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring a promised good or service to a customer.

The pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and arrangements)
or is linked by a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional amount (formula
contracts). Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are dispatched or delivered
depending on the relevant delivery terms and point at which the control of the good or service is transferred
to the customer.

Services provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other
chemical companies with facilities on our sites and services under tolling arrangements. Under tolling
arrangements, customers pay for or provide raw materials to be converted into certain specified products,
for which the Group charges a toll fee. The Group only recognises toll fee as revenue earned under such
arrangements upon shipment of the converted product to the customer as this is the point at which the
control of the service is transferred to the buyer. For all other services, revenue is recognised at a point in
time. There are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time.

**Government grants**

Government grants are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income. This income is
amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the tangible fixed asset to which it relates or the
life of the related project.

**Finance income and expenses**

Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the consolidated income statement as it
accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated income
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign exchange gains and losses
are reported on a gross basis.

Finance costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on leases, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, net fair value losses on derivatives, net interest on employee benefit liabilities and foreign
exchange losses that are recognised in the consolidated income statement (see foreign exchange accounting
policy).

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and from related party loans, net
fair value gains on derivatives and foreign exchange gains.

**Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the
consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination;
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at
the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if it is possible that there is a
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets because they relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**Segmental analysis**

The Group determines its operating segments in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief operating decision-makers are responsible for
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The chief operating decisionmakers are the members of the Executive Committee of the ultimate parent undertaking, INEOS Limited.

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with
any of the Group’s other components and for which discrete financial information is available. An operating
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision-makers to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.

The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is based on business segments. The business
segments are determined based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and the
aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8.

Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-makers include items directly
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Segment capital expenditure is the total payments made during the period to acquire property,
plant and equipment other than as acquired through business combinations.

**Emission trading scheme**

The Group participates in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Scheme encourages companies
to reduce carbon emissions by offering financial incentives if they achieve their annual reduction targets. If
a company reduces emissions beyond their target then the surplus may be traded in the form of emissions
permits.

The incentive money due from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is recognised in the consolidated
income statement once the reduction targets have been met. The emissions permits allocated under the
Scheme are at nil cost. The Group recognises the revenue from such permits upon their sale to third parties.

The Group accrues for emissions produced. The accrual is measured at the carrying amount of the
emission rights held (nil if granted, otherwise at cost) or, in the case of a shortfall, at the current fair value
of the emission rights needed.

**Exceptional items**

In order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating
performance of the Group’s ongoing business it separately identifies those profits and losses which because
of their size or nature, are outside the normal course of business so are expected to be non-recurring.
This may include the disposal of businesses, the impairment of non-current assets, the cost of restructuring
acquired or existing businesses, site closures and demolition costs, the impact of one off events such as
legal settlements or finance costs relating to call premia and write-off of unamortised debt issue costs
following substantial modification or redemption of debt as exceptional items.

**Accounting standards not applied**

A number of new standards and amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 January 2022 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or
amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

The impact of their adoption is being assessed and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application. The new standards and amendments are as
follows:

    - Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective date
1 January 2022).

    - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS 3 (effective date
1 January 2022).

    - Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use
(effective date 1 January 2022).

    - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (effective date 1 January 2022).

    - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as
Current or Non-current (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 12: Income taxes—deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from
a single transaction (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2:
Disclosure of Accounting Policies (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 8: Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective date 1 January 2023).

**2. OPERATING SEGMENTS**

The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the business units for which
information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group has three reportable
segments, as described below.

The Group’s Olefins and Polymers business units produce olefins and related products and a broad
range of polymers. The Group’s olefins businesses are focused on ethylene and propylene, which are the
two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. These olefins are primarily used
as feedstock for the Group’s polymers business. In addition, the Group sells olefins to third party customers
for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including plastics, rubber and fibre.

    - O&P North America segment—In North America, the Group’s olefins and polymers business
comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas.

    - O&P Europe segment—In Europe, the Group owns and operates two major cracker complexes,
in Köln, Germany and Rafnes, Norway. This includes polymers and derivatives units.

**2. OPERATING SEGMENTS (continued)**

    - Chemical Intermediates—This reportable segment is the aggregation, in compliance with
IFRS 8, of a number of different business units with similar economic and other characteristics.
Chemical Intermediates are high-value added chemical products used as key components in a
variety of consumer and industrial products. The Group’s chemical intermediates businesses are
exposed to similar key commodities, namely oil and gas. They produce a range of products
including phenol, alpha olefins, solvents, industrial chemicals and nitriles. The Chemical
Intermediates processes are similar in that they are all capital intensive and based upon processing
and mixing chemical raw materials to produce chemical products for the next stage along the
value chain. The Chemical Intermediates products are distributed on a business-to-business basis
across the world. This is performed using similar conventional methods of pipeline, truck, rail
or ship container depending on the customer location and size of the order. The Chemical
Intermediates customer base is similar in that the customers are generally manufacturers of
consumer and industrial products in developed markets and mature industrial economies.

The accounting policies of all of the reportable segments are as described in Note 1.

Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included in the following
tables. Performance is measured based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and
exceptional items, measured under IFRS (“Segment EBITDA”). A reconciliation to IFRS profit before tax is
presented in the following tables. Segment EBITDA is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to
other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length
basis. Information regarding segments reviewed by management includes management accounts comprising
the profit or loss, cash flows and other financial and non-financial information used to manage the
business.

Adjustments in the following tables comprise the following items:

    - Elimination of inter-segmental transactions and balances; and

     - The Group’s share of (loss)/profit in respect of the Refining joint venture.

In presenting information on the basis of geographic analysis of segments, segment revenue is
based on the geographical location of customers and geographical locations from which the Group derives
revenues.

Revenues from external customers for each product and service or each group of similar products
and services and a geographic analysis of segment assets are not presented as the necessary information is
not available and the Directors are of the opinion that the cost to develop it would be excessive.

All businesses within the Group typically sell individual cargos based on agreed price with delivery
from the plant or at the customer premise. As such, the revenue is recognised as title passes, at a point in
time, and there are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time. No significant
contract balances arise. No costs to obtain or fulfil contracts are incurred, and therefore no related assets
arise.

**3. ACQUISITIONS**

**_Acquisition of businesses in the current year_**

**Charter Plastics**

On December 31, 2021, the Group acquired the assets of Charter Plastics in Titusville, USA which
manufactures high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe products. The total cash consideration for the assets
was $64.5 million (€56.4 million). This acquisition forms part of the O&P North America reporting segment
and is defined as a business under IFRS 3.

**Difference between consideration and provisional net assets acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **18.1**

The fair values disclosed are provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the preparation
of these financial statements so further work may be required to confirm final fair values. The finalisation
of the work to determine the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will be completed within
12 months of the acquisition date.

The difference between consideration and net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill
within intangible assets (see Note 11) and has arisen because of the ability of the Group to create product
and market diversification in the Northeast region of the USA. The goodwill has been allocated to the O&P
North America CGU and is deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.

The fair value of acquired trade receivables was €6.6 million. The gross contractual amounts
receivable are €6.6 million, of which none was expected to be uncollectable at the date of acquisition.

_Acquisition related costs_

The Group incurred acquisition related costs in connection with the transaction of €0.1 million
which were charged to administrative expenses in the Group’s consolidated income statement during the
year ended December 31, 2021.

**_Updates to prior years_**

**Gemini**

On December 31, 2020, the Group acquired 50% of the ordinary shares in Gemini HDPE LLC
(“Gemini”) from Sasol Chemicals North America LLC for cash consideration of $223.8 million
(€187.3 million). The principal activity of the company is to produce high density polyethylene in La Porte,
Texas, USA under tolling arrangements with its owners who provide the feedstock and pay a fee for this
service. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100%. Prior to the acquisition the Group
reflected its 50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture (see Note 12a).

As Gemini HDPE LLC is a toll manufacturer on behalf of its owners the overall direct impact on
the 2020 Group revenue and profit and loss had the acquisition occurred at the start of 2020 was immaterial.

The fair values assigned to the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities were reviewed
during the year ended December 31, 2021 which resulted in an update to the net assets acquired. In
addition, the purchase agreement provided for corrections for actual net working capital contributions
compared to target which resulted in a final consideration payment of €0.4 million during the year ended
December 31, 2021.

**Difference between consideration and net assets acquired . . . . . . . . . .** **138.8** **(22.7)** **116.1**


The difference between consideration and net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill
within intangible assets (see Note 11) and has arisen because of the expected synergies and the ability of
the Group to market the full output of Gemini. The goodwill has been allocated to the O&P North America
reporting segment and is deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.

_Settlement of pre-existing contractual relationship_

INEOS and Gemini are parties to four pre-existing agreements namely, a tolling agreement, a
ground lease, a licensing agreement and an operating contract. At the acquisition date these pre-existing
relationships were effectively settled as part of the acquisition.

The fair value of the agreements at the acquisition date was nil, and consequently there is no
adjustment to the consideration paid or income or cost associated with the settlement of the relationship
reflected in the Group financial statements.

_Acquisition related costs_

The Group did not incur any acquisition related costs in connection with the transaction.

Prior to the acquisition date, the Group’s interest in the Gemini joint venture was accounted for in
accordance with the equity method of accounting. As a result of the acquisition the previously held interest
of 50% has been disposed of for a fair value of €187.3 million ($223.8 million), being the equivalent of the
value paid to Sasol for their 50% shareholding. Therefore, the gain on the previously held equity interest in
Gemini has been calculated as follows:

**_Acquisition of subsidiaries in prior years_**

**WL Plastics**

On November 1, 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one
of the largest high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America for an initial
consideration of €162.1 million. The business is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas with production
facilities in Kentucky, South Dakota, Utah, Texas, and Wyoming. WL Plastics has over 500 million pounds
of annual production capacity and provides HDPE pipe for use in oil, gas, industrial, mining, conduit,
and municipal water and sewer applications. This acquisition forms part of the O&P North America segment.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group paid a further €15.6 million (2019:
€15.0 million) which was the final instalment of the contingent consideration which was subject to the
acquired business achieving certain targets over a three year period.

**INESCO combined heat and power plant**

On March 1, 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of RWE Generation Belgium NV, the
owner of a Cogeneration unit on the Oxide Antwerp site in Belgium for cash consideration of €70.4 million.
The business consists of two 50MW units and an additional 35MW steam generator. All the steam and
approximately one third of the electricity is consumed by the Group and a number of co-siting companies
on the site in Antwerp. The remainder of the electricity is sold to the Belgian electricity grid, through a short
term marketing contract with the previous owner RWE. This acquisition forms part of the Chemical
Intermediates segment and is defined as a business under IFRS 3.

For the ten month period since March 1, 2019, the acquired business contributed revenue of
€123.5 million and an EBITDA of €14.3 million. If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019,
management estimates that the business would have contributed revenues of €148.5 million and EBITDA
of €17.1 million.

**3. ACQUISITIONS (continued)**

**_Acquisition of assets in prior years_**

**Shale oil and gas assets**

In April 2019 the Group purchased 104 active oil and gas wells and three non-active oil and gas
wells located in the Giddings Fields in Texas USA. In addition to the purchase of the wells the Group
acquired all acreage associated with each well. The total cash consideration for the assets was €27.2 million
which included €24.4 million in respect of intangible well rights, €2.6 million relating to property, plant
and equipment and €0.2 million relating to inventories.

**_Exceptional cost of sales_**

The Group recognised an exceptional impairment charge of €118.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 in relation to plant and equipment following the Group’s decision to terminate work on
a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated infrastructure at its site in Antwerp, Belgium (see Note 10).

**_Exceptional administrative (gain)/expense_**

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. Poor operating performance and uneconomic capital expenditure requirements to meet safety
and environmental obligations led to the decision. As a result, an exceptional administrative charge of
€35.1 million was incurred in 2019 for closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses, together
with decommissioning and demolition costs. In addition, tangible fixed assets at the facility of €33.3 million
were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019 along with a further €26.2 million impairment
charge in the year ended December 31, 2020 (see Note 10). During the year ended December 31, 2021 an
exceptional administrative gain of €8.9 million was credited to the income statement following the final true
up of the original closure cost provision made in December 2019 as a result of lower than expected
demolition costs.

An exceptional administrative expense of €8.9 million has been charged during 2020, which related
to a provision for early retirement costs as part of a restructuring of the Koln site within the O&P Europe
business.

An exceptional administrative charge of €13.0 million was also incurred during 2019 relating to the
settlement of an intellectual property dispute in respect of the former Technologies business.

**_Exceptional finance costs_**

In November 2021 following the early redemption of the Senior Notes due 2024, an exceptional
finance cost of €3.5 million was recognised following the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with
the redeemed Notes.

In April 2019 following the early redemption of the Senior Secured Notes due 2023, an exceptional
finance cost of €11.7 million was recognised which included an early prepayment premium of €7.7 million
and the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with the redeemed Notes of €4.0 million.

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units (CGU) or groups of cash generating units as
follows:

The recoverable amount is based on the value in use of each CGU based on the latest board
approved five year plan. The forecasts are based on current performance and management’s assumptions
regarding the future development of individual parameters including raw material prices and profit margins,
utilising available market pricing forecasts. Future assumptions regarding market demand are based on
external macroeconomic sources and specific data relevant to the petrochemical industry and management’s
knowledge of the local markets in which it operates.

The cash flows after the plan period are based on an average of each of the years in the five year
plan to take account of the cyclical nature of the industry extrapolated using long term growth rates as set
out in the table below.

No impairment charge has been recorded in these financial statements as a result of the annual
impairment test.

The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for all CGUs are shown below:

**2021** **2020** **2019**
Period on which management approved forecasts are based . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years 5 years 5 years
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.5% 8.5% 8.5%
Growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0% 3.0% 3.0%

A terminal value is calculated based on the average cash flows over the five year forecasting period
assuming compound growth of 3% and is discounted over the expected lives of the assets of 40 years.

When determining the discount rate the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group is
considered at each respective period end.

The growth rate used includes inflationary growth across our various markets.

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)**

The estimated recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount for all cash generating units.

Sensitivity analysis on the recoverable amount was performed based on a 10% increase in the
discount rate and a 10% decrease to the growth rate and a CGU earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortisation and exceptional items, measured under IFRS, all of which are considered a reasonable
possible change in estimate. Neither of these changes resulted in the recoverable amount being lower than
the carrying amount.

**_Joint ventures_**

On July 1, 2011 the group restructured the Refining business into a new joint venture between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (‘II(J)L’), a related party. II(J)L is held under
common control by our controlling shareholders. The consideration received by the Group for the disposal
consisted of cash consideration of $1.015 billion received from PetroChina for a 50% interest in the
business and an investment in non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L for the other 50% interest in the business.

The Group retains an economic interest in the Refining business by virtue of its investment in
II(J)L. The results of the Refining business are reported within the share of profit/(loss) of associates and
joint ventures using the equity accounting method by virtue of the Group’s effective control of II(J)L. The
Group has no ongoing obligations to fund the Refining business.

In July 2014 the Group set up a new joint venture entity (Gemini HDPE LLC) with Sasol to build
and operate an HDPE plant at the Battleground site in Texas, USA. The Gemini plant became fully
operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018 €12.9 million was invested into the joint venture. On
December 31, 2020 the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture to become the
100% owner of the plant which resulted in the disposal of the Group’s previous 50% equity accounted interest
of €109.0 million and a gain on disposal of €78.3 million (see Note 3).

In October 2020 the Group invested €1.6 million into a joint venture set up with a Chinese partner
to jointly develop Acrylonitrile technology for use within the Chinese market, and to protect against misuse of technology where appropriate. During 2021 the Group invested a further €3.3 million into the joint
venture.

Before being disposed the Group held a non-voting preferred partnership interest in INEOS
Investments Partnership, an entity held under common control by the Group’s ultimate shareholders, which
owned 24% of the share capital of the PQ Corporation, a silicas business incorporated in the USA and
listed on the New York stock exchange.

In 2019 the Group disposed of its preferential interest in INEOS Investments Partnership following

related party, for €260.5 million ($296.5 million) which resulted in a profit on disposal of €2.6 million.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit
through future taxable profits is probable based on an assessment of expected future profits modelled
against the gross unused tax losses, deductible temporary differences and unused tax credits. The Group did
not recognise gross deductible temporary and tax losses of €606.6 million (2020: €123.8 million, 2019:
€95.9 million) due to uncertainty in respect of the existence of future probable taxable profits against which
these tax attributes can be utilised. As at 31 December 2021 there are also net unrecognised unprovided
foreign tax credits of €37.9 million (2020: €32.7 million).

The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its overseas
subsidiaries or joint ventures as the Group can control the timing and realisation of these temporary
differences, and it is probable that no material unprovided tax liability would arise.

customers (see Note 25.c). At December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 there were no significant trade, related
party or other receivable balances not past due that were subsequently impaired.

Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the Group, there is no significant
concentration of credit risk (2020: nil, 2019: nil).

During 2019, 2020 and 2021 there were no significant trade, related party or other receivable
balances that were subject to renegotiation of terms. Credit enhancements are held in respect of trade and
other receivables in the form of €16.1 million (2020: €nil, 2019: €nil) of assets pledged as security against
amounts owed to the Group of which €nil (2020: €nil, 2019: €nil) is in respect of amounts falling overdue.

Trade receivable balances totalling €1,300.2 million (2020: €776.4 million, 2019: €770.0 million)
have been pledged as security against amounts drawn down under the Receivables Securitisation Facility,
described in Note 19, totalling €18.0 million (2020: €114.2 million, 2019: €297.1 million). In accordance with
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ the trade receivable balances pledged as security do not qualify for
derecognition and are included within the trade receivable balances above.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was

The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record any impairment losses unless the
Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is probable; at that point the amounts considered
irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly.

The credit risk grade is based on the analysis on both the quantitative and qualitative factors as
detailed below:

    - High: Customers under significant financial difficulty and customers for whom there is an
uncertainty of payment based on knowledge of factors like insolvency, dispute. Any receivable
more than 180 days past due should also be classified in this category.

    - Medium: Any receivable between 90 and 180 days past due should be classified as medium risk
unless qualitative factors indicate a higher credit risk.

     - Low: Any receivable less than 90 days past due should be classified as low risk unless qualitative
factors indicate a higher credit risk.

During the year the Group has not experienced a significant deterioration in the quality of
receivable balances due to the current economic conditions.

**21 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**_Pension plans_**

The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with
local conditions and practices. The plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by
payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies. The principal funded plans are in the
United Kingdom, North America, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany.

The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and
France.

The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit plans were carried out as follows:

**Plan** **Country** **Valuation date**
All Plans United Kingdom 5 April 2019 and 31 December 2019
All Plans North America 1 January 2021
All Plans Belgium 1 January 2022
All Plans France 31 December 2021
All Plans Germany 31 December 2021
All Plans Switzerland 31 December 2021

These valuations have been updated where appropriate to December 31, 2021 by independent
qualified actuaries.

The Group’s pension schemes have been disclosed on a geographical basis as those schemes in the
United Kingdom, North America and Other European. Other European principally includes the Group’s
pension plans in Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland.

The UK defined benefit pension plans were historically final salary in nature, with a normal
retirement age of 60. The majority of the UK plans are either closed to new entrants, or frozen to future
accrual. The plans operate under trust law and are managed and administered by Trustees in accordance with
the terms of each plan’s Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The contributions paid to the UK
plans are set every three years based on a funding agreement between the company and Trustee after taking
actuarial advice.

The North American pension arrangements consist of two funded plans, both closed to new
entrants and future accrual. Both plans were final salary defined benefit in nature, and the plans’ liabilities
are valued regularly in line with US statutory funding requirements. Around 90% of both plans’ assets are
invested in bond instruments, to closely match the profile of each plans’ liabilities.

The Other European pension arrangements are primarily final salary in nature, the majority of
which remain open to new entrants. The majority of plans in Germany are funded through plan assets
from contractual trust arrangements. There are no legal minimum funding requirements, thus the Group
can decide on any plan contributions considering local conditions and practices. The Swiss benefits are
insured, the Belgian plan assets are held in trust, and the remaining schemes are unfunded with associated
provisions held on the Group’s balance sheet.

**_Pension plan assumptions_**

The principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages or ranges) at the year end
were as follows:

**United Kingdom** **North America** **Other European**
**2021** **2020** **2019** **2021** **2020 2019** **2021** **2020** **2019**
**%**
**Major assumptions**
Rate of general increase in salaries . . . . . . 3.2 2.8 3.2 3.5 3.5 3.5 2.0-4.5 2.0-4.3 2.0-4.5
Rate of increase to pensions in payment . . 3.0-5.0 3.0-5.0 3.0-5.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0-2.0 0.0-1.8 0.0-1.8
Discount rate for scheme liabilities . . . . . . 1.9 1.6 2.1 2.8 2.5 3.3 0.3-1.3 0.0-2.0 0.8-2.5

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the reporting date are
based on standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity.
The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65-year old to live for a number of years as follows:

**United Kingdom** **North America** **Other European**
**2021** **2020** **2019** **2021** **2020** **2019** **2021** **2020** **2019**

current pensioners . . . . . 22.1-24.3 22.0-24.2 22.2-24.4 21.4-22.8 21.2-22.6 21.5-22.9 20.5-28.4 20.3-28.0 22.3-28.0

The following table presents the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to each significant
actuarial assumption:

**United** **North** **Other**
**Kingdom** **America** **European**
**2021**
**%**
**Major assumptions**
Discount rate: 1.0% decrease . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21.1 15.1 24.9
Rate of inflation: 0.5% increase[(1)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.1 N/A 6.3
One year increase in longevity for a member currently aged 65 . . . . . . . . . . . 4.2 1.5 3.1

(1) The sensitivity to the inflation assumption change includes corresponding changes to the future salary increase and future pension
increase assumptions where these assumptions are set to be linked to the inflation assumption.

**_Post-retirement health care plans_**

The Group also operates a number of post-retirement healthcare plans in the United States, which
provide employees with other post-employment benefits in respect of health care. The plans are unfunded
and the liability in respect of these benefits is included in provisions. The liability is assessed by qualified
independent actuaries under the projected unit method, assuming the following rates:

**2021** **2020** **2019**
**%**
**Rates**
Liability discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.8 2.5 3.3

**25a Fair value of financial instruments**

**_Investments in debt and equity securities_**

The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is estimated as the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are accounted for at fair value
based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily available based on the
present value of future cash flows estimated from financial information made available during the year as a
result of a recent transaction in the investment. However, as explained in Note 14, the Group’s financial
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include certain equity interests which are not quoted
and for which there is no active market. The Group considers that the acquisition cost to be a reasonable
approximation for fair value.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other receivables generally approximates to fair value due to
their short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair
value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels, determined in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, have been defined as
follows:

     - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

     - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

     - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

The commodity derivatives are fair valued using rates in quoted markets. There have been no
transfers between any levels in 2021 (2020 and 2019: no transfers between levels).

**25b Net gains and losses from financial instruments**

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the results of valuations, the amortisation
of discounts, the recognition and derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign
currencies, interest, dividends and all effects on profit or loss of financial instruments.

Net gains from financial assets measured at amortised cost relate primarily to recognition and
derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign currencies and interest income.

Net losses from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost relate primarily to amortisation of
discounts, results from the translation of foreign currencies, interest expense and other financing related
expenses.

The item ‘financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss’ comprise valuation gains and
losses, and only includes gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments
as defined by IFRS 9.

**25c Credit risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, deposits with financial institutions and derivatives.

Group Treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimize the likelihood that the
Group will experience financial loss due to counterparty failure and to ensure that in the event of a single
loss, the failure of any single counterparty would not materially impact the financial wellbeing of the Group.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group’s customer base, including


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an
influence on credit risk. Management considers that there is no geographical concentration of credit risk.
The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for
creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are
adjusted accordingly. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases
bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open
amount without requiring approval. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness
may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.

**_Investments, cash and cash equivalent_**

Surplus cash investments are only made with banks with which the Group has a relationship.

**_Guarantees_**

The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2021 no guarantees were outstanding (2020: none, 2019: none).

**_Exposure to credit risk_**

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was the carrying amount of financial assets. Further
details on the Group’s exposure to credit risk are given in Note 18.

**25d Liquidity risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by
the fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short,
medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.

The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary
company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget.

The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and
monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at
bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a
monthly basis the level of headroom on existing facilities is reported and forecast forward until the end of
the financial period.

In addition, the Group maintains various lines of credits in the form of Senior Secured Notes,
Senior Secured Term Loans, Securitisation, Rafnes Facility, Koln CoGen Facility, Gemini Facility and
Other loans. (See Note 19—“Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings” for more information).

The Group does not have derivative commodity contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2021.

The Group has US$ and Sterling financial liabilities in respect of the Senior Notes and Securitisation
Facility that are designated net investment hedges of US$ and Sterling operations in accordance with the
requirements of IFRS 9. The US$ and Sterling net investment hedges had a carrying value and fair value as
follows:

**Carrying** **Carrying** **Carrying**

For the year ended December 31, 2021 gains net of tax of €479.2 million were taken directly to
reserves and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended (2020: losses
€527.4 million, 2019: gains €88.0 million). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2021 (2020: €nil, 2019: €nil). The cumulative net investment hedge reserve
amount as at December 31, 2021 was €442.7 million (2020: €(36.5) million, 2019: €490.9 million).

**25f Market risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Market risk reflects the possibility that changes in market prices, such as crude oil, feedstock
refined products, chemicals or currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates will adversely affect the
value of the Group’s assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Group holds commodity and interest
rate swap contracts in order to manage market risk. The use of derivative instruments is confined to
specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

**_Market risk—Foreign currency risk_**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the U.S. Dollar and Sterling.

Foreign exchange risk arises from net investments in foreign operations, future commercial
transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities.

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of
a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. When the settlement of
a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the
foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item is considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and changes in the fair value are recognised directly
within equity.

A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar and the
euro. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs
are denominated in euro and sterling. In the U.S. petrochemical and specialty chemicals businesses, product
prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Group generally does not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge foreign
currency transaction exposure, although the Group has done so in the past and may do so in the future.

The Group benefits from natural hedging, to the extent that currencies in which net cash flows are
generated from the Group’s operations, are matched against long-term indebtedness.

The foreign currency exposure where the Group’s external financial assets/(liabilities) are not
denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved is shown below. Foreign exchange
differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the other comprehensive income of the
Group.

**_Market risk—Commodity price risk_**

This section discusses the Group’s exposure to the commodity contracts which are not covered
under the own use exemption and are recognised as derivative instruments.

The Group and its Refining joint venture are exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations
in raw material prices and sales of products. The raw material exposures result primarily from the price of
crude oil and base chemicals linked to the price of crude. The sales price exposures are primarily related to
petrochemicals where prices are in general linked to the market price of crude oil.

The Group enters into contracts to supply or acquire physical volumes of commodities at future
dates during the normal course of business that may be considered derivative contracts. Where such


-----

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

contracts exist and are in respect of the normal purchase or sale of products to fulfil the Group’s
requirements, the own use exemption from derivative accounting is applied.

The Group manages commodity price exposures through trading refined products and chemical
feedstock and using commodity swaps, options and futures as a means of managing price and timing risks.
In 2021 there was a net mark to market derivative asset in respect of commodity contracts of €20.0 million
entered into by the Group to manage such risk (2020: net derivative liability of €57.6 million, 2019: net
derivative liability of €44.2 million).

The Group operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those
relating to the default of counterparties, are minimised.

**_Market risk—Equity price risk_**

The Group’s exposure to equity price risk arises from its investment in equity securities which are
classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial assets are
accounted for at fair value based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily
available.

For the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income a 10 percent increase and
decrease in transaction prices at the reporting date would have decreased and increased the loss for the year
by €2.8 million (2020: €2.8 million, 2019: €2.8 million). Management consider that a change of 10 percent
gives an appropriate benchmark to assess the risks that the Group is expected to be exposed to. This calculation
assumes that the change occurred at the reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at
that date. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Group defines its capital employed of €8,986.2 million (2020: €7,701.2 million, 2019:
€7,326.3 million) as shareholders’ equity of €3,353.0 million (2020: €1,461.6 million, 2019: €1,456.4 million)
and net debt (net of debt issue costs) of €5,633.2 million (2020: €6,239.6 million, 2019: €5,869.9 million).

The principal sources of debt available to the Group at December 31, 2021 include the Senior
Secured Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes due March 2026, Senior Secured Notes due May 2026, Senior
Secured Notes due 2025, Receivables Securitisation Facility, Inventory Financing Facility, Schuldschein Loan,
Rafnes Facility, Koln CoGen Facility and the Gemini Facility and are described in Note 19 along with the
key operating and financial covenants that apply to these facilities.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends
paid to shareholders, issue new shares, raise new debt or sell assets to reduce debt. The ability of the Group
to pay dividends and provide appropriate facilities to the Group is restricted by the terms of principal
financing agreements to which members of the Group are party.

**29. RELATED PARTIES (continued)**

During 2015 the Group provided a loan of $623.7 million to INEOS Upstream Limited, a related
party, in connection with its acquisition of natural gas assets in the North Sea. The loan facility is unsecured
and matures in June 2024 and bears interest at 7% per annum. On September 29, 2017, INEOS Upstream

assets and businesses which were divested by the Group on July 1, 2014 and the refining joint ventures between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited, a related party. Previous to becoming a fully owned
subsidiary on December 31, 2020 (see Note 3) the Group had a joint venture with Sasol Limited to build and
operate a HDPE plant at Battleground site in Texas, USA which became operational at the end of 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Group made no sales (2020: €0.1 million, 2019:
€0.1 million), recovered net costs of €12.4 million (2020: €0.2 million, 2019: €0.5 million) and made no
purchases (2020: €0.2 million, 2019: €0.2 million) from the French joint ventures. As at December 31, 2021

(2020: nil, 2019: €0.2 million) was owed to the French joint ventures.

The Refining joint ventures are between PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited, a

Before the HDPE joint venture became a fully owned subsidiary of the Group on December 31,
2020 (see Note 3) the Group recovered costs of €60.5 million (2019: €59.1 million) and made purchases of
€43.6 million (2019: €47.9 million) from the HDPE joint venture. As at December 31, 2019, €5.6 million was

in respect of these related party derivative financial instruments (see Note 15).

In general, any trading balances with related parties are priced based on contractual arrangements
and are to be settled in cash. The transactions are made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s
length transactions.

None (2020: none, 2019: none) of the related party balances are secured and no guarantees have
been given or received. There were no provisions for doubtful debt related to any related parties as at
December 31, 2021 (2020: nil, 2019: nil).

**_Compensation to key management personnel (including directors)_**

The Group defines key management as the directors of the Company. Details of Directors’
remuneration are given in Note 7.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**30. ULTIMATE PARENT UNDERTAKING AND CONTROLLING PARTY**

The immediate parent undertaking is INEOS Holdings Luxembourg S.A.. The ultimate parent
undertaking at December 31, 2021 was INEOS Limited, a company registered in the Isle of Man. The
ultimate controlling party is Mr JA Ratcliffe, director and majority shareholder of the ultimate parent
undertaking. INEOS Group Holdings S.A. and its subsidiaries are not included within any other consolidated
financial statements.

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, which require
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect the application of the accounting
policies, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates change and in any future periods.

**Key sources of estimated uncertainty**

Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that the
Group believe are reasonable, including assets and expected economic conditions, and in certain cases
actuarial assumption. Although these estimates are based on the Group’s knowledge of current events and
circumstances, actual numbers may differ.

**_Post-retirement benefits_**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-employment schemes. Under IAS 19
Revised Employee Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined
benefit obligation of each of the defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined
benefit schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve making
numerous assumptions, including:

     - Future rate of increase in salaries;

     - Inflation rate projections;

     - Discount rate for scheme liabilities; and

    - Expected rates of return on the scheme assets.

Details of post-retirement benefits are set out in Note 21.

**32. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

The Group does not have operations in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. During 2021 revenue generated
in these countries was not material to the Group. The Group is not currently experiencing any material
disruption to its operations and does not foresee any direct impact as a result of the conflict, but will continue
to monitor the evolving situation closely. The conflict has led to a significant increase in energy prices;
however the Group is currently successfully managing these increases by passing them onto customers
through higher prices. Therefore the Group is not expecting any material indirect impact on its operations
or performance as a result of the conflict, but is monitoring this closely.

To the Shareholders of
Ineos Group Holdings S.A.

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

**Opinion**

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Ineos Group Holdings S.A. and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2020, and
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of
the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2020, and its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 on the audit profession (Law
of July 23, 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of July 23,
2016 and ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF are further described in the “Responsibilities of
the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements” section of our
report. We are also independent of the Group in accordance with the International Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, including International Independence Standards, issued by the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and
have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information stated in the consolidated annual report including the management report but does not
include the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be
materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in
this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Responsibilities of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a


-----

report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and
with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of July 23, 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

     - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.

     - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

    - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

    - Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our report of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé” to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the
“réviseur d’entreprises agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to
cease to continue as a going concern.

     - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

     - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Other matter**

As part of our audit of the 2020 consolidated financial statements, we also audited the adjustments
described in Note 1, paragraph “Restatement of comparatives” that were applied to amend the 2018
consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly
applied. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2018 consolidated financial
statements of the Group other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an
opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2018 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Overview**

INEOS Group Holdings S.A. (the “Company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the
form of a société anonyme under the laws of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office
at 58, rue Charles Martel, L-2134 Luxembourg, Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. The nature of the
operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are the manufacture and sale of a
range of petrochemical products used in a variety of applications.

**Basis of accounting**

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together
referred to as the “Group”) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and joint ventures.

In early March 2020, the Group developed contingency plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, with
the primary objectives of maintaining the safety of personnel and the reliable operation of the Group’s
plants. This resulted in a number of changes to standard working practices and shift patterns to reduce
personnel on site to those defined as operationally critical in order to adhere to social distancing rules in line
with local government advice. Any safety critical activity was formally risk assessed to take cognizance of
additional controls necessary to protect core personnel from COVID-19, hence safeguarding safety critical
work at all times.

The chemical industry is deemed as essential, critical infrastructure by governments across the
world. Throughout the pandemic all of the Group’s plants have continued to operate fully and supply
chains have operated without significant disruption. Protecting employees and ensuring that they remain
healthy has been the first priority of the Group. All plants have sufficient resources and have implemented
measures to ensure that this remains the case throughout the pandemic.

Whilst there is uncertainty due to the COVID-19 crisis the Directors have undertaken a rigorous
assessment of the potential impact of COVID-19 on demand for its products and services and the impact
on margins for the next 12 months. In addition, the Directors have implemented a series of programmes to
preserve cash including the review of timing of turnarounds, reductions in the levels of non-essential capital
expenditure and reductions in non-essential fixed cost expenditure. On the basis of this assessment
together with cash balances of €1,342.2 million as at December 31, 2020 and access to the Receivables
Securitisation Facility and the Inventory Financing Facility (see Note 19), the Directors have concluded
that the Group can operate within its current facilities without the need to obtain new ones for a period of
at least 12 months from the date of this report and have therefore prepared these consolidated financial
statements on a going concern basis.

The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union in response
to the IAS regulation (EC 1606/2002) effective as of December 31, 2020 and have been approved for issuance
by the Board of Directors on March 19, 2021.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial
instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or fair value through
other comprehensive income which are stated at their fair value.

**Functional and presentation currency**

These Group financial statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the
majority of operations, with other significant currencies being USD and Sterling. The Group’s primary
products are sold in an international commodities market which is priced and invoiced primarily in euros.

All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest €0.1 million.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Changes in accounting policies**

The Group financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies with the
those of the previous financial year. The Group has adopted the following amendments to accounting
standards for the first time in 2020 with effect from 1 January 2020, although there has been no material
effect on the Group’s financial statements.

    - Amendments to IFRS 3: Definition of a Business has been adopted from 1 January 2020. The
Group has applied this amendment to business combinations whose acquisition dates are on or
after 1 January 2020 in assessing whether it had acquired a business of a group of assets. The
details of accounting policies are set out in Note 1—“Business combinations, goodwill and
intangible assets.”

    - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform has been
adopted from 1 January 2020. This has been applied retrospectively to hedging relationships that
existed at 1 January 2020 or were designated thereafter and that are directly affected by interest
rate benchmark reform. These amendments also apply to any gain or loss accumulated in the cash
flow hedging reserve that existed at 1 January 2020. The details of the accounting policies are
disclosed in Note 1—“Derivative financial instruments and hedging.”

    - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards: The Conceptual
Framework for Financial Reporting is the foundation on which the IASB develops new accounting
standards. The revised Framework is more comprehensive than the old one—its aim is to
provide the Board with the full set of tools for standard setting. It covers all aspects of standard
setting from the objective of financial reporting, to presentation and disclosures.

    - Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of Material: The IASB refined its definition of
material to make it easier to understand. “Information is material if omitting, misstating or
obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general
purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide
financial information about a specific reporting entity.”

**Basis of consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The
Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations, except acquisitions
under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. The consideration transferred for the
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination of a subsidiary or joint venture is achieved in stages, the acquisition
date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair
value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit
or loss.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be
an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 in the profit or loss. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are
also recorded in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The
fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest
as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of
the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to profit or loss.

_Special purpose entities (“SPE”)_

An SPE is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the
Group and the SPE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it controls the SPE. The Group has
established an SPE, INEOS Finance Ireland Limited, for a debt securitisation programme. The Group does
not have any direct or indirect shareholdings in this SPE. INEOS Finance Ireland Limited is controlled by
the Group as it was established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers of
the SPE’s management that result in the Group receiving the majority of the benefits related to the SPE’s
operations and net assets, being exposed to the majority of risks arising from the SPE’s activities, and
retaining the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPE and its assets. INEOS Finance
Ireland Limited is therefore regarded as an SPE and has been consolidated in these financial statements.

_Associates_

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of
the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes
goodwill identified on acquisition. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its
share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive
income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share
of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the
investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the
amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates’ in the income statement.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and
its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s
interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

_Joint arrangements_

The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint
arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights
and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined
them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and
movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or
exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part
of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it
has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the
extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**Foreign exchange**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised
in the consolidated income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial
liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges,
which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured
in terms of historical cost in a foreign exchange are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value
are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was
determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments
arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency, euros, at foreign exchange
rates ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The Group applies an average rate for the year where this
rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences
arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. They are
recycled into the consolidated income statement upon disposal.

Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign
operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation
reserve. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of a borrowing designated as a hedge of
a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in OCI, in the translation reserve, to the extent
that the hedge is effective. When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative
amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet
the following two conditions:

(a) They include no contractual obligation upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial
assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is
either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its
own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial
liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts
presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude
amounts in relation to those shares.

**Non-derivative financial instruments**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and
other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition they are tested for
classification as per IFRS 9. If the trade receivables satisfy the criteria for cash flow characteristics test and
business model test as per IFRS 9, then they are recognised at amortised cost. If they do not qualify for
being recognised at amortised cost they are recognised at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value
through other comprehensive income.

_Trade and other payables_

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Investments in debt securities are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following
conditions and are not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income only if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

For investment in equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to
present subsequent changes to fair value in other comprehensive income. The Group makes this election on
an investment-by-investment basis.

All other financial assets, including derivatives, are classified as measured at fair value through
profit and loss. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised
directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing,
interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Where no reliable
measurement of fair value is available, investments are stated at historic acquisition cost.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash balances and call deposits.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_

Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

_Debt restructuring_

The Group derecognises financial liabilities in accordance with the provisions in IFRS 9. When
debt is modified, the Group analyses the modifications from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective
to determine if the modifications are substantial and meet the IFRS requirements for de-recognition, in
which case the debt is treated as extinguished. All fees paid in connection with a debt extinguishment are
expensed immediately. When a modification is accounted for as a non-substantial modification, associated
fees incurred are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the liability and amortised using the
original effective interest rate.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging**

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on subsequent
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as finance
income or expense. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

**Hedge of net investment of foreign operation**

The Group applied hedge accounting to foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation
of a foreign currency loan where the loan is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
in accordance with IFRS 9.

Most commonly this means that exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign currency
loans designated as a net investment hedge are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive
income. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to the statement of
comprehensive income when the foreign operation is sold.

When a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging
instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses
is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of the
changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is
recognised immediately in the income statement. The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to the income
statement as a reclassification adjustment on disposal of the foreign operation.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may
include the cost of materials, labour and other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working
condition for their intended use. Cost may also include the cost of dismantling and removing items and
restoring the site on which they are located.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences
from the date an asset is brought into service. Land and assets in the course of construction are not
depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

     - Buildings 10 - 40 years

     - Plant and equipment and fixtures and fittings 3 - 40 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where an indicator of
impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s
fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the
consolidated income statement in the period in which the item is derecognised.

**Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the Acquisition method, except
acquisitions under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. Goodwill represents amounts
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Acquisitions under common control are accounted for at book value. The difference in the book
value of the assets acquired and consideration paid is recognised in a distributable merger reserve.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of
cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. The cash generating units
within the Group are predominately business units. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
statement.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property
rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and license fees.

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. The initial cost is
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of other consideration given to acquire the assets. An intangible


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is
separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

    - Customer relationships 3 - 12 years

     - Intellectual property rights 10 - 15 years

    - Non-compete agreements life of the agreement

    - Licenses up to 15 years

These intangible assets are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Useful lives are examined
on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

_Research and development_

Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense
as incurred.

Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Group intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan
or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Where
regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is recognised in
the income statement. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense
as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less
accumulated impairment losses.

**Impairment of financial assets**

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group applies the simplified approach when providing for expected credit losses prescribed by
IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and contract assets. This approach requires the Group to recognise the
lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables taking in consideration historical as well as forwardlooking information.

Where the Group has assessed the probability of default of a financial asset to be low, the loss
allowance is considered immaterial.

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the
financial assets classified at amortised cost at each balance sheet date and adjusts the allowance accordingly.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Impairment of equity securities classified as FVOCI are not tested for impairment under IFRS 9.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as FVOCI increases and the increase can be objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Impairment of non-financial assets excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax
assets are assessed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment.

For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets
that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the end of the reporting period.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount
of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups of assets.

_Calculation of recoverable amount_

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

_Reversals of impairment_

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.

In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the
impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in first-out or average cost method, and
net realisable value which is defined as the estimated selling price less the estimated cost of completion and
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories,
production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads
based on normal operating capacity. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where
appropriate.

Items owned by the Group that are held on consignment at another entity’s premises are included
as part of the Group’s inventory.

**Commodities**

Contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of
non-financial items in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own-use
contracts) are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments, but rather as executory contracts.

**IFRS 16 Leases**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

**_Group as a lessee_**

_Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of
right- of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized and lease payments made at or before
the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and
remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease
incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying
asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group
will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the
underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition,
the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit
in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate (initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date), amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees less any lease incentives
receivable. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group
exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate
are expensed in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on
the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments a change in the
assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset,
a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the
Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way and there has been no change in the scope of the
lease, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded
in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to all leases that have a lease term
of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. The Group also
applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of assets that are valued below €10,000.
Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straightline basis over the lease term.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**_Lease policies applicable prior to 1 January 2019_**

_Operating lease payments_

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the consolidated
income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.

_Finance lease payments_

Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

**Employee benefits**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans and funded and unfunded defined
benefit pension schemes. The Group also provides unfunded early retirement benefits, long service awards
and an incentive plan for certain employees.

The Group provides health care insurance to eligible retired employees and their dependants,
primarily in the United States.

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the
consolidated income statement as incurred.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The liability discount rate is
the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and that have
maturity dates approximating to the terms of, the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

When the benefits of a plan are amended or curtailed, the portion of the increased or decreased
benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense immediately in the consolidated
income statement.

Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the
present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The pension scheme surplus (to the extent that it is recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full.

The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split between:

     - cost of sales and administrative expenses,

     - net finance costs and,

    - in net expense recognised directly in equity, the remeasurements of post employment benefit
obligations.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term


-----

_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

**Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Revenue**

Revenue represents the invoiced value of products and services sold or services provided to third
parties net of sales discounts, value added taxes and duties. Contracts for goods and services are analysed
to determine the distinct performance obligations against which revenue should be recognised. The amount
to be recognised is determined from the standalone selling prices for goods and services, allocated to the
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring a promised good or service to a customer.

The pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and arrangements)
or is linked by a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional amount (formula
contracts). Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are dispatched or delivered
depending on the relevant delivery terms and point at which the control of the good or service is transferred
to the customer.

Services provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other
chemical companies with facilities on our sites and services under tolling arrangements. Under tolling
arrangements, customers pay for or provide raw materials to be converted into certain specified products,
for which the Group charges a toll fee. The Group only recognises toll fee as revenue earned under such
arrangements upon shipment of the converted product to the customer as this is the point at which the
control of the service is transferred to the buyer. For all other services, revenue is recognised at a point in
time. There are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time.

**Government grants**

Government grants are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income. This income is
amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the tangible fixed asset to which it relates or the
life of the related project.

**Finance income and expenses**

Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the consolidated income statement as it
accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated income
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign exchange gains and losses
are reported on a gross basis.

Finance costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on leases, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, net fair value losses on derivatives, net interest on employee benefit liabilities and foreign
exchange losses that are recognised in the consolidated income statement (see foreign exchange accounting
policy).

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and from related party loans, net
fair value gains on derivatives and foreign exchange gains.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the
consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination;
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at
the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if it is possible that there is a
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets because they relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**Segmental analysis**

The Group determines its operating segments in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief operating decision-makers are responsible for
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The chief operating decisionmakers are the members of the Executive Committee of the ultimate parent undertaking, INEOS Limited.

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with
any of the Group’s other components and for which discrete financial information is available. An operating
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision-makers to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.

The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is based on business segments. The business
segments are determined based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and the
aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8.

Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-makers include items directly
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Segment capital expenditure is the total payments made during the period to acquire property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets other than as acquired through business combinations.

**Emission trading scheme**

The Group participates in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Scheme encourages companies
to reduce carbon emissions by offering financial incentives if they achieve their annual reduction targets. If
a company reduces emissions beyond their target then the surplus may be traded in the form of emissions
permits.

The incentive money due from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is recognised in the consolidated
income statement once the reduction targets have been met. The emissions permits allocated under the
Scheme are at nil cost. The Group recognises the revenue from such permits upon their sale to third parties.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

The Group recognises a provision for emissions produced. The provision is measured at the
carrying amount of the emission rights held (nil if granted, otherwise at cost) or, in the case of a shortfall,
at the current fair value of the emission rights needed.

**Exceptional items**

In order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating
performance of the Group’s ongoing business it separately identifies those profits and losses which because
of their size or nature, are outside the normal course of business so are expected to be non-recurring.
This may include the disposal of businesses, the impairment of non-current assets, the cost of restructuring
acquired or existing businesses, the impact of one off events such as legal settlements or finance costs
relating to call premia and write-off of unamortised debt issue costs following substantial modification or
redemption of debt as exceptional items.

**Accounting standards not applied**

A number of new standards and amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after
1 January 2020 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or
amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

The impact of their adoption is being assessed and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Group’s financial statements in the period of initial application unless otherwise indicated:

    - Amendment to IFRS 16- COVID-19- Related Rent Concessions (effective date 1 June 2020).

    - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—
Phase 2 (effective date 1 January 2021).

    - Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective date
1 January 2022).

    - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS 3 (effective date 1 January
2022).

    - Amendments to IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment—Proceeds before Intended Use
(effective date 1 January 2022).

    - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 (effective date 1 January 2022).

    - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (effective date 1 January 2023).

    - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as
Current or Non-current (effective date 1 January 2023).

**Restatement of comparatives**

The Group has revised its calculation of deferred tax assets in relation to unfunded defined benefit
pension plan liabilities in Germany to comply with the requirements of IAS 12. The revised calculations
have resulted in a restatement of prior year comparatives for deferred tax assets and other reserves included
in equity. The restatement has led to a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in other reserves
deficit of €71.6m as at January 1, 2018. The effect of this restatement is summarised in the table below:

**2. OPERATING SEGMENTS**

The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the business units for which
information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group has three reportable
segments, as described below.

The Group’s Olefins and Polymers business units produce olefins and related products and a broad
range of polymers. The Group’s olefins businesses are focused on ethylene and propylene, which are the
two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. These olefins are primarily used
as feedstock for the Group’s polymers business. In addition, the Group sells olefins to third party customers
for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including plastics, rubber and fibre.

    - O&P North America segment—In North America, the group’s Olefins and Polymers business
comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas.

    - O&P Europe segment—In Europe, the Group owns and operates two major cracker complexes,
in Köln, Germany and Rafnes, Norway. This includes polymers and derivatives units.

    - Chemical Intermediates—This reportable segment is the aggregation, in compliance with IFRS
8, of a number of different business units with similar economic and other characteristics. Chemical
Intermediates are high-value added chemical products used as key components in a variety of
consumer and industrial products. The Group’s chemical intermediates businesses are exposed to
similar key commodities, namely oil and gas. They produce a range of products including
phenol, alpha olefins, solvents, industrial chemicals and nitriles. The Chemical Intermediates
processes are similar in that they are all capital intensive and based upon processing and mixing
chemical raw materials to produce chemical products for the next stage along the value chain. The
Chemical Intermediates products are distributed on a business-to-business basis across the
world. This is performed using similar conventional methods of pipeline, truck, rail or ship
container depending on the customer location and size of the order. The Chemical Intermediates
customer base is similar in that the customers are generally manufacturers of consumer and
industrial products in developed markets and mature industrial economies.

The accounting policies of all of the reportable segments are as described in Note 1.

Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included in the following
tables. Performance is measured based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and
exceptional items, measured under IFRS (“Segment EBITDA”). A reconciliation to IFRS profit before tax is
presented in the following tables. Segment EBITDA is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to
other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length
basis. Information regarding segments reviewed by management includes management accounts comprising
the profit or loss, cash flows and other financial and non-financial information used to manage the
business.

In presenting information on the basis of geographic analysis of segments, segment revenue is
based on the geographical location of customers and geographical locations from which the Group derives
revenues.

Revenues from external customers for each product and service or each group of similar products
and services and a geographic analysis of segment assets are not presented as the necessary information is
not available and the Directors are of the opinion that the cost to develop it would be excessive.

All businesses within the group typically sell individual cargos based on agreed price with delivery
from the plant or at the customer premise. As such, the revenue is recognised as title passes, at a point in
time, and there are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time. No significant
contract balances arise. No costs to obtain or fulfil contracts are incurred, and therefore no related assets
arise.

**3. ACQUISITIONS**

**_Acquisition of subsidiaries in the current year_**

**Gemini**

On December 31, 2020, the Group acquired 50% of the ordinary shares in Gemini HDPE LLC
(“Gemini”) from Sasol Chemicals North America LLC for cash consideration of $223.8 million
(€187.3 million). The principal activity of the company is to produce high density polyethylene in La Porte,
Texas, USA under tolling arrangements with its owners who provide the feedstock and pay a fee for this
service. The acquisition increased the Group’s interest in Gemini to 100%. Prior to the acquisition the Group
reflected its 50% interest in Gemini as a joint venture (see Note 12a).

As Gemini HDPE LLC is a toll manufacturer on behalf of its owners the overall direct impact on
the Group revenue and profit and loss had the acquisition occurred at the start of the year is immaterial.

**Difference between consideration and provisional net assets acquired . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **138.8**

The fair values disclosed are provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the preparation
of these financial statements so further work may be required to confirm final fair values. The finalisation
of the work to determine the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will be completed within
12 months of the acquisition date.

The difference between consideration and provisional net assets acquired has been recognised as
goodwill within intangible assets (see Note 11) and has arisen because of the expected synergies and the
ability of the Group to market the full output of Gemini. The goodwill has been allocated to the O&P North
America reporting segment and is deductible for tax purposes over a period of 15 years.

_Settlement of pre-existing contractual relationship_

INEOS and Gemini are parties to four pre-existing agreements namely, a tolling agreement, a
ground lease, a licensing agreement and an operating contract. At the acquisition date these pre-existing
relationships were effectively settled as part of the acquisition.

The fair value of the agreements at the acquisition date was nil, and consequently there is no
adjustment to the consideration paid or income or cost associated with the settlement of the relationship
reflected in the Group financial statements.

_Acquisition related costs_

The Group did not incur any acquisition related costs in connection with the transaction.

Prior to the acquisition date, the Group’s interest in the Gemini joint venture was accounted for in
accordance with the equity method of accounting. As a result of the acquisition the previously held interest
of 50% has been disposed of for a fair value of €187.3 million ($223.8 million), being the equivalent of the
value paid to Sasol for their 50% shareholding. Therefore, the gain on the previously held equity interest in
Gemini has been calculated as follows:

**_Updates to prior years_**

**WL Plastics**

On November 1, 2016 the Group acquired 100% of the shares of WLP Holding Corporation, one
of the largest high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe manufacturers in North America for an initial
consideration of €162.1 million. The business is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas with production
facilities in Kentucky, South Dakota, Utah, Texas, and Wyoming. WL Plastics has over 500 million pounds
of annual production capacity and provides HDPE pipe for use in oil, gas, industrial, mining, conduit,
and municipal water and sewer applications. This acquisition forms part of the O&P North America segment.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group paid a further €15.6 million (2019:
€15.0 million, 2018: €7.4 million) which was the final instalment of the contingent consideration which was
subject to the acquired business achieving certain targets over a three year period.

**_Acquisition of subsidiaries in prior years_**

**INESCO combined heat and power plant**

On March 1, 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of RWE Generation Belgium NV, the
owner of a Cogeneration unit on the Oxide Antwerp site in Belgium for cash consideration of €70.4 million.
The business consists of two 50MW units and an additional 35MW steam generator. All the steam and
approximately one third of the electricity is consumed by the Group and a number of co-siting companies
on the site in Antwerp. The remainder of the electricity is sold to the Belgian electricity grid, through a short
term marketing contract with the previous owner RWE. This acquisition forms part of the Chemical
Intermediates segment and is defined as a business under IFRS 3.

For the ten month period since March 1, 2019, the acquired business contributed revenue of
€123.5 million and an EBITDA of €14.3 million. If the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019,
management estimates that the business would have contributed revenues of €148.5 million and EBITDA
of €17.1 million.

**_Acquisition of assets in prior years_**

**Shale oil and gas assets**

In April 2019 the Group purchased 104 active oil and gas wells and three non-active oil and gas
wells located in the Giddings Fields in Texas USA. In addition to the purchase of the wells the Group
acquired all acreage associated with each well. The total cash consideration for the assets was €27.2 million
which included €24.4 million in respect of intangible well rights, €2.6 million relating to property, plant
and equipment and €0.2 million relating to inventories.

**_Exceptional cost of sales_**

The Group has recognised an exceptional impairment charge of €118.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020 in relation to plant and equipment following the Group’s decision to terminate work on
a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated infrastructure at its site in Antwerp, Belgium (see Note 10).

**_Exceptional administrative expenses_**

An exceptional administrative charge of €8.9 million has been charged during 2020, which related
to a provision for early retirement costs as part of a restructuring of the Koln site within the O&P Europe
business.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. Poor operating performance and uneconomic capital expenditure requirements to meet safety
and environmental obligations led to the decision. As a result, an exceptional administrative charge of
€35.1 million was incurred in 2019 for closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses, together
with decommissioning and demolition costs. In addition, tangible fixed assets at the facility of €33.3 million
were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2019 along with a further €26.2 million impairment
charge in the year ended December 31, 2020 (see Note 10).

An exceptional administrative charge of €13.0 million was also incurred during 2019 relating to the
settlement of an intellectual property dispute in respect of the former Technologies business.

**_Exceptional finance costs_**

In April 2019 following the early redemption of the Senior Secured Notes due 2023, an exceptional
finance cost of €11.7 million was recognised which included an early prepayment premium of €7.7 million
and the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with the redeemed Notes of €4.0 million.

Included in 2020 is an exceptional impairment charge of €118.5 million of plant and equipment
following the Group’s decision to terminate work on a propane dehydrogenation unit and associated
infrastructure at its site in Antwerp, Belgium (see Note 4).

During the year a further impairment charge of €26.2 million (2019: €33.3 million) was made in
respect of tangible fixed assets at the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United Kingdom following a decision to
close the site in December 2019 due to poor operating performance and uneconomic capital expenditure
requirements to meet safety and environmental obligations (see Note 4).

**_Leased plant and machinery_**

The Group leases many assets including land and buildings, vessels, storage and transportation
infrastructure, machinery and IT equipment which are classified as right-of-use assets. Prior to 1 January
2019 net book values of €3.6 million in 2018 were included in land and buildings and plant, equipment,
fixture and fittings in respect of assets held under hire purchase and finance leases.

**11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)**

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units (CGU) or groups of cash generating units as
follows:

**2020** **2019** **2018**
**€m**
O&P Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 246.2 246.2 246.2

Chemical Intermediates . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 80.5 80.5 80.5
**Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **790.1** **681.9** **675.9**

The recoverable amount is based on the value in use of each CGU based on the latest board
approved five year plan. The forecasts are based on current performance and management’s assumptions
regarding the future development of individual parameters including raw material prices and profit margins,
utilising available market pricing forecasts. Future assumptions regarding market demand are based on
external macroeconomic sources and specific data relevant to the petrochemical industry and management’s
knowledge of the local markets in which it operates.

The cash flows after the plan period are based on an average of each of the years in the five year
plan to take account of the cyclical nature of the industry extrapolated using long term growth rates as set
out in the table below.

No impairment charge has been recorded in these financial statements as a result of the annual
impairment test.

The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for all CGUs are shown below:

**2020** **2019** **2018**
Period on which management approved forecasts are based . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years 5 years 5 years
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.5% 8.5% 8.5%
Growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0% 3.0% 3.0%

A terminal value is calculated based on the average cash flows over the five year forecasting period
assuming compound growth of 3% and is discounted over the expected lives of the assets of 40 years.

When determining the discount rate the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group is
considered at each respective period end.

The growth rate used includes inflationary growth across our various markets.

The estimated recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount for all cash generating units.

Sensitivity analysis on the recoverable amount was performed based on a 1% change in the discount
rate and a 1% change in the growth rate, both of which are considered a reasonable possible change in
estimate. Neither of these changes resulted in the recoverable amount being lower than the carrying amount.

**_Joint ventures_**

On July 1, 2011 the group restructured the Refining business into a new joint venture between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (‘II(J)L’), a related party. II(J)L is held under
common control by our controlling shareholders. The consideration received by the Group for the disposal
consisted of cash consideration of $1.015 billion received from PetroChina for a 50% interest in the
business and an investment in non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L for the other 50% interest in the business.

The Group retains an economic interest in the Refining business by virtue of its investment in
II(J)L. The results of the Refining business are reported within the share of profit/(loss) of associates and
joint ventures using the equity accounting method by virtue of the Group’s effective control of II(J)L. The
Group has no ongoing obligations to fund the Refining business.

In July 2014 the Group set up a new joint venture entity (Gemini HDPE LLC) with Sasol to build
and operate an HDPE plant at the Battleground site in Texas, USA. The Gemini plant became fully
operational in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018 €12.9 million was invested into the joint venture. On
December 31, 2020 the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture to become the
100% owner of the plant which has resulted in the disposal of the Group’s previous 50% equity accounted
interest of €109.0 million and a gain on disposal of €78.3 million (see Note 3).

In October 2020 the group invested €1.6 million into a joint venture set up with a Chinese partner
to jointly develop Acrylonitrile technology for use within the Chinese market, and to protect against misuse of technology where appropriate.

Before being disposed the Group held a non-voting preferred partnership interest in INEOS
Investments Partnership, an entity held under common control by the Group’s ultimate shareholders, which
owned 24% of the share capital of the PQ Corporation, a silicas business incorporated in the USA and
listed on the New York stock exchange. The Group previously held this investment at amortised cost under
IAS 39; however in 2018 as a result of IFRS 9 it was designated as a financial asset at fair value through
profit or loss. The remeasurement of this investment under IFRS 9 resulted in an adjustment to opening
equity of €6.1 million as at January 1, 2018.

In 2019 the Group disposed of its preferential interest in INEOS Investments Partnership following
the sale by INEOS Investments Partnership of its assets (shares in PQ Corporation) to INEOS Limited, a
related party, for €260.5 million ($296.5 million) which resulted in a profit on disposal of €2.6 million.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit
through future taxable profits is probable based on an assessment of expected future profits modelled
against the gross tax losses. The Group did not recognise gross deductible temporary or tax losses of
€123.8 million (2019: €95.9 million, 2018: €12.0 million) due to uncertainty in respect of the timing realisation.
As at 31 December 2020 there are also unprovided foreign tax credits of €32.7 million.

The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its overseas
subsidiaries or joint ventures as the Group can control the timing and realisation of these temporary
differences, and it is probable that no material unprovided tax liability would arise.

**18. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (continued)**

customers (see Note 25.c). At December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 there were no significant trade, related
party or other receivable balances not past due that were subsequently impaired.

Due to the global activities and diversified customer structure of the Group, there is no significant
concentration of credit risk (2019: nil, 2018: nil).

During 2018, 2019 and 2020 there were no significant trade, related party or other receivable
balances that were subject to renegotiation of terms. Credit enhancements are held in respect of trade and
other receivables in the form of €nil (2019: €nil, 2018: €9.0 million) of assets pledged as security against
amounts owed to the Group of which €nil (2019: €nil, 2018: €3.9 million) is in respect of amounts falling
overdue.

Trade receivable balances totalling €776.4 million (2019: €770.0 million, 2018: €921.2 million) have
been pledged as security against amounts drawn down under the Receivables Securitisation Facility,
described in Note 19, totalling €114.2 million (2019: €297.1 million, 2018: €287.8 million). In accordance
with IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ the trade receivable balances pledged as security do not qualify for
derecognition and are included within the trade receivable balances above.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was
as follows:

Balance at 1 January . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.5 16.9 37.9

The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record any impairment losses unless the
Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is probable; at that point the amounts considered
irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly. As of January 1, 2018, IFRS 9 replaced the
‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model in assessing the
recoverability of trade receivables. Due to the quality of the Group’s trade receivables, and its low history of
bad debts the application of IFRS 9 did not result in a material change to the allowance for impairment in
respect of trade receivables. The impact was calculated considering past experience and management’s estimate
of future developments including the assessment of probability of default being relatively low. Management
expects no considerable change in the future market situation. Consequently, the future credit losses in
the ECL model are in the same range as the credit losses experienced in the past years. This is regarded as
the future expectation of the inherent credit risk of the not impaired trade and other receivables outstanding.
The Group reviews the assumptions of the ECL model on a yearly basis.

The credit risk grade is based on the analysis on both the quantitative and qualitative factors as
detailed below:

    - High: Customers under significant financial difficulty and customers for whom there is an
uncertainty of payment based on knowledge of factors like insolvency, dispute. Any receivable
more than 180 days past due should also be classified in this category.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**18. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (continued)**

    - Medium: Any receivable between 90 and 180 days past due should be classified as medium risk
unless qualitative factors indicate a higher credit risk.

    - Low: Any receivable less than 90 days past due should be classified as low risk unless qualitative
factors indicate a higher credit risk.

During the year the Group has not experienced a significant deterioration in the quality of
receivable balances due to the current economic conditions.

There were no allowances made against amounts due from other receivables during the year (2019:
€nil, 2018: €nil).

There were no allowances made against amounts due from related parties during the year (2019:
€nil, 2018: €nil).

The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and
France.

The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit plans were carried out as follows:

**Plan** **Country** **Valuation date**
All Plans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . United Kingdom 5 April 2019 and 31 December 2019

These valuations have been updated where appropriate to December 31, 2020 by independent
qualified actuaries.

The Group’s pension schemes have been disclosed on a geographical basis as those schemes in the
United Kingdom, North America and Other European. Other European principally includes the Group’s
pension plans in Germany, Belgium, Norway, France and Switzerland.

The UK defined benefit pension plans were historically final salary in nature, with a normal
retirement age of 60. The majority of the UK plans are either closed to new entrants, or frozen to future
accrual. The plans operate under trust law and are managed and administered by Trustees in accordance with
the terms of each plan’s Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The contributions paid to the UK
plans are set every three years based on a funding agreement between the company and Trustee after taking
actuarial advice.

The North American pension arrangements consist of two funded plans, both closed to new
entrants and future accrual. Both plans were final salary defined benefit in nature, and the plans’ liabilities
are valued regularly in line with US statutory funding requirements. Around 90% of both plans’ assets are
invested in bond instruments, to closely match the profile of each plans’ liabilities.

The Other European pension arrangements are primarily final salary in nature, the majority of
which remain open to new entrants. The Norwegian and Swiss benefits are insured, the Belgian plan assets
are held in trust, and the remaining schemes are unfunded with associated provisions held on the Group’s
balance sheet.

**_Post-retirement health care plans_**

The Group also operates a number of post-retirement healthcare plans in the United States, which
provide employees with other post-employment benefits in respect of health care. The plans are unfunded
and

the liability in respect of these benefits is included in provisions. The liability is assessed by
qualified independent actuaries under the projected unit method, assuming the following rates:

**_Severance and restructuring costs_**

The severance and restructuring costs provision includes €22.1 million relating to the Köln site
following a reorganisation within the O&P North business in 2015 and is expected to be fully utilised by
2027.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. The severance and restructuring costs provision includes €6.1 million in respect of remaining
closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses. The provision is expected to be fully utilised
within the next two years.

**_Remediation costs_**

The Group has provided for the cost of remediation works of €13.5 million where there is a legal
or constructive obligation for such work to be carried out. Provisions are established to meet the clean-up
costs of contaminated soil and groundwater, the removal of potentially hazardous substances and rectification
work required to ensure compliance with license to operate obligations. These costs relate mainly to the
Group’s production facilities at the Köln, Chocolate Bayou, Green Lake and Lima sites and a pilot plant at
the Lavera site. The provision only covers items of specific work for which a reasonable estimate can be
determined. By their nature the amounts and timing of any outflows in respect of remediation costs are
difficult to predict.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. The remediation provision includes €12.8 million in respect of decommissioning and demolition
costs. The provision is expected to be fully utilised within the next two years.

**_Other provisions_**

Other provisions primarily relates to a commercial disputes in respect of a licencing agreement and
are expected to be fully utilised within the next three years.

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**25a Fair value of financial instruments**

**_Investments in debt and equity securities_**

The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (previously other investments)
is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are accounted for at fair value
based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily available based on the
present value of future cash flows estimated from financial information made available during the year as a
result of a recent transaction in the investment. However, as explained in Note 14, the Group’s financial
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include certain equity interests which are not quoted
and for which there is no active market. The Group considers that the acquisition cost to be a reasonable
approximation for fair value.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other receivables generally approximates to fair value due to
their short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair
value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

**_Trade and other payables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other payables generally approximates to fair value due to their
short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair value is
estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting
date.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is
repayable on demand. Where it is not repayable on demand then the fair value is estimated at the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

**_Interest-bearing borrowings_**

The fair value of the Senior Secured Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes, which
after initial recognition is determined for disclosure purposes only are based on the market yields derived
from quotes obtained at the year end from leading financial institutions. The fair value of the Receivables and
Inventory Securitisation, Rafnes Facility, Schuldschein Loan, Koln CoGen Facility, Gemini Facility and
Other loans is the same as the carrying value before unamortised debt issue costs.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

The fair value of interest rate swaps and commodity contracts are based on market or broker
quotes.

The commodity derivatives are fair valued using rates in a quoted market. There have been no
transfers between any levels in 2020 (2019 and 2018: no transfers between levels).

**25b Net gains and losses from financial instruments**

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the results of valuations, the amortisation
of discounts, the recognition and derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign
currencies, interest, dividends and all effects on profit or loss of financial instruments.

Net gains from financial assets measured at amortised cost relate primarily to recognition and
derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign currencies and interest income.

Net losses from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost relate primarily to amortisation of
discounts, results from the translation of foreign currencies, interest expense and other financing related
expenses.

The item ‘financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss’ comprise valuation gains and
losses, and only includes gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments
as defined by IFRS 9.

**25c Credit risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, deposits with financial institutions and derivatives.

Group Treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimize the likelihood that the
Group will experience financial loss due to counterparty failure and to ensure that in the event of a single
loss, the failure of any single counterparty would not materially impact the financial wellbeing of the Group.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group’s customer base, including
the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an
influence on credit risk. Management considers that there is no geographical concentration of credit risk.
The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for
creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are
adjusted accordingly. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases
bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open
amount without requiring approval. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness
may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.

**_Investments, cash and cash equivalent_**

Surplus cash investments are only made with banks with which the Group has a relationship.

**_Guarantees_**

The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2020 no guarantees were outstanding (2019: none, 2018: none).

**_Exposure to credit risk_**

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was the carrying amount of financial assets. Further
details on the Group’s exposure to credit risk are given in Note 18.

**25d Liquidity risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by the
fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short,
medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.

The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary
company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget.

The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and
monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at
bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a

For the year ended December 31, 2020 losses net of tax of €527.4 million were taken directly to
reserves and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended (2019: gains
€88.0 million, 2018: gains €271.3 million). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019: €nil, 2018: €nil). The cumulative net investment hedge reserve
amount as at December 31, 2020 was €(36.5) million (2019: €490.9 million, 2018: €402.9 million).

**25f Market risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Market risk reflects the possibility that changes in market prices, such as crude oil, feedstock
refined products, chemicals or currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates will adversely affect the
value of the Group’s assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Group holds commodity contracts
in order to manage market risk. The use of derivative instruments is confined to specialist teams that have
the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.

**_Market risk—Foreign currency risk_**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the U.S. Dollar and Sterling.

Foreign exchange risk arises from net investments in foreign operations, future commercial
transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities.

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of
a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. When the settlement of
a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the
foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item is considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and changes in the fair value are recognised directly
within equity.

A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar and the
euro. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs
are denominated in euro and sterling. In the U.S. petrochemical and specialty chemicals businesses, product
prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Group generally does not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge foreign
currency transaction exposure, although the Group has done so in the past and may do so in the future.

The Group benefits from natural hedging, to the extent that currencies in which net cash flows are
generated from the Group’s operations, are matched against long-term indebtedness.

The foreign currency exposure where the Group’s external financial assets/(liabilities) are not
denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved is shown below. Foreign exchange
differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the other comprehensive income of the
Group.

A 1% change in the opposite direction of the above interest rates at December 31, would have had
the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all
other variables remain constant.

**Market risk—Commodity price risk**

This section discusses the Group’s exposure to the commodity contracts which are not covered
under the own use exemption and are recognised as derivative instruments.

The Group and its Refining joint venture are exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations
in raw material prices and sales of products. The raw material exposures result primarily from the price of
crude oil and base chemicals linked to the price of crude. The sales price exposures are primarily related to
petrochemicals where prices are in general linked to the market price of crude oil.

The Group enters into contracts to supply or acquire physical volumes of commodities at future
dates during the normal course of business that may be considered derivative contracts. Where such
contracts exist and are in respect of the normal purchase or sale of products to fulfil the Group’s
requirements, the own use exemption from derivative accounting is applied.

The Group manages commodity price exposures through trading refined products and chemical
feedstock and using commodity swaps, options and futures as a means of managing price and timing risks.
In 2020 there was a net mark to market derivative liability in respect of commodity contracts of
€57.6 million entered into by the Group to manage such risk (2019: net derivative liability of €44.2 million,
2018: net derivative asset of €9.7 million).

The Group operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those
relating to the default of counterparties, are minimised.

**_Market risk—Equity price risk_**

The Group’s exposure to equity price risk arises from its investment in equity securities which are
classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial assets are
accounted for at fair value based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily
available.

For the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income a 10 percent increase and
decrease in transaction prices at the reporting date would have decreased and increased the loss for the year
by €2.8 million (2019: €2.8 million, 2018: €2.8 million). Management consider that a change of 10 percent
gives an appropriate benchmark to assess the risks that the Group is expected to be exposed to. This calculation
assumes that the change occurred at the reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at
that date. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Group defines its capital employed of €7,701.2 million (2019: €7,326.3 million, 2018:
€7,077.2 million) as shareholders’ equity of €1,461.6 million (2019: €1,456.4 million, 2018: €2,845.9 million)
and net debt (net of debt issue costs) of €6,239.6 million (2019: €5,869.9 million, 2018: €4,231.3 million).

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

The principal sources of debt available to the Group at December 31, 2020 include the Senior
Secured Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes due March 2026, Senior Secured Notes due May 2026, Senior
Secured Notes due 2025, Senior Notes due 2024, Receivables Securitisation Facility, Inventory Financing
Facility, Schuldschein Loan, Rafnes Facility, Koln CoGen Facility and the Gemini Facility and are

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends
paid to shareholders, issue new shares, raise new debt or sell assets to reduce debt. The ability of the Group
to pay dividends and provide appropriate facilities to the Group is restricted by the terms of principal
financing agreements to which members of the Group are party.

**29. RELATED PARTIES (continued)**

€88.0 million, 2018: €85.7 million) were charged to the income statement. As at December 31, 2020 there
were no amounts owed to INEOS AG (2019: €23.1 million, 2018: €22.0 million). As at December 31, 2020
there were no amounts owed to INEOS Holdings AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of INEOS AG (2019:
€0.9 million, 2018: nil). As at December 31, 2020 amounts owed by INEOS Holdings AG were €28.3 million
(2019: nil, 2018: €0.4 million).

In March 2019 the Group received €260.5 million of proceeds in relation to the repayment of the
Group’s preferential interest in INEOS Investments Partnership following the sale by INEOS Investments
Partnership of its assets (shares in PQ Corporation) to INEOS Limited. The Group paid the proceeds received
as part of a dividend of €296.3 million to its parent company, INEOS Holdings Luxembourg S.A..

INEOS Limited owns and controls a number of operating subsidiaries that are not included in
the INEOS Group Holdings S.A. group, including INEOS Industries Limited (which from December 31,
2020 includes INOVYN Limited and from September 1, 2017 includes the Grangemouth petrochemical
subsidiaries), INEOS Enterprises Holdings Limited and the Lavéra petrochemical assets and businesses
together with other French and Italian assets of INEOS O&P South.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group has made sales to these subsidiaries of
€1,044.7 million (2019: €1,316.1 million, 2018: €1,528.9 million), recovered net costs of €141.4 million
(2019: €77.9 million, 2018: €115.0 million) and made purchases of €1,031.3 million (2019: €1,315.2 million,
2018: €1,489.1 million). As at December 31, 2020, €374.2 million (2019: €471.1 million, 2018: €465.0 million)
was owed by and €177.4 million (2019: €154.0 million, 2018: €115.1 million) was owed to these subsidiaries
(excluding the Grangemouth shareholder loan and the INEOS Upstream Limited loan).

During 2015 the Group provided a loan of $623.7 million to INEOS Upstream Limited, a related
party, in connection with its acquisition of natural gas assets in the North Sea. The loan facility is unsecured
and matures in June 2024 and bears interest at 7% per annum. On September 29, 2017, INEOS Upstream
Limited, a related party, acquired further natural gas assets in the North Sea through its acquisition of the
entire oil and gas business of DONG Energy A/S. In connection with the DONG Acquisition, the Group
advanced a loan of $376.2 million (€315.7 million) to INEOS Upstream Limited, the proceeds of which were
on lent to certain of its subsidiaries. The loan is unsecured and matures in June 2024 and bears interest at
7% per annum. There were no loan repayments during 2020 (2019: nil, 2018: net loan repayments of
$122.5 million (€105.4 million)). As at December 31, 2020 $617.1 million (€501.7 million) (2019: $617.1 million
(€550.8 million), (2018: $617.1 million (€539.7 million)) was outstanding under the facility.

Following the divestment of the Grangemouth petrochemical business in 2013 the Group put in
place a €200 million shareholder loan facility to fund the ongoing operations and investments required at
the site. In July 2019 INEOS Grangemouth plc entered in to a new €350.0 million Senior Term Loan and
Revolving Credit facility and the shareholder loan facility was cancelled in full.

INEOS Limited owns interests in a number of joint ventures that are not included in the INEOS
Group Holdings S.A. group, including the French joint ventures associated with the Lavera petrochemical
assets and businesses which were divested by the Group on July 1, 2014 and the refining joint ventures between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited, a related party. Previous to becoming a fully owned
subsidiary on December 31, 2020 (see Note 3) the Group had a joint venture with Sasol Limited to build and
operate a HDPE plant at Battleground site in Texas, USA which became operational at the end of 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group made sales of €0.1 million (2019: €0.1 million,
2018: €0.1 million), recovered costs of €0.2 million (2019: €0.5 million, 2018: nil) and made purchases of
€0.2 million (2019: €0.2 million, 2018: nil) from the French joint ventures. As at December 31, 2020
€0.1 million (2019: €0.3 million, 2018: €0.1 million) was owed by the French joint ventures and no amount
(2019: €0.2 million, 2018: nil) was owed to the French joint ventures.

The Refining joint ventures are between PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited, a
related party. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Group made sales to the Refining joint
ventures of €1.4 million (2019: nil, 2018: €0.6 million), recovered costs of €8.4 million (2019: €8.6 million,
2018: €5.4 million) and made purchases of €145.7 million (2019: €221.4 million, 2018: €379.3 million). As at

**29. RELATED PARTIES (continued)**

December 31, 2020, €1.2 million (2019: €0.8 million, 2018: €1.4 million) was owed by the Refining joint
ventures and €2.0 million (2019: €25.5 million, 2018: €21.2 million) was owed to the Refining joint ventures.

During 2020 before the HDPE joint venture became a fully owned subsidiary of the Group on
December 31, 2020 (see Note 3) the Group made no sales to the HDPE joint venture (2019: nil, 2018:
€5.6 million), recovered costs of €60.5 million (2019: €59.1 million, 2018: €58.4 million) and made purchases
of €43.6 million (2019: €47.9 million, 2018: nil) from the HDPE joint venture. As at December 31, 2019,
€5.6 million was owed by and €5.1 million was owed to (2018: €5.1 million was owed by) the HDPE joint
venture.

The Group has entered into a number of derivative contracts with INEOS UK SNS Limited and
INEOS Energy Trading Limited, both related parties. The net fair value loss on these derivatives during the
year ended December 31, 2020 was €126.2 million (2019: €80.3 million). As at December 31, 2020, the
mark to market derivative asset was €17.8 million (2019: €15.3 million) and the mark to market liability was
€88.0 million (2019: €54.5 million) in respect of these related party derivative financial instruments (see
Note 15).

**_Compensation to key management personnel (including directors)_**

The Group defines key management as the directors of the Company. Details of Directors’
remuneration are given in Note 7.

**30. ULTIMATE PARENT UNDERTAKING AND CONTROLLING PARTY**

The immediate parent undertaking is INEOS Holdings Luxembourg S.A.. The ultimate parent
undertaking at December 31, 2020 was INEOS Limited, a company registered in the Isle of Man. The
ultimate controlling party is Mr JA Ratcliffe, director and majority shareholder of the ultimate parent
undertaking. INEOS Group Holdings S.A. and its subsidiaries are not included within any other consolidated
financial statements.

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, which require
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect the application of the accounting
policies, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates change and in any future periods.

**Critical accounting judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The key accounting judgement taken in the preparation of these financial statements relates to our
interest in the refining business formerly owned by Group (see Note 12). The refining business is now
owned by PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (“II(J)L”), which in turn is held under
common control by the Group’s controlling Shareholders. The Group has an economic interest in II(J)L
via non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L.

The Group has evaluated its interest in II(J)L and in the refining business, and has concluded that
it has effective control over II(J)L by virtue of the facts that the Group is subject to exposure and rights to
the variable returns from II(J)L, II(J)L is held under common control with the Group’s controlling shareholder
and has the same directors as the Group. As a result, II(J)L is treated as a subsidiary of the Group, and
therefore the refining business is treated as a joint venture under the equity accounting method, and the
company reflects its 50% share in the profits and losses of the refining business in its income statement. (see
also Note 1, Accounting policies).

**Key sources of estimated uncertainty**

Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that the
Group believe are reasonable, including assets and expected economic conditions, and in certain cases


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2020**
_(forming part of the financial statements)_

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)**

actuarial assumption. Although these estimates are based on the Group’s knowledge of current events and
circumstances, actual numbers may differ.

**_Taxation_**

Management is required to estimate the tax payable in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. This involves estimating the actual current tax charge or credit together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The calculation of the
Group’s total tax charge necessarily involves a significant degree of estimation in respect of certain items

whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the
relevant tax authority, or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.

The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate
transactions in the countries in which it operates. After appropriate consideration, management makes
provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which
is reliably measurable.

The breadth of the Group’s structure with operations in many geographic locations makes the use
of estimates and assumptions more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of
the Group and can be reliant upon the efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant jurisdictions in
which the Group operates, and as a result, issues can, and often do take many years to resolve.

Details of amounts recognised with regard to taxation are disclosed in Notes 9 and 16. Note 9 shows
tax adjustments in respect of prior years of €105.0 million which primarily relates to the carry back of
losses, although material adjustments may arise in future years.

**_Defined benefit obligations_**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post employment schemes. Under IAS 19 Revised
Employee Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined benefit
obligation of each of the defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined benefit
schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve making numerous
assumptions, with the most significant being:

     - Inflation rate projections;

     - Discount rate for scheme liabilities; and

     - Mortality levels.

The assumptions are based on the environment in each country and vary year to year, with
changes impacting net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the
discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the Group’s postretirement benefit obligations within the next financial year. Any differences between these assumptions
and the actual outcome will impact future net income and net assets.

Details of post-retirement benefits and sensitivity to each significant assumption are set out in
Note 21.

**AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

To the Shareholders of
**Ineos Group Holdings S.A.**

**REPORT OF THE REVISEUR D’ENTREPRISES AGREE**

**Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

_Opinion_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Ineos Group Holdings S.A. and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at
December 31, 2019 and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of
changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended and notes to the
consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of
the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019 and its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (Law
of 23 July 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the
“Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under the Law of
23 July 2016 and ISAs are further described in the “Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé”
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements”section of our report. We are also independent of the
Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements, and have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Other information**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information stated in the consolidated annual report including management report but does not include
the consolidated financial statements and our report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé” thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we
do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read
the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to
be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report in
this regard.

**Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements**

The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal
control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


-----

**AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé” for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a
report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé” that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level
of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016
and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for
Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:

     - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.

     - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.

    - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.

    - Conclude on the appropriateness of Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our report of the “Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé” to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report of the
“Réviseur d’Entreprises Agréé”. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to
cease to continue as a going concern.

     - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the
underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

     - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement
that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with
them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and
where applicable, related safeguards.

**Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements**

The consolidated management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

referred to as the “Group”) and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and joint ventures.

The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and approved by the
directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union in response to the IAS regulation (EC 1606/2002) effective as of December 31, 2019 and
have been approved for issuance by the Board of Directors on March 20, 2020.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all
periods presented in these Group financial statements.

**Measurement convention**

The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial
instruments, financial instruments and financial assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss or
fair value through other comprehensive income which are stated at their fair value.

**Functional and presentation currency**

These Group financial statements are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the
majority of operations, with other significant currencies being USD and Sterling. The Group’s primary
products are sold in an international commodities market which is priced and invoiced primarily in euros.

All financial information presented in euro has been rounded to the nearest €0.1 million.

**Changes in accounting policies**

The Group financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies with the
those of the previous financial year. From January 1, 2019 the Group has applied IFRS 16 Leases for the
first time along with a number of other new standards, although only IFRS 16 has had a material effect on
the Group’s financial statements.

**_IFRS 16 Leases_**

IFRS 16 replaces previous leasing guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining
_whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases—Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the_
_Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease._

IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises
a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its
obligation to make lease payments. These liabilities are measured at the present value of the remaining lease
payments, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or if that is not available the lessee’s incremental
borrowing rate.

For leases in which the Group is a lessor, no significant impact has arisen. Lessor accounting in
_IFRS 16 Leases remains similar to the previous standard IAS 17 Leases, with lessors continuing to classify_
leases as finance or operating leases.

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

The Group has applied IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, using the ‘modified retrospective approach’
without restatement of comparative information. The details of the changes in accounting policies are
disclosed below.

_i)_ _Adjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 in which the Group is a lessee_

The Group has recognised new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for lease contracts previously
classified as operating leases, which include vessels, storage and transportation infrastructure. The nature of
expenses related to those leases has changed because the Group recognises a depreciation charge for rightof-use assets and interest expense on lease liabilities. Previously, the Group recognised operating lease expense
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and recognised assets and liabilities only to the extent
that there was a timing difference between actual lease payments and the expense recognised. In addition,
the Group no longer recognises provisions for operating leases that it assesses to be onerous. Instead, the
Group now includes the payments due under the lease in its lease liability, and recognises any required
impairment of the corresponding right-of-use asset.

At commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease and non-lease component,
the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each component on the basis of its relative standalone price.

On transition lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019. Right-of-use assets are measured
at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments.

The table below provides a reconciliation between operating lease commitments disclosed as at
December 31, 2018 and the lease liability recognised as at January 1, 2019.

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

The change in accounting policy affected the following items in the balance sheet on January 1,
2019:

     - Right-of-use assets—increase of €903.0 million. This includes the leased assets recognised
previously as finance leases of €3.6 million that were reclassified from property, plant and
equipment.

     - Property, plant and equipment—decrease of €3.6 million. This relates to the reclassification of
leased assets, previously recognised as finance leases, to Right-of-use assets.

     - Lease liabilities—increase of €899.4 million. From January 1, 2019 all lease liabilities (including
finance leases recognised as at December 31, 2018) have been categorised within “Lease liabilities”
on the balance sheet.

The net impact on retained earnings on January 1, 2019 was €nil.

_(ii)_ _Practical expedients applied_

The Group had a number of arrangements that were not in the legal form of a lease, for which it
concluded that the arrangement contained a lease under IFRIC 4. On transition to IFRS 16, the Group did
not apply the practical expedient to grandfather the definition of a lease on transition. Therefore, the new
definition of a lease under IFRS 16 has been applied to all of the contracts in place on transition.

When applying the modified retrospective approach to leases previously classified as operating leases
under IAS 17, the Group has elected to apply the following practical expedients:

     - the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics,

    - reliance on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous,

     - the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at
1 January 2019 as short-term leases,

     - the accounting for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less as short-term leases. The Group
did not recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for these short-term leases. The lease
payments associated with them will be recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the
lease term,

     - the accounting for leases, for which the underlying asset is of low value when it is new, as low
value leases, The Group did not recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for these low-value
leases. The lease payments associated with them will be recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term,

     - the exclusion of initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of
initial application, and

    - the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend
or terminate the lease.

_(iii)_ _Adjustments in respect of leases where the Group is a lessee and the leases were previously classified as_
_finance leases under IAS 17_

For leases classified as finance leases under IAS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset
and the lease liability at 1 January 2019 were determined at the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease
liability under IAS 17 immediately before that date.

The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the
comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.
The details of accounting policies under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 are disclosed separately.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Policies applicable from 1 January 2019**

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A
contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for
a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in IFRS 16.

This policy is applied to contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2019.

**_Group as a lessee_**

_Right-of-use assets_

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of rightof-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized and lease payments made at or before the
commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove
the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease
incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying
asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group
will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the
underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition,
the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain
remeasurements of the lease liability.

_Lease liabilities_

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the
present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the interest rate implicit
in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease
payments that depend on an index or a rate (initially measured using the index or rate as at the
commencement date), amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees less any lease incentives
receivable. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be
exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group
exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate
are expensed in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on
the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the
lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a
modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments a change in the
assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset,
a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the
Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way and there has been no change in the scope of the
lease, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded
in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

_Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets_

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to all leases that have a lease term
of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. The Group also


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of assets that are valued below
€10,000. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Policies applicable prior to 1 January 2019**

_Operating lease payments_

Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated income statement on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the consolidated
income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.

_Finance lease payments_

Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the
outstanding liability. The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

**Basis of consolidation**

_Subsidiaries_

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The
Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations, except acquisitions
under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. The consideration transferred for the
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former
owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s
proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the
acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date;
any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the
acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be
an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 in the profit or loss. Contingent consideration
that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group
companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated.

Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions—that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference
between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net
assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are
also recorded in equity.

When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair
value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The


-----

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained
interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in
other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed
of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to profit or loss.

_Special purpose entities (“SPE”)_

An SPE is consolidated if, based on an evaluation of the substance of its relationship with the
Group and the SPE’s risks and rewards, the Group concludes that it controls the SPE. The Group has
established an SPE, Ineos Finance Ireland Limited, for a debt securitisation programme. The Group does
not have any direct or indirect shareholdings in this SPE. Ineos Finance Ireland Limited is controlled by the
Group as it was established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decision-making powers of
the SPE’s management that result in the Group receiving the majority of the benefits related to the SPE’s
operations and net assets, being exposed to the majority of risks arising from the SPE’s activities, and
retaining the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPE and its assets. Ineos Finance
Ireland Limited is therefore regarded as an SPE and has been consolidated in these financial statements.

_Associates_

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally
accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is initially
recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of
the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associates includes
goodwill identified on acquisition. If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant
influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its
share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive
income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s share
of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the
investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the
amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates’ in the income statement.

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and
its associate are recognised in the Group’s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s
interests in the associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

_Joint arrangements_

The Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11 investments in joint
arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights
and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined
them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost
and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and
movements in other comprehensive income. When the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form
part of the Group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the Group does not recognise further losses, unless
it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the
extent of the Group’s interest in the joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction
provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of the joint ventures
have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

**Foreign exchange**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign
exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the
consolidated income statement except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability
designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are
recognised in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of
historical cost in a foreign exchange are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to
the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising
on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational currency, euros, at foreign exchange rates
ruling at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The Group applies an average rate for the year where this rate
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences
arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. They are
recycled into the consolidated income statement upon disposal.

Exchange differences arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign
operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity in the translation
reserve. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of a borrowing designated as a hedge of
a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised directly in OCI, in the translation reserve, to the extent
that the hedge is effective. When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of, the associated cumulative
amount in equity is transferred to profit or loss as an adjustment to the profit or loss on disposal.

**Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group**

Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet
the following two conditions:

(a) They include no contractual obligation upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial
assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and

(b) Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is
either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the
Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its
own equity instruments.

To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial
liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts
presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude
amounts in relation to those shares.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Non-derivative financial instruments**

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and
other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition they are tested for
classification as per IFRS 9. If the trade receivables satisfy the criteria for cash flow characteristics test and
business model test as per IFRS 9, then they are recognised at amortised cost. If they do not qualify for
being recognised at amortised cost they are recognised at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value
through other comprehensive income.

_Trade and other payables_

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised
cost using the effective interest method.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Investments in debt securities are measured at amortised cost if they meet both of the following
conditions and are not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual
cash flows; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

A financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income only if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not designated as a fair value through profit and loss:

     - The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and

     - The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

For investment in equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to
present subsequent changes to fair value in other comprehensive income. The Group makes this election on
an investment-by-investment basis.

All other financial assets, including derivatives, are classified as measured at fair value through
profit and loss. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised
directly in equity is recognised in the income statement. Where these investments are interest-bearing,
interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement. Where no reliable
measurement of fair value is available, investments are stated at historic acquisition cost.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash balances and call deposits.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_

Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

_Debt restructuring_

The Group derecognises financial liabilities in accordance with the provisions in IFRS 9. When
debt is modified, the Group analyses the modifications from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective
to determine if the modifications are substantial and meet the IFRS requirements for de-recognition, in
which case the debt is treated as extinguished. All fees paid in connection with a debt extinguishment are
expensed immediately. When a modification is accounted for as a non-substantial modification, associated
fees incurred are deferred as an adjustment to the carrying value of the liability and amortised using the
effective interest method.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging**

_Derivative financial instruments_

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on subsequent
re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as finance
income or expense. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss
depends on the nature of the item being hedged.

_Cash flow hedges_

Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of
a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss
on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. The effective portion
of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in hedging reserve is limited to the cumulative
change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as
finance income or expense.

Where the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or
non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is
included in the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a
financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into
profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect
profit or loss, e.g. when interest income or expense is recognised.

For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the
associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the consolidated income
statement as an adjustment to revenue and cost of sales in the same period or periods during which the
hedged forecast transaction affects revenue and cost of sales in the consolidated income statement.

When a hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or the hedge no longer meets
the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or
loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction
occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss
recognised in equity is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.

**Hedge of net investment of foreign operation**

The Group applied hedge accounting to foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation
of a foreign currency loan where the loan is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
in accordance with IFRS 9.

Most commonly this means that exchange differences arising on retranslation of foreign currency
loans designated as a net investment hedge are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive


-----

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

income. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to the statement of
comprehensive income when the foreign operation is sold.

When a derivative instrument or a non-derivative financial liability is designated as the hedging
instrument in a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of, for a derivative
changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument or, for a non-derivative, foreign exchange gains and losses
is recognised in OCI and presented in the translation reserve within equity. Any ineffective portion of the
changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is
recognised immediately in the income statement. The amount recognised in OCI is reclassified to the income
statement as a reclassification adjustment on disposal of the foreign operation.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Cost may
include the cost of materials, labour and other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working
condition for their intended use. Cost may also include the cost of dismantling and removing items and
restoring the site on which they are located.

Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

Depreciation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation commences
from the date an asset is brought into service. Land and assets in the course of construction are not
depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

       - Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 40 years

     - Plant and equipment and fixtures and fittings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 40 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where an indicator of
impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s
fair value less cost to sell and value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying value of the asset) is included in the
consolidated income statement in the period in which the item is derecognised.

**Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets**

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the Acquisition method, except
acquisitions under common control which are outside the scope of IFRS 3. Goodwill represents amounts
arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Acquisitions under common control are accounted for at book value. The difference in the book
value of the assets acquired and consideration paid is recognised in retained earnings.

Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups
of cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. The cash generating units
within the Group are predominately business units. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the investee.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated income
statement.

_Intangible assets_

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets principally comprise intellectual property
rights, customer relationships, non-compete agreements and license fees.

Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost. The initial cost is
the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of other consideration given to acquire the assets. An intangible
asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised separately from goodwill if the asset is
separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.

_Amortisation_

Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible
assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

      - Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 - 12 years

      - Intellectual property rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 - 15 years

      - Non-compete agreements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . life of the agreement

      - Licenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . up to 15 years

These intangible assets are tested for impairment at the end of the reporting period if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Useful lives are examined
on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

_Research and development_

Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an expense
as incurred.

Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible and the Group intends to and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to
complete development, future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the
expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan
or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Where
regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is recognised in
the income statement. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense
as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less
accumulated impairment losses.

**Impairment of financial assets**

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group applies the simplified approach when providing for expected credit losses prescribed by
IFRS 9 for its trade receivables and contract assets. This approach requires the Group to recognise the
lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables taking in consideration historical as well as forwardlooking information.

Where the Group has assessed the probability of default of a financial asset to be low, the loss
allowance is considered immaterial.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with the
financial assets classified at amortised cost at each balance sheet date, and adjusts the allowance accordingly.

_Investments in debt and equity securities_

Impairment of equity securities classified as FVOCI are not tested for impairment under IFRS 9.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as FVOCI increases and the increase can be objectively
related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement, the
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

**Impairment of non-financial assets excluding inventories and deferred tax assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax
assets are assessed at the end of the reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of
impairment.

For goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets
that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at the end of the reporting period.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating
unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount
of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or
groups of assets.

_Calculation of recoverable amount_

The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less cost to sell and value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

_Reversals of impairment_

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.

In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the
impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed
the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment
loss had been recognised.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in first-out or average cost method, and
net realisable value which is defined as the estimated selling price less the estimated cost of completion and
the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories,
production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads
based on normal operating capacity. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where
appropriate.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Items owned by the Group that are held on consignment at another entity’s premises are included
as part of the Group’s inventory.

**Commodities**

Contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of
non-financial items in accordance with the Group’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own-use
contracts) are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments, but rather as executory contracts.

**Employee benefits**

The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans and funded and unfunded defined
benefit pension schemes. The Group also provides unfunded early retirement benefits, long service awards
and an incentive plan for certain employees.

The Group provides health care insurance to eligible retired employees and their dependants,
primarily in the United States.

_Defined contribution plans_

A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the
consolidated income statement as incurred.

_Defined benefit plans_

A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post employment benefits
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value, and the fair value of any plan assets (at bid price) are deducted. The liability discount rate is
the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated bonds denominated in the currency of, and that have
maturity dates approximating to the terms of, the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

When the benefits of a plan are amended or curtailed, the portion of the increased or decreased
benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense immediately in the consolidated
income statement.

Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset recognised is limited to the
present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The pension scheme surplus (to the extent that it is recoverable) or deficit is recognised in full.

The movement in the scheme surplus/deficit is split between:

     - cost of sales and administrative expenses,

     - net finance costs and,

    - in net expense recognised directly in equity, the remeasurements of post employment benefit
obligations.

_Short-term benefits_

Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed
as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term
cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this
amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

**Share capital**

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new
shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

**Revenue**

Revenue represents the invoiced value of products and services sold or services provided to third
parties net of sales discounts, value added taxes and duties. Contracts for goods and services are analysed
to determine the distinct performance obligations against which revenue should be recognised. The amount
to be recognised is determined from the standalone selling prices for goods and services, allocated to the
performance obligations. Revenue is recognised when (or as) the performance obligations are satisfied by
transferring a promised good or service to a customer.

The pricing for products sold is determined by market prices (market contracts and arrangements)
or is linked by a formula to published raw material prices plus an agreed additional amount (formula
contracts). Revenue arising from the sale of goods is recognised when the goods are dispatched or delivered
depending on the relevant delivery terms and point at which the control of the good or service is transferred
to the customer.

Services provided to third parties include administrative and operational services provided to other
chemical companies with facilities on our sites and services under tolling arrangements. Under tolling
arrangements, customers pay for or provide raw materials to be converted into certain specified products,
for which the Group charges a toll fee. The Group only recognises toll fee as revenue earned under such
arrangements upon shipment of the converted product to the customer as this is the point at which the
control of the service is transferred to the buyer. For all other services, revenue is recognised at a point in
time. There are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time.

**Government grants**

Government grants are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income. This income is
amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the tangible fixed asset to which it relates or the
life of the related project.

**Finance income and expenses**

Interest income and interest expense are recognised in the consolidated income statement as it
accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated income
statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign exchange gains and losses
are reported on a gross basis.

Finance costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on leases, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, net fair value losses on derivatives, net interest on employee benefit liabilities and foreign
exchange losses that are recognised in the consolidated income statement (see foreign exchange accounting
policy).

Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested and from related party loans, net
fair value gains on derivatives and foreign exchange gains.

**Taxation**

Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the
consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in
which case it is recognised in equity.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following
temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination;
and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the
foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at
the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if it is possible that there is a
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets because they relate to taxes levied by the
same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax
liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will
be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

**Segmental analysis**

The Group determines its operating segments in a manner consistent with the internal reporting
provided to the chief operating decision-makers. The chief operating decision-makers are responsible for
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The chief operating decisionmakers are the members of the Executive Committee of the ultimate parent undertaking, Ineos Limited.

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which
it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with
any of the Group’s other components and for which discrete financial information is available. An operating
segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision-makers to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.

The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is based on business segments. The business
segments are determined based on the Group’s management and internal reporting structure and the
aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8.

Segment results that are reported to the chief operating decision-makers include items directly
attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

Segment capital expenditure is the total payments made during the period to acquire property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets other than as acquired through business combinations.

**Emission trading scheme**

The Group participates in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Scheme encourages companies
to reduce carbon emissions by offering financial incentives if they achieve their annual reduction targets. If
a company reduces emissions beyond their target then the surplus may be traded in the form of emissions
permits.

The incentive money due from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is recognised in the consolidated
income statement once the reduction targets have been met. The emissions permits allocated under the
Scheme are at nil cost. The Group recognises the revenue from such permits upon their sale to third parties.

The Group recognises a provision for emissions produced. The provision is measured at the
carrying amount of the emission rights held (nil if granted, otherwise at cost) or, in the case of a shortfall,
at the current fair value of the emission rights needed.

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)**

**Exceptional items**

In order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating
performance of the Group’s ongoing business it separately identifies those profits and losses which because
of their size or nature, are outside the normal course of business so are expected to be non-recurring.
This may include the disposal of businesses, the impairment of non-current assets, the cost of restructuring
acquired businesses, the impact of one off events such as legal settlements or finance costs relating to call
premia and write-off of unamortised debt issue costs following substantial modification or redemption of
debt as exceptional items.

**Accounting standards not applied**

A number of new accounting standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2020 and earlier application is permitted. However, the Group has not
early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements.

The following new or amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a material
impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

    - Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards.

    - Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3)

    - Definition of Material (Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8)

    - IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts

    - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture
(Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)

    - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7)

**2. OPERATING SEGMENTS**

The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the business units for which
information is reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Group has three reportable
segments, as described below.

The Group’s Olefins and Polymers business units produce olefins and related products and a broad
range of polymers. The Group’s olefins businesses are focused on ethylene and propylene, which are the
two largest volume olefins globally and are key building blocks for polymers. These olefins are primarily used
as feedstock for the Group’s polymers business. In addition, the Group sells olefins to third party customers
for a variety of industrial and consumer applications, including plastics, rubber and fibre.

    - O&P North America segment—In North America, the group’s Olefins and Polymers business
comprises five sites including major facilities in Chocolate Bayou, Texas, and Battleground, Texas.

    - O&P Europe segment—In Europe, the Group owns and operates two major cracker complexes,
in Köln, Germany and Rafnes, Norway. This includes polymers and derivatives units.

    - Chemical Intermediates—This reportable segment is the aggregation, in compliance with
IFRS 8, of a number of different business units with similar economic and other characteristics.
Chemical Intermediates are high-value added chemical products used as key components in a
variety of consumer and industrial products. The Group’s chemical intermediates businesses are
exposed to similar key commodities, namely oil and gas. They produce a range of products
including phenol, alpha olefins, solvents, industrial chemicals and nitriles. The Chemical
Intermediates processes are similar in that they are all capital intensive and based upon processing
and mixing chemical raw materials to produce chemical products for the next stage along the
value chain. The Chemical Intermediates products are distributed on a business-to-business basis
across the world. This is performed using similar conventional methods of pipeline, truck, rail

or ship container depending on the customer location and size of the order. The Chemical
Intermediates customer base is similar in that the customers are generally manufacturers of
consumer and industrial products in developed markets and mature industrial economies.

The accounting policies of all of the reportable segments are as described in Note 1.

Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included in the following
tables. Performance is measured based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and
exceptional items, measured under IFRS (“Segment EBITDA”). A reconciliation to IFRS profit before tax is
presented in the following tables. Segment EBITDA is used to measure performance as management
believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to
other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length
basis. Information regarding segments reviewed by management includes management accounts comprising
the profit or loss, cash flows and other financial and non-financial information used to manage the
business.

Adjustments in the following tables comprise the following items:

    - Elimination of inter-segmental transactions and balances; and

     - The Group’s share of (loss)/profit in respect of the Refining joint venture.

In presenting information on the basis of geographic analysis of segments, segment revenue is
based on the geographical location of customers and geographical locations from which the Group derives
revenues.

Revenues from external customers for each product and service or each group of similar products
and services and a geographic analysis of segment assets are not presented as the necessary information is
not available and the Directors are of the opinion that the cost to develop it would be excessive.

All businesses within the group typically sell individual cargos based on agreed price with delivery
from the plant or at the customer premise. As such, the revenue is recognised as title passes, at a point in
time, and there are no arrangements of significance which transfer goods or services over time. No significant
contract balances arise. No costs to obtain or fulfil contracts are incurred, and therefore no related assets
arise.

**3. ACQUISITIONS**

**_Acquisition of subsidiary in the current year_**

**INESCO combined heat and power plant**

On March 1, 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of RWE Generation Belgium NV, the
owner of a Cogeneration unit on the Oxide Antwerp site in Belgium for cash consideration of €70.4 million.
The business consists of two 50MW units and an additional 35MW steam generator. All the steam and
approximately one third of the electricity is consumed by the Group and a number of co-siting companies
on the site in Antwerp. The remainder of the electricity is sold to the Belgian electricity grid, through a short
term marketing contract with the previous owner RWE. This acquisition forms part of the Chemical
Intermediates segment and is defined as a business under IFRS 3.

consideration of €162.1 million. The business is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas with production
facilities in Kentucky, South Dakota, Utah, Texas, and Wyoming. WL Plastics has over 500 million pounds
of annual production capacity and provides HDPE pipe for use in oil, gas, industrial, mining, conduit,
and municipal water and sewer applications. This acquisition forms part of the O&P North America segment.

2017: €2.5 million) which was the third instalment of the contingent consideration which was subject to the
acquired business achieving certain targets over a three year period. During the year ended December 31,
2017 the Group updated its deferred consideration assessment by €9.4 million.

**_Exceptional administrative expenses_**

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. Poor operating performance and uneconomic capital expenditure requirements to meet safety
and environmental obligations led to the decision. As a result an exceptional administrative charge of
€35.1 million was incurred for closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses, together with
decommissioning and demolition costs. In addition, tangible fixed assets at the facility of €33.3 million have
been impaired (see Note 10).

An exceptional administrative charge of €13.0 million was also incurred during 2019 relating to the
settlement of an intellectual property dispute in respect of the former Technologies business.

**_Exceptional finance costs_**

In April 2019 following the early redemption of the Senior Secured Notes due 2023, an exceptional
finance cost of €11.7 million was recognised which included an early prepayment premium of €7.7 million
and the write-off of deferred issue costs associated with the redeemed Notes of €4.0 million.

In February 2017, the Group completed a refinancing of the Senior Secured Term Loans and the
redemption of the Senior Notes due 2019. The Group has assessed that the refinancing of the Senior
Secured Term Loans represented a substantial modification and resulted in the extinguishment of the existing
debt. As a result the existing debt has been derecognised and the modified debt recognised at fair value.
Due to the substantial modification of the Senior Secured Term Loans, the unamortised issue costs of

Included in 2019 is an impairment charge of €33.3 million in respect of tangible fixed assets at the
Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United Kingdom following a decision to close the site in December 2019 due

Other intangible assets include shale oil and gas licences, non-compete agreements, licence fees and
environmental certificates.

**_Amortisation charge_**

The amortisation charge is recognised in administrative expenses in the consolidated income
statement.

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units (CGU) or groups of cash generating units as
follows:

**2019** **2018** **2017**

O&P Europe . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 246.2 246.2 246.2

The recoverable amount is based on the value in use of each operating segment before aggregation
based on the latest board approved five year plan. The forecasts are based on current performance and
management’s assumptions regarding the future development of individual parameters including raw
material prices and profit margins, utilising available market pricing forecasts. Future assumptions regarding
market demand are based on external macroeconomic sources and specific data relevant to the
petrochemical industry and management’s knowledge of the local markets in which it operates.

The cash flows after the plan period are based on an average of each of the years in the five year
plan to take account of the cyclical nature of the industry extrapolated using long term growth rates as set
out in the table below.

No impairment charge has been recorded in these financial statements as a result of the annual
impairment test.

The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation are shown below:

**2019** **2018** **2017**
Period on which management approved forecasts are
based . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 years 5 years 5 years
Discount rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.5% 8.5% 9.0%
Growth rate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.0% 3.0% 3.0%

A terminal value is calculated based on the average cash flows over the five year forecasting period
assuming compound growth of 3% and is discounted over the expected lives of the assets.

When determining the discount rate the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the Group is
considered at each respective period end.

The growth rate used includes inflationary growth across our various markets.

The estimated recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount for all cash generating units.

Sensitivity analysis on the recoverable amount was performed based on a 1% change in the discount
rate and a 1% change in the growth rate, both of which are considered reasonable. Neither of these changes
resulted in the recoverable amount being lower than the carrying amount. After applying the sensitivities
the business unit with the least amount of headroom is the Nitriles business, which has an excess recoverable
amount of €135 million over the carrying amount.

**_Joint ventures_**

On July 1, 2011 the group restructured the Refining business into a new joint venture between
PetroChina and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (‘II(J)L’), a related party. II(J)L is held under
common control by our controlling shareholders. The consideration received by the Group for the disposal
consisted of cash consideration of $1.015 billion received from PetroChina for a 50% interest in the
business and an investment in non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L for the other 50% interest in the business.

The Group retains an economic interest in the Refining business by virtue of its investment in
II(J)L. The results of the Refining business are reported within the share of profit/(loss) of associates and
joint ventures using the equity accounting method by virtue of the Group’s effective control of II(J)L.

In July 2014 the Group set up a joint venture with Sasol to build and operate an HDPE plant at
the Battleground site in Texas, USA. The plant became fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2017.
During 2018 € 12.9 million (2017: €57.8 million) was invested into the joint venture.

Before being disposed the Group held a non-voting preferred partnership interest in Ineos
Investments Partnership, an entity held under common control by the Group’s ultimate shareholders, which
owned 24% of the share capital of the PQ Corporation, a silicas business incorporated in the USA and
listed on the New York stock exchange. The Group previously held this investment at amortised cost under
IAS 39; however in 2018 as a result of IFRS 9 it was designated as a financial asset at fair value through
profit or loss. The remeasurement of this investment under IFRS 9 resulted in an adjustment to opening
equity of €6.1 million as at January 1, 2018.

In 2019 the Group disposed of its preferential interest in INEOS Investments Partnership following
the sale by INEOS Investments Partnership of its assets (shares in PQ Corporation) to INEOS Limited, a
related party, for €260.5 million ($296.5 million) which resulted in a profit on disposal of €2.6 million.

**_Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (previously other financial assets)_**

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include a 20.0% investment in
Aethylen Rohrleitungs Gesellschaft (‘ARG’) mbH and Co. KG, a company registered in Germany whose
principal activity is the transportation of ethylene via pipelines in Northern Europe and other investments.

In 2017 the investment in ARG mbH and Co. KG and other investments were classified as
available for sale financial assets and recorded at amortised cost; however in 2018 under IFRS 9 the Group
designated these investments as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. These
investments comprise of shares in private limited companies. The carrying value of these financial assets
at fair value through comprehensive income was €28.3 million at December 31, 2019 (2018: €28.3 million).
A disposal of these investments is not currently anticipated.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit
through future taxable profits is probable based on an assessment of expected future profits modelled
against the gross tax losses. The Group did not recognise gross deductible temporary differences of
€95.9 million (2018: €12.0 million, 2017: €71.7 million).

The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its overseas
subsidiaries or joint ventures as the Group can control the timing and realisation of these temporary
differences, and it is probable that no material unprovided tax liability would arise.

Trade receivable balances totalling €770.0 million (2018: € 921.2 million, 2017: €999.8 million) have
been pledged as security against amounts drawn down under the Receivables Securitisation Facility, described
in Note 19, totalling €297.1 million (2018: € 287.8 million, 2017: €284.2 million). In accordance with IFRS
9 ‘Financial Instruments’ the trade receivable balances pledged as security do not qualify for derecognition
and are included within the trade receivable balances above.

The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was
as follows:

The allowance account for trade receivables is used to record any impairment losses unless the
Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is probable; at that point the amounts considered
irrecoverable are written off against the trade receivables directly. As of January 1, 2018, IFRS 9 replaced the
‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model in assessing the
recoverability of trade receivables. Due to the quality of the Group’s trade receivables, and its low history of
bad debts the application of IFRS 9 did not result in a material change to the allowance for impairment in
respect of trade receivables. The impact was calculated considering past experience and management’s estimate
of future developments including the assessment of probability of default being relatively low. Management
expects no considerable change in the future market situation. Consequently, the future credit losses in
the ECL model are in the same range as the credit losses experienced in the past years. This is regarded as
the future expectation of the inherent credit risk of the not impaired trade and other receivables outstanding.
The Group reviews the assumptions of the ECL model on a yearly basis.

The credit risk grade is based on the analysis on both the quantitative and qualitative factors as
detailed below:

    - High: Customers under significant financial difficulty and customers for whom there is an
uncertainty of payment based on knowledge of factors like insolvency, dispute. Any receivable
more than 180 days past due should also be classified in this category.

**18. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (continued)**

    - Medium: Any receivable between 90 and 180 days past due should be classified as medium risk
unless qualitative factors indicate a higher credit risk.

     - Low: Any receivable less than 90 days past due should be classified as low risk unless qualitative
factors indicate a higher credit risk.

During the year the Group has not experienced a significant deterioration in the quality of
receivable balances due to the current economic conditions.

There were no allowances made against amounts due from other receivables during the year
(2018: €nil, 2017: €nil).

There were no allowances made against amounts due from related parties during the year
(2018: €nil, 2017: €nil).

**_Senior Secured Term Loans_**

The Group has outstanding borrowings under a senior credit facilities agreement (the ‘Senior
Secured Term Loans’ or ‘Term Loans’) dated April 27, 2012 (as amended and restated). The term Loans
are denominated in both Euros and US dollars and mature on March 31, 2024.

In February 2017, the Group completed a refinancing of the Senior Secured Term Loans. The
Term Loans due 2018 were repaid in full, the Term Loans due 2020 were extended to March 2022 and a
new tranche of €1.4 billion Term Loans due 2024 were issued. The entire facility was repriced and the
Applicable Margin on the Euro denominated Term Loans was reduced to 2.50% and on the US dollar
denominated Term Loans was reduced to 2.75%. The LIBOR floor was also reduced to 0.75% on the Euro
denominated Term Loans and was removed for the US dollar denominated Term Loans.

As a result of the substantial modification of the Senior Secured Term Loans in February 2017,
the unamortised issue costs at this date of € 23.6 million were written off (see Note 4).

In November 2017 the Group issued €550 million of Senior Secured Notes due 2025. The proceeds
from the new Notes, along with the proceeds from the full repayment of the Styrolution Term Loan (see
Note 29), were used to partially repay the Senior Secured Term Loans. The remaining Term Loans were
refinanced with a lower interest margin and a new maturity date of March 31, 2024.

The Senior Secured Term Loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 before issue costs were
€3,470.9 million (2018: €3,476.7 million, 2017: €3,450.5 million) of which €35.4 million (2018: € 35.1 million,
2017: €34.5 million) is due within one year. The total amounts outstanding on the Euro denominated
Term Loans were € 2,018.8 million and the US dollar denominated Term Loans were € 1,452.1 million.

The Term Loans are to be repaid in equal quarterly instalments, in aggregate annual amounts
equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans. The Term Loans mature on March 31,
2024.

The outstanding Term Loans denominated in US dollars bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
LIBOR plus the Applicable Margin. The Term Loans denominated in Euros bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to EURIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.50% per annum) plus the Applicable Margin.

As at December 31, 2019 the Applicable Margin for the Euro denominated Term Loans and the US
dollar denominated Term Loans was 2.00%.

The Senior Secured Term Loans rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes due 2026, Senior
Secured Notes due 2025 and are structurally senior to the Senior Notes due 2024. The notes are guaranteed
by INEOS Group Holdings S.A., INEOS Holdings Limited and certain of their subsidiaries on a senior
secured basis. The Term Loans and the guarantees are secured by first ranking liens on the same assets
(subject to certain exceptions) that secure INEOS Holdings Limited’s obligations under the senior secured
notes.

**21. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS**

**_Pension plans_**

The Group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with
local conditions and practices. The plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by
payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies. The principal funded plans are in the
United Kingdom, North America, Belgium, Norway and Switzerland.

The Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit pension schemes in Germany and
France.

The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit plans were carried out as follows:

**Plan** **Country** **Valuation date**
All Plans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . United Kingdom 31 December 2016 and 5 April 2019
All Plans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . North America 1 January 2019

All Plans . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Switzerland 31 December 2019

These valuations have been updated where appropriate to December 31, 2019 by independent
qualified actuaries.

The Group’s pension schemes have been disclosed on a geographical basis as those schemes in the
United Kingdom, North America and Other European. Other European principally includes the Group’s
pension plans in Germany, Belgium, Norway, France and Switzerland.

The UK defined benefit pension plans were historically final salary in nature, with a normal
retirement age of 60. The majority of the UK plans are either closed to new entrants, or frozen to future
accrual. The plans operate under trust law and are managed and administered by Trustees in accordance with
the terms of each plan’s Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation. The contributions paid to the UK
plans are set every three years based on a funding agreement between the company and Trustee after taking
actuarial advice.

The North American pension arrangements consist of two funded plans, both closed to new
entrants and future accrual. Both plans were final salary defined benefit in nature, and the plans’ liabilities
are valued regularly in line with US statutory funding requirements. Around 90% of both plans’ assets are
invested in bond instruments, to closely match the profile of each plans’ liabilities.

The Other European pension arrangements are primarily final salary in nature, the majority of
which remain open to new entrants. The Norwegian and Swiss benefits are insured, the Belgian plan assets
are held in trust, and the remaining schemes are unfunded with associated provisions held on the Group’s
balance sheet.

**_Pension plan assumptions_**

The principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages or ranges) at the year end
were as follows:

**United Kingdom** **North America** **Other European**
**2019** **2018** **2017** **2019 2018 2017** **2019** **2018** **2017**

**21. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (continued)**

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the reporting date are
based on standard actuarial mortality tables and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity.
The assumptions are equivalent to expecting a 65-year old to live for a number of years as follows:

**United Kingdom** **North America** **Other European**
**2019** **2018** **2017** **2019** **2018** **2017** **2019** **2018** **2017**

The following table presents the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to each significant
actuarial assumption:

**United** **North** **Other**
**Kingdom** **America** **European**
**2019**
**%**
**Major assumptions**
Discount rate: 1.0% decrease . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23.0 13.8 20.1
Rate of inflation: 0.5% increase[(1)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7.9 N/A 4.9
One year increase in longevity for a member currently aged 65 . . . . . . . . . . . 3.6 0.7 3.5

(1) The sensitivity to the inflation assumption change includes corresponding changes to the future salary increase and future
pension increase assumptions where these assumptions are set to be linked to the inflation assumption.

**_Post-retirement health care plans_**

The Group also operates a number of post retirement healthcare plans in the United States, which
provide employees with other post-employment benefits in respect of health care. The plans are unfunded
and the liability in respect of these benefits is included in provisions. The liability is assessed by qualified
independent actuaries under the projected unit method, assuming the following rates:

**Rates** **2019** **2018** **2017**

**_Severance and restructuring costs_**

The severance and restructuring costs includes €15.6 million relating to the Köln site following a
reorganisation within the O&P North business in 2015 and €2.1 million following a Group restructuring of
the Technologies business in 2016. Both these provisions are expected to be fully utilised within the next
5 years.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. As a result a severance and restructuring provision was made for €16.3 million in respect of
closure costs including severance and outplacement expenses (see Note 4). The provision is expected to be
fully utilised within the next two years.

**_Remediation costs_**

The Group has provided for the cost of remediation works of €13.2 million where there is a legal
or constructive obligation for such work to be carried out. Provisions are established to meet the clean-up
costs of contaminated soil and groundwater, the removal of potentially hazardous substances and rectification
work required to ensure compliance with license to operate obligations. These costs relate mainly to the
Group’s production facilities at the Köln, Chocolate Bayou, Green Lake and Lima sites and a pilot plant at
the Lavera site. The provision only covers items of specific work for which a reasonable estimate can be
determined. By their nature the amounts and timing of any outflows in respect of remediation costs are
difficult to predict.

In December 2019 the Group took the decision to close the Nitriles facility at Seal Sands, United
Kingdom. As a result a remediation provision was made for €18.8 million in respect of decommissioning
and demolition costs (see Note 4). The provision is expected to be fully utilised within the next two years.

**_Other provisions_**

Other provisions primarily relates to a commercial disputes in respect of a licencing agreements
and are expected to be fully utilised within the next year.

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**25a Fair value of financial instruments**

**_Investments in debt and equity securities_**

The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (previously other investments)
is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are accounted for at fair value
based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily available based on the
present value of future cash flows estimated from financial information made available during the year as a
result of a recent transaction in the investment. However, as explained in Note 14, the Group’s financial
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income include certain equity interests which are not quoted
and for which there is no active market. The Group considers that the acquisition cost to be a reasonable
approximation for fair value.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other receivables generally approximates to fair value due to
their short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair
value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date.

**_Trade and other payables_**

The carrying amount of trade and other payables generally approximates to fair value due to their
short maturities. Where settlement is not due in the short term and where the effect is material, fair value is
estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting
date.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is
repayable on demand. Where it is not repayable on demand then the fair value is estimated at the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

The Group’s non-voting preferred partnership interest in Ineos Investments Partnership, an entity
held under common control by the Group’s ultimate shareholders was previously classified as other
investments and held at amortised cost under IAS 39; however at January 1, 2018 this investment was
designated as a financial asset at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9 and was subsequently
disposed of during 2019 (see Note 13). The Group’s equity investments which are held for long-term strategic
purposes were previously classified as available-for-sale and held at amortised cost under IAS 39; however
at January 1, 2018 the Group designated these investments as financial assets at fair value through other
comprehensive income (see Note 14).

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The
different levels, determined in accordance with IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, have been defined as
follows:

     - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

     - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and

     - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

The commodity derivatives are fair valued using rates in a quoted market. There have been no
transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 in 2019 (2018 and 2017: no transfers from Level 2 to Level 1). In prior years
the investment held at fair value through profit or loss and equity securities held at fair value though other
comprehensive income were classified as amortised cost and available for sale assets, respectively.

**25b Net gains and losses from financial instruments**

Net gains and losses from financial instruments comprise the results of valuations, the amortisation
of discounts, the recognition and derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign
currencies, interest, dividends and all effects on profit or loss of financial instruments.

Net gains from financial assets measured at amortised cost relate primarily to recognition and
derecognition of impairment losses, results from the translation of foreign currencies and interest income.

Net losses from financial liabilities measured at amortised cost relate primarily to amortisation of
discounts, results from the translation of foreign currencies, interest expense and other financing related
expenses.

The item ‘financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss’ comprise valuation gains and
losses, and only includes gains and losses from instruments which are not designated as hedging instruments
as defined by IFRS 9.

**25c Credit risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial
instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from
customers, deposits with financial institutions and derivatives.

Group Treasury policy and objectives in relation to credit risk is to minimize the likelihood that the
Group will experience financial loss due to counterparty failure and to ensure that in the event of a single
loss, the failure of any single counterparty would not materially impact the financial wellbeing of the Group.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

**_Trade and other receivables_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each
customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group’s customer base, including
the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an
influence on credit risk. Management considers that there is no geographical concentration of credit risk.
The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for
creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered or are
adjusted accordingly. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases
bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represent the maximum open
amount without requiring approval. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness
may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.

**_Investments, cash and cash equivalent_**

Surplus cash investments are only made with banks with which the Group has a relationship.
Occasionally deposits are made with banking counterparties that provide financing arrangements, reducing
the credit exposure of the Group.

**_Guarantees_**

The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries. At
December 31, 2019 no guarantees were outstanding (2018: none, 2017: none).

**_Exposure to credit risk_**

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Therefore, the
maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was the carrying amount of financial assets. Further
details on the Group’s exposure to credit risk are given in Note 18.

**25d Liquidity risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have
sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group. The Group’s exposure to liquidity risk is limited by
the fact that it operates with significant cash resources, and it maintains the most appropriate mix of short,
medium and long-term borrowings from the Group’s lenders.

The Group is reliant on committed funding from a variety of sources at Group and subsidiary
company level to meet the anticipated needs of the Group for the period covered by the Group’s budget.

The Group forecasts on a regular basis the expected cash flows that will occur on a weekly and
monthly basis. This information is used in conjunction with the weekly reporting of actual cash balances at
bank in order to calculate the level of funding that will be required in the short and medium term. On a
monthly basis the level of headroom on existing facilities is reported and forecast forward until the end of
the financial period.

In addition, the Group maintains various lines of credits in the form of Senior Notes, Senior
Secured Notes, Senior Secured Term Loans, Securitisation, Noretyl Facility, Koln CoGen Facility and
Other Loans. (See Note 19—”Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings” for more information).

The Group does not have derivative commodity contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2019.

The Group has US$ and Sterling financial liabilities in respect of the Senior Secured Term Loans,
Senior Notes and Securitisation Facility that are designated net investment hedges of US$ and Sterling
operations in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. The US$ and Sterling net investment hedges had
a carrying value and fair value as follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2019 gains net of tax of €88.0 million were taken directly to
reserves and reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended (2018: gains
€271.3 million, 2017: losses €637.5 million). There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2019 (2018: €nil, 2017: €nil). The cumulative net investment hedge
reserve amount as at December 31, 2019 was €490.9 million (2018: €402.9 million, 2017: €131.6 million).

**25f Market risk**

**_Financial risk management_**

Market risk reflects the possibility that changes in market prices, such as crude oil, feedstock
refined products, chemicals or currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates will adversely affect the
value of the Group’s assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Group holds commodity contracts
in order to manage market risk. The use of derivative instruments is confined to specialist teams that have
the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.

**_Market risk—Foreign currency risk_**

The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the U.S. Dollar and Sterling.


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

Foreign exchange risk arises from net investments in foreign operations, future commercial
transactions, and recognised assets and liabilities.

The Group applies hedge accounting to foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of
a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. When the settlement of
a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the
foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item is considered to
form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and changes in the fair value are recognised directly
within equity.

A substantial portion of the Group’s revenue is generated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar and the
euro. In the European petrochemical business, product prices, certain feedstock costs and most other costs
are denominated in euro and sterling. In the U.S. petrochemical and specialty chemicals businesses, product
prices, raw materials costs and most other costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Group generally does not enter into foreign currency exchange instruments to hedge foreign
currency transaction exposure, although the Group has done so in the past and may do so in the future.

The Group benefits from natural hedging, to the extent that currencies in which net cash flows are
generated from the Group’s operations, are matched against long-term indebtedness.

The foreign currency exposure where the Group’s external financial assets/(liabilities) are not
denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved is shown below. Foreign exchange
differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the other comprehensive income of the
Group.

**_Sensitivity analysis_**

A change of 1% in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) equity and
profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the
reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.

This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant
and considers the effect of financial instruments with variable interest rates, financial instrument at fair
value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and the fixed rate element of interest
rate caps. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2019, 2018 and 2017.

A 1% change in the opposite direction of the above interest rates at December 31, would have had
the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all
other variables remain constant.

**_Market risk—Commodity price risk_**

This section discusses the Group’s exposure to the commodity contracts which are not covered
under the own use exemption and are recognised as derivative instruments.

The Group is exposed to commodity price risk through fluctuations in raw material prices and
sales of products. The raw material exposures result primarily from the price of crude oil and base chemicals
linked to the price of crude. The sales price exposures are primarily related to petrochemicals where prices
are in general linked to the market price of crude oil.

The Group enters into contracts to supply or acquire physical volumes of commodities at future
dates during the normal course of business that may be considered derivative contracts. Where such
contracts exist and are in respect of the normal purchase or sale of products to fulfil the Group’s
requirements, the own use exemption from derivative accounting is applied.

The Group manages commodity price exposures through trading refined products and chemical
feedstock and using commodity swaps, options and futures as a means of managing price and timing risks.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**25. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)**

In 2019 there was a net mark to market derivative liability in respect of commodity contracts of €44.2 million
entered into by the Group to manage such risk (2018:net derivative asset of €9.7 million, 2017: net derivative
liability of €2.3 million).

The Group operates within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those
relating to the default of counterparties, are minimised.

**_Market risk—Equity price risk_**

The Group’s exposure to equity price risk arises from its investment in equity securities which are
classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial assets are
accounted for at fair value based on the present value of future cash flows where such information is readily
available.

For the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income a 10 percent increase and
decrease in transaction prices at the reporting date would have decreased and increased the loss for the year
by €2.8 million (2018: €2.8 million, 2017: €2.8 million). Management consider that a change of 10 percent
gives an appropriate benchmark to assess the risks that the Group is expected to be exposed to. This calculation
assumes that the change occurred at the reporting date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at
that date. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.

**Capital management**

The Group’s objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Group defines its capital employed of €7,397.9 million (2018: €7,148.8 million, 2017:
€6,488.4 million) as shareholders’ equity of €1,528.0 million (2018: €2,917.5 million, 2017: €1,696.8 million)
and net debt (net of debt issue costs) of €5,869.9 million (2018: €4,231.3 million, 2017: €4,791.6 million).

The principal sources of debt available to the Group at December 31, 2019 include the Senior
Secured Term Loans, Senior Secured Notes due 2026, Senior Secured Notes due 2025, Senior Notes due
2024, Receivables Securitisation Facility, Inventory Financing Facility, Schuldschien loan, Noretyl Facility
and Koln CoGen Facility and are described in Note 19 along with the key operating and financial covenants
that apply to these facilities.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends
paid to shareholders, issue new shares, raise new debt or sell assets to reduce debt. The ability of the Group
to pay dividends and provide appropriate facilities to the Group is restricted by the terms of principal
financing agreements to which members of the Group are party.

In March 2019 the Group received €260.5 million ($296.5 million) of proceeds in relation to the
repayment of the Group’s preferential interest in INEOS Investments Partnership following the sale by
INEOS Investments Partnership of its assets (shares in PQ Corporation) to INEOS Limited. The Group

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**29. RELATED PARTIES (continued)**

During 2019 the Group entered into a number of derivative contracts with INEOS UK SNS
Limited and INEOS Energy Trading Limited, both related parties. The net fair value loss on these derivatives
during the year ended December 31, 2019 was €80.3 million. As at December 31, 2019, the mark to
market derivative asset was €15.3 million and the mark to market liability was €54.5 million in respect of
these related party derivative financial instruments (see Note 15).

**_Compensation to key management personnel (including directors)_**

The Group defines key management as the directors of the Company. Details of Directors’
remuneration are given in Note 7.

**30. ULTIMATE PARENT UNDERTAKING AND CONTROLLING PARTY**

The immediate parent undertaking is Ineos Holdings Luxembourg S.A.. The ultimate parent
undertaking at December 31, 2019 was Ineos Limited, a company registered in the Isle of Man. The
ultimate controlling party is Mr JA Ratcliffe, director and majority shareholder of the ultimate parent
undertaking. Ineos Group Holdings S.A. and its subsidiaries are not included within any other consolidated
financial statements.

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS**

The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, which require
management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions which affect the application of the accounting
policies, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates change and in any future periods.

**Critical accounting judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The key accounting judgement taken in the preparation of these financial statements relates to our
interest in the refining business formerly owned by Group (see Note 12). The refining Business is now
owned by Petro China and INEOS Investments (Jersey) Limited (“II(J)L”), which in turn is held under
common control by the Group’s controlling Shareholders. The Group has an economic interest in II(J)L
via non-voting ordinary shares in II(J)L.

The Group has evaluated its interest in II(J)L and in the refining business, and has concluded that
it has effective control over II(J)L by virtue of the facts that the Group is subject to exposure and rights to
the variable returns from II(J)L, II(J)L is held under common control with the Group’s controlling shareholder
and has the same directors as the Group. As a result, II(J)L is treated as a subsidiary of the Group, and
therefore the Refining business is treated as a jointly venture under the equity accounting method, and the
company reflects its 50% share in the profits and losses of the refining Business in its income statement. (see
also Note 1, Accounting policies).

**Key sources of estimated uncertainty**

Estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that the
Group believe are reasonable, including assets and expected economic conditions, and in certain cases
actuarial assumption. Although these estimates are based on the Group’s knowledge of current events and
circumstances, actual numbers may differ.

**_Taxation_**

Management is required to estimate the tax payable in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. This involves estimating the actual current tax charge or credit together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. The calculation of the
Group’s total tax charge necessarily involves a significant degree of estimation in respect of certain items

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)**

whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax
authority, or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.

The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate
transactions in the countries in which it operates. After appropriate consideration, management makes
provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which
is reliably measurable.

The breadth of the Group’s structure with operations in many geographic locations makes the use
of estimates and assumptions more challenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the control of
the Group and can be reliant upon the efficiency of the legal processes in the relevant jurisdictions in
which the Group operates, and as a result, issues can, and often do take many years to resolve.

Details of amounts recognised with regard to taxation are disclosed in Notes 9 and 16. Note 9 shows
tax adjustments in respect of prior years of €5.6 million but this has been higher in previous periods and
material adjustments may arise in future years.

**_Impairment_**

Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually or if there is an indication of impairment.
Goodwill impairments tests are based on cash generating units and compare the recoverable amount of the
unit with the respective carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is
the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The value in use is determined using a
discounted cash flow method, considering earnings forecasts of the unit. The management of the Group
identified the operating segments as cash generating units (CGU) for purposes of testing goodwill for
impairment. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated to shall represent the lowest level
within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purpose. The goodwill is
internally monitored at the level of business units.

Impairment losses on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognised when the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit which includes the asset is lower than the respective carrying
amount. In accordance with the definition of a cash generating unit under IAS 36, the individual production
plants generally do not represent separate cash generating units, but are part of larger asset groups that
form the cash generating units. Since the assessment whether goodwill or property, plant and equipment are
impaired is based on long-term business plans for the cash generating units and the determination of an
appropriate discount rate, management used significant estimates and assumptions in making these
assessments.

Details on the estimates used for the goodwill impairment test are disclosed in Note 11.

The Group currently has significant headroom across all its business segments, but monitors the
principal risk and uncertainties set out in the Management Report when assessing its business. After
applying the sensitivities the business unit with the least amount of headroom is the Nitriles business, which
has an excess recoverable amount of €135 million over the carrying amount.

**_Post-retirement benefits_**

The Group operates a number of defined benefit post employment schemes. Under IAS 19 Revised
Employee Benefits, management is required to estimate the present value of the future defined benefit
obligation of each of the defined benefit schemes. The costs and year end obligations under defined benefit
schemes are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve making numerous
assumptions, including:

     - Future rate of increase in salaries;

     - Inflation rate projections;

**31. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (continued)**

     - Discount rate for scheme liabilities; and

    - Expected rates of return on the scheme assets.

Details of post-retirement benefits and sensitivities on key assumptions are set out in Note 21.

**32. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

The withdrawal agreement under which the United Kingdom will leave the European Union was
ratified on 31 January 2020. This has started a transition period until the end of December 2020. The
Group has limited activities in the United Kingdom so does not expect a significant financial impact on its
business from Brexit.

The Group is closely monitoring the evolution of the COVID-19 coronavirus and is following the
World Health Organisation travel advice. With regards to business impact, the effect the virus will have on
the global economy and the chemicals industry is difficult to assess at this point in time, although the Group
is constantly evaluating the situation and monitoring any potential effects on production and deliveries.
